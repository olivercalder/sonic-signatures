i learn in this letter that don pedro of aragon comes this night to messina how many gentlemen have you lost in this action a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers i find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young florentine called claudio he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it did he break out into tears a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces truer than those that are so washed how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping what is he that you ask for niece faith niece you tax signior benedick too much but he'll be meet with you i doubt it not you must not sir mistake my niece there is a kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them you will never run mad niece never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave her mother hath many times told me so signior benedick no for then were you a child if you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to the prince your brother i owe you all duty please it your grace lead on how now brother where is my cousin your son hath he provided this music are they good hath the fellow any wit that told you this no no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but i will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true go you and tell her of it cousins you know what you have to do o i cry you mercy friend go you with me and i will use your skill good cousin have a care this busy time was not count john here at supper then half signior benedick's tongue in count john's mouth and half count john's melancholy in signior benedick's face  by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue so by being too curst god will send you no horns you may light on a husband that hath no beard well then go you into hell well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband daughter remember what i told you if the prince do solicit you in that kind you know your answer cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly the revelers are entering brother make good room count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match and all grace say amen to it niece will you look to those things i told you of there's little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit o lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad not till monday my dear son which is hence a just sevennight and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights' watchings no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it what effects my lord she will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how i would have sworn it had my lord especially against benedick no and swears she never will that's her torment this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for she'll be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her i measure him says she by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometimes afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian were it good think you if he do fear god he must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling nay that's impossible she may wear her heart out first my lord will you walk dinner is ready so say i methinks you are sadder where is but a humor or a worm indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard what would you with me honest neighbor brief i pray you for you see it is a busy time with me what is it my good friends neighbors you are tedious all thy tediousness on me ah i would fain know what you have to say indeed neighbor he comes too short of you i must leave you take their examination yourself and bring it me i am now in great haste as it may appear unto you drink some wine ere you go fare you well i'll wait upon them i am ready come friar francis be brief only to the plain form of marriage and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards to be married to her friar you come to marry her i dare make his answer none as freely son as god did give her me what do you mean my lord dear my lord if you in your own proof have vanquished the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity  sweet prince why speak not you are these things spoken or do i but dream all this is so but what of this my lord i charge thee do so as thou art my child hath no man's dagger here a point for me o fate take not away thy heavy hand death is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wished for dost thou look up wherefore why doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her could she here deny the story that is printed in her blood  do not live hero do not ope thine eyes for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rearward of reproaches strike at thy life grieved i i had but one chid i for that at frugal nature's frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggar's issue at my gates who smirch√®d thus and mired with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised and mine that i was proud on mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of her why she o she is fall'n into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foul tainted flesh confirmed confirmed o that is stronger made which was before barred up with ribs of iron would the two princes lie and claudio lie who loved her so that speaking of her foulness washed it with tears hence from her let her die friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness i know not if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honor the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awaked in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly what shall become of this what will this do being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me i pray thee cease thy counsel which falls into mine ears as profitless as water in a sieve give not me counsel nor let no comforter delight mine ear but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine bring me a father that so loved his child whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine and bid him speak of patience measure his woe the length and breadth of mine and let it answer every strain for strain as thus for thus and such a grief for such in every lineament branch shape and form if such a one will smile and stroke his beard bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk with candle wasters bring him yet to me and i of him will gather patience but there is no such man for brother men can counsel and speak comfort to that grief which they themselves not feel but tasting it their counsel turns to passion which before would give preceptial med'cine to rage fetter strong madness in a silken thread charm ache with air and agony with words no no 'tis all men's office to speak patience to those that wring under the load of sorrow but no man's virtue nor sufficiency to be so moral when he shall endure the like himself therefore give me no counsel my griefs cry louder than advertisement i pray thee peace i will be flesh and blood for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently however they have writ the style of gods and made a push at chance and sufferance there thou speak'st reason nay i will do so my soul doth tell me hero is belied and that shall claudio know so shall the prince and all of them that thus dishonor her hear you my lords  some haste my lord well fare you well my lord are you so hasty now well all is one marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword i fear thee not tush tush man never fleer and jest at me i speak not like a dotard nor a fool as under privilege of age to brag what i have done being young or what would do were i not old know claudio to thy head thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me that i am forced to lay my reverence by and with gray hairs and bruise of many days do challenge thee to trial of a man i say thou hast belied mine innocent child thy slander hath gone through and through her heart and she lies buried with her ancestors o in a tomb where never scandal slept save this of hers framed by thy villainy thine claudio thine i say my lord my lord i'll prove it on his body if he dare despite his nice fence and his active practice his may of youth and bloom of lustihood canst thou so daff me
