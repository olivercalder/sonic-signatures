each day still better other's happiness until the heavens envying earth's good hap add an immortal title to your crown let not my cold words here accuse my zeal 'tis not the trial of a woman's war the bitter clamor of two eager tongues can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain the blood is hot that must be cooled for this yet can i not of such tame patience boast as to be hushed and naught at all to say first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me from giving reins and spurs to my free speech which else would post until it had returned these terms of treason doubled down his throat setting aside his high blood's royalty and let him be no kinsman to my liege i do defy him and i spit at him call him a slanderous coward and a villain which to maintain i would allow him odds and meet him were i tied to run afoot even to the frozen ridges of the alps or any other ground inhabitable wherever englishman durst set his foot meantime let this defend my loyalty by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie i take it up and by that sword i swear which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder i'll answer thee in any fair degree or chivalrous design of knightly trial and when i mount alive may i not light if i be traitor or unjustly fight o let my sovereign turn away his face and bid his ears a little while be deaf till i have told this slander of his blood how god and good men hate so foul a liar then bolingbroke as low as to thy heart through the false passage of thy throat thou liest three parts of that receipt i had for calais disbursed i duly to his highness' soldiers the other part reserved i by consent for that my sovereign liege was in my debt upon remainder of a dear account since last i went to france to fetch his queen now swallow down that lie for gloucester's death i slew him not but to my own disgrace neglected my sworn duty in that case  for you my noble lord of lancaster the honorable father to my foe once did i lay an ambush for your life a trespass that doth vex my grievèd soul but ere i last received the sacrament i did confess it and exactly begged your grace's pardon and i hope i had it  this is my fault as for the rest appealed it issues from the rancor of a villain a recreant and most degenerate traitor which in myself i boldly will defend and interchangeably hurl down my gage upon this overweening traitor's foot to prove myself a loyal gentleman even in the best blood chambered in his bosom in haste whereof most heartily i pray your highness to assign our trial day myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot my life thou shalt command but not my shame the one my duty owes but my fair name despite of death that lives upon my grave to dark dishonor's use thou shalt not have i am disgraced impeached and baffled here pierced to the soul with slander's venomed spear the which no balm can cure but his heart blood which breathed this poison yea but not change his spots take but my shame and i resign my gage my dear dear lord the purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless reputation that away men are but gilded loam or painted clay a jewel in a ten times barred up chest is a bold spirit in a loyal breast mine honor is my life both grow in one take honor from me and my life is done then dear my liege mine honor let me try in that i live and for that will i die my name is thomas mowbray duke of norfolk who hither come engagèd by my oath  which god defend a knight should violate  both to defend my loyalty and truth to god my king and my succeeding issue against the duke of hereford that appeals me and by the grace of god and this mine arm to prove him in defending of myself a traitor to my god my king and me and as i truly fight defend me heaven however god or fortune cast my lot there lives or dies true to king richard's throne a loyal just and upright gentleman never did captive with a freer heart cast off his chains of bondage and embrace his golden uncontrolled enfranchisement more than my dancing soul doth celebrate this feast of battle with mine adversary most mighty liege and my companion peers take from my mouth the wish of happy years as gentle and as jocund as to jest go i to fight truth hath a quiet breast a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege and all unlooked for from your highness' mouth a dearer merit not so deep a maim as to be cast forth in the common air have i deservèd at your highness' hands the language i have learnt these forty years my native english now i must forgo and now my tongue's use is to me no more than an unstringèd viol or a harp or like a cunning instrument cased up or being open put into his hands that knows no touch to tune the harmony within my mouth you have enjailed my tongue doubly portcullised with my teeth and lips and dull unfeeling barren ignorance is made my jailor to attend on me i am too old to fawn upon a nurse too far in years to be a pupil now what is thy sentence then but speechless death which robs my tongue from breathing native breath then thus i turn me from my country's light to dwell in solemn shades of endless night and i to keep all this no bolingbroke if ever i were traitor my name be blotted from the book of life and i from heaven banished as from hence but what thou art god thou and i do know and all too soon i fear the king shall rue  farewell my liege now no way can i stray save back to england all the world's my way
