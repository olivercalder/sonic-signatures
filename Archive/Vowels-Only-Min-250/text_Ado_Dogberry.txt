are you good men and true nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the prince's watch first who think you the most desartless man to be constable come hither neighbor seacoal god hath blessed you with a good name to be a well favored man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature you have i knew it would be your answer well for your favor sir why give god thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lantern this is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the prince's name why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave true and they are to meddle with none but the prince's subjects you shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for i cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty truly by your office you may but i think they that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company truly i would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baas will never answer a calf when he bleats this is the end of the charge you constable are to present the prince's own person if you meet the prince in the night you may stay him five shillings to one on 't with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offense to stay a man against his will ha ah ha well masters goodnight an there be any matter of weight chances call up me keep your fellows' counsels and your own and goodnight

masters do not forget to specify when time and place shall serve that i am an ass moreover sir which indeed is not under white and black this plaintiff here the offender did call me ass i beseech you

used so long and never paid that now men grow hardhearted and will lend nothing for god's sake pray you examine him upon that point your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth and i praise god for you god save the foundation i leave an arrant knave with your worship which i beseech your worship to correct yourself for the example of others god keep your worship i wish your worship well god restore you to health i humbly give you leave to depart and if a merry meeting may be wished god prohibit it  come neighbor
