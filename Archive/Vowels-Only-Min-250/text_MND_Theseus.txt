now fair hippolyta our nuptial hour draws on apace four happy days bring in another moon but o methinks how slow this old moon wanes she lingers my desires like to a stepdame or a dowager long withering out a young man's revenue go philostrate stir up the athenian youth to merriments awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth turn melancholy forth to funerals the pale companion is not for our pomp hippolyta i wooed thee with my sword and won thy love doing thee injuries but i will wed thee in another key with pomp with triumph and with reveling thanks good egeus what's the news with thee what say you hermia be advised fair maid to you your father should be as a god one that composed your beauties yea and one to whom you are but as a form in wax by him imprinted and within his power to leave the figure or disfigure it demetrius is a worthy gentleman in himself he is but in this kind wanting your father's voice the other must be held the worthier rather your eyes must with his judgment look either to die the death or to abjure forever the society of men therefore fair hermia question your desires know of your youth examine well your blood whether if you yield not to your father's choice you can endure the livery of a nun for aye to be in shady cloister mewed to live a barren sister all your life chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon thrice blessèd they that master so their blood to undergo such maiden pilgrimage but earthlier happy is the rose distilled than that which withering on the virgin thorn grows lives and dies in single blessedness take time to pause and by the next new moon the sealing day betwixt my love and me for everlasting bond of fellowship upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your father's will or else to wed demetrius as he would or on diana's altar to protest for aye austerity and single life i must confess that i have heard so much and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof but being overfull of self affairs my mind did lose it but demetrius come and come egeus you shall go with me i have some private schooling for you both  for you fair hermia look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your father's will or else the law of athens yields you up which by no means we may extenuate to death or to a vow of single life  come my hippolyta what cheer my love  demetrius and egeus go along i must employ you in some business against our nuptial and confer with you of something nearly that concerns yourselves go one of you find out the forester for now our observation is performed and since we have the vaward of the day my love shall hear the music of my hounds uncouple in the western valley let them go dispatch i say and find the forester we will fair queen up to the mountain's top and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind so flewed so sanded and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew crook kneed and dewlapped like thessalian bulls slow in pursuit but matched in mouth like bells each under each a cry more tunable was never holloed to nor cheered with horn in crete in sparta nor in thessaly judge when you hear but soft what nymphs are these no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may and hearing our intent came here in grace of our solemnity but speak egeus is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns good morrow friends saint valentine is past begin these woodbirds but to couple now i pray you all stand up i know you two are rival enemies how comes this gentle concord in the world that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate and fear no enmity fair lovers you are fortunately met of this discourse we more will hear anon  egeus i will overbear your will for in the temple by and by with us these couples shall eternally be knit  and for the morning now is something worn our purposed hunting shall be set aside away with us to athens three and three we'll hold a feast in great solemnity come hippolyta more strange than true i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys lovers and madmen have such seething brains such shaping fantasies that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends the lunatic the lover and the poet are of imagination all compact one sees more devils than vast hell can hold that is the madman the lover all as frantic sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt the poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poet's pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name such tricks hath strong imagination that if it would but apprehend some joy it comprehends some bringer of that joy or in the night imagining some fear how easy is a bush supposed a bear here come the lovers full of joy and mirth  joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts come now what masques what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our after supper and bedtime where is our usual manager of mirth what revels are in hand is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour call philostrate say what abridgment have you for this evening what masque what music how shall we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight the battle with the centaurs to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp we'll none of that that have i told my love in glory of my kinsman hercules the riot of the tipsy bacchanals tearing the thracian singer in their rage that is an old device and it was played when i from thebes came last a conqueror the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning late deceased in beggary that is some satire keen and critical not sorting with a nuptial ceremony a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe very tragical mirth merry and tragical tedious and brief that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow how shall we find the concord of this discord what are they that do play it and we will hear it i will hear that play for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it go bring them in and take your places ladies why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing our sport shall be to take what they mistake and what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes it in might not merit where i have come great clerks have purposèd to greet me with premeditated welcomes where i have seen them shiver and look pale make periods in the midst of sentences throttle their practiced accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off not paying me a welcome trust me sweet out of this silence yet i picked a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence love therefore and tongue tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity let him approach this fellow doth not stand upon points his speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered who is next i wonder if the lion be to speak would you desire lime and hair to speak better pyramus draws near the wall silence the wall methinks being sensible should curse again now is the wall down between the two neighbors the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion a very gentle beast and of a good conscience true and a goose for his discretion his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valor for the goose carries not the fox it is well leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lanthorn how is it else the man i' th' moon it appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time well run thisbe well moused lion this passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet prove an ass she will find him by starlight here she comes and her passion ends the play moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no excuse never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed marry if he that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself in thisbe's garter it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged but come your bergomask let your epilogue alone the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve lovers to bed 'tis almost fairy time i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn as much as we this night have overwatched this palpable gross play hath well beguiled the heavy gait of night sweet friends to bed a fortnight hold we this solemnity in nightly revels and new jollity
