the clownish fool out of your father's court would he not be a comfort to our travel o jupiter how weary are my spirits i could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel and to cry like a woman

shepherd's passion is much upon my fashion peace fool he's not thy kinsman peace i say good even to you friend i prithee shepherd if that love or gold can in this desert place buy entertainment bring

thou the cottage pasture and the flock and thou shalt have to pay for it of us from the east to western ind no jewel is like rosalind her worth being mounted on the wind through all the world bears rosalind all the pictures fairest lined are but black to rosalind let no face be kept in mind but the fair of rosalind out fool peace you dull fool i found them on a tree i'll graft it with you and then i shall graft it with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country for you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe and that's the right virtue of the medlar peace here comes my sister reading stand aside o most gentle jupiter what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal and never cried have patience good people o yes i heard them all and more too for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear ay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came for look here what i found on a palm tree i was never so berhymed since pythagoras' time that i was an irish rat which i can hardly remember is it a man i prithee who nay but who is it nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it is good my complexion dost thou think though i am caparisoned like a man i have a doublet and hose in my disposition one inch of delay more is a south sea of discovery i prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace i would thou couldst stammer that thou might'st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at all i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that i may drink thy tidings is he of god's making what manner of man is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard why god will send more if the man will be thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and true maid orlando alas the day what shall i do with my doublet and hose what did he when thou saw'st him what said he how looked he wherein went he what makes he here did he ask for me where remains he how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see him again answer me in one word but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man's apparel looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled it may well be called jove's tree when it drops forth such fruit proceed though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground o ominous he comes to kill my heart do you not know i am a woman when i think i must speak sweet say on 'tis he slink by and note him i will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him do you hear forester i pray you what is 't o'clock then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock by no means sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons i'll tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a se'nnight time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal there were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that fancy monger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him there is none of my uncle's marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation but you are no such man you are rather point device in your accouterments as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other me believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his love his mistress and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this color would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart that there shall not be one spot of love in 't i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me go with me to it and i'll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live will you go nay you must call me rosalind come sister will you go never talk to me i will weep but have i not cause to weep his very hair is of the dissembling color i' faith his hair is of a good color and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not do you think so not true in love you have heard him swear downright he was i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him he asked me of what parentage i was i told him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando o come let us remove the sight of lovers feedeth those in love bring us to this sight and you shall say i'll prove a busy actor in their play and why i pray you who might be your mother that you insult exult and all at once over the wretched what though you have no beauty  as by my faith i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed  must you be therefore proud and pitiless why what means this why do you look on me i see no more in you than in the ordinary of nature's sale work 'od's my little life i think she means to tangle my eyes too  no faith proud mistress hope not after it 'tis not your inky brows your black silk hair your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream that can entame my spirits to your worship  you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her like foggy south puffing with wind and rain you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman 'tis such fools as you that makes the world full of ill favored children 'tis not her glass but you that flatters her and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her  but mistress know yourself down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good man's love for i must tell you friendly in your ear sell when you can you are not for all markets cry the man mercy love him take his offer foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer  so take her to thee shepherd fare you well he's fall'n in love with your foulness and she'll fall in love with my anger if it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks i'll sauce her with bitter words why look you so upon me i pray you do not fall in love with me for i am falser than vows made in wine besides i like you not if you will know my house 'tis at the tuft of olives here hard by  will you go sister shepherd ply her hard  come sister shepherdess look on him better and be not proud though all the world could see none could be so abused in sight as he  come to our flock they say you are a melancholy fellow those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards why then 'tis good to be a post a traveller by my faith you have great reason to be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide god for making you that countenance you are or i will scarce think you have swam in a gondola why how now orlando where have you been all this while you a lover an you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more break an hour's promise in love he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid hath clapped him o' th' shoulder but i'll warrant him heart whole nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight i had as lief be wooed of a snail ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head a better jointure i think than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with him why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife and i am your rosalind come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday humor and like enough to consent what would you say to me now an i were your very very rosalind nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking god warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter marry that should you if i were your mistress or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit am not i your rosalind well in her person i say i will not have you no faith die by attorney the poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a love cause troilus had his brains dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love leander he would have lived many a fair year though hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was hero of sestos but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now i will be your rosalind in a more coming on disposition and ask me what you will i will grant it yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all ay and twenty such are you not good why then can one desire too much of a good thing come sister you shall be the priest and marry us give me your hand orlando what do you say sister you must begin will you orlando  ay but when then you must say i take thee rosalind for wife i might ask you for your commission but i do take thee orlando for my husband there's a girl goes before the priest and certainly a woman's thought runs before her actions now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her say a day without the ever no no orlando men are april when they woo december when they wed maids are may when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock pigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyena and that when thou art inclined to sleep by my life she will do as i do or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a woman's wit and it will out at the casement shut that and 'twill out at the keyhole stop that 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbor's bed marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue o that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and i thought no less that flattering tongue of yours won me 'tis but one cast away and so come death two o'clock is your hour by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour i will think you the most pathetical break promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep your promise well time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try adieu o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love but it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of portugal no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone's eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep i am in love i'll tell thee aliena i cannot be out of the sight of orlando i'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come how say you now is it not past two o'clock and here much orlando patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer bear this bear all she says i am not fair that i lack manners she calls me proud and that she could not love me were man as rare as phoenix 'od's my will her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me well shepherd well this is a letter of your own device come come you are a fool and turned into the extremity of love i saw her hand she has a leathern hand a freestone colored hand i verily did think that her old gloves were on but 'twas her hands she has a huswife's hand but that's no matter i say she never did invent this letter this is a man's invention and his hand why 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style a style for challengers why she defies me like turk to christian women's gentle brain could not drop forth such giant rude invention such ethiop words blacker in their effect than in their countenance will you hear the letter she phoebes me mark how the tyrant writes art thou god to shepherd turned that a maiden's heart hath burned can a woman rail thus why thy godhead laid apart warr'st thou with a woman's heart did you ever hear such railing whiles the eye of man did woo me that could do no vengeance to me meaning me a beast if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine alack in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect whiles you chid me i did love how then might your prayers move he that brings this love to thee little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make or else by him my love deny and then i'll study how to die do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt thou love such a woman what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee not to be endured well go your way to her for i see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her that if she love me i charge her to love thee if she will not i will never have her unless thou entreat for her if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company i am what must we understand by this but to orlando did he leave him there food to the sucked and hungry lioness was 't you he rescued but for the bloody napkin i would i were at home i do so i confess it ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited i pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited heigh ho counterfeit i assure you so i do but i' faith i should have been a woman by right i shall devise something but i pray you commend my counterfeiting to him will you go god save you brother o my dear orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkercher o i know where you are nay 'tis true there was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesar's thrasonical brag of i came saw and overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked no sooner looked but they loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage they are in the very wrath of love and they will together clubs cannot part them why then tomorrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind i will weary you then no longer with idle talking know of me then for now i speak to some purpose that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch i say i know you are neither do i labor for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me believe then if you please that i can do strange things i have since i was three year old conversed with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her i know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger by my life i do which i tender dearly though i say i am a magician therefore put you in your best array bid your friends for if you will be married tomorrow you shall and to rosalind if you will look here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers i care not if i have it is my study to seem despiteful and ungentle to you you are there followed by a faithful shepherd look upon him love him he worships you and i for no woman and i for no woman and so am i for no woman why do you speak too why blame you me to love you pray you no more of this 'tis like the howling of irish wolves against the moon i will help you if i can i would love you if i could tomorrow meet me all together i will marry you if ever i marry woman and i'll be married tomorrow i will satisfy you if ever i satisfy man and you shall be married tomorrow i will content you if what pleases you contents you and you shall be married tomorrow as you love rosalind meet as you love phoebe meet and as i love no woman i'll meet so fare you well i have left you commands patience once more whiles our compact is urged you say if i bring in your rosalind you will bestow her on orlando here and you say you will have her when i bring her you say you'll marry me if i be willing but if you do refuse to marry me you'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd you say that you'll have phoebe if she will i have promised to make all this matter even keep you your word o duke to give your daughter  you yours orlando to receive his daughter  keep you your word phoebe that you'll marry me or else refusing me to wed this shepherd  keep your word silvius that you'll marry her if she refuse me and from hence i go to make these doubts all even to you i give myself for i am yours to you i give myself for i am yours i'll have no father if you be not he i'll have no husband if you be not he nor ne'er wed woman if you be not she it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue if it be true that good wine needs no bush 'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues what a case am i in then that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play i am not furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me my way is to conjure you and i'll begin with the women i charge you o women for the love you bear to men to like as much of this play as please you and i charge you o men for the love you bear to women as i perceive by your simpering none of you hates them that between you and the women the play may please if i were a woman i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me complexions that liked me and breaths that i defied not and i am sure as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when i make curtsy bid me farewell
