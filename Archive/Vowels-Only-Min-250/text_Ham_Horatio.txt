friends to this ground a piece of him what has this thing appeared again tonight tush tush 'twill not appear well sit we down and let us hear barnardo speak of this most like it harrows me with fear and wonder what art thou that usurp'st this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak stay speak speak i charge thee speak before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes as thou art to thyself such was the very armor he had on when he the ambitious norway combated so frowned he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice 'tis strange in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of mine opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appeared to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride dared to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteemed him did slay this fortinbras who by a sealed compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seized of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gagèd by our king which had returned to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same comart and carriage of the article designed his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimprovèd mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there sharked up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in 't which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this posthaste and rummage in the land a mote it is to trouble the mind's eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune's empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of feared events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen but soft behold lo where it comes again i'll cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country's fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellus do if it will not stand 'tis here and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th' extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty hail to your lordship the same my lord and your poor servant ever a truant disposition good my lord my lord i came to see your father's funeral indeed my lord it followed hard upon where my lord i saw him once he was a goodly king my lord i think i saw him yesternight my lord the king your father season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encountered a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap à pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walked by their oppressed and fear surprisèd eyes within his truncheon's length whilst they distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had delivered both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up its head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanished from our sight as i do live my honored lord 'tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it we do my lord armed my lord my lord from head to foot o yes my lord he wore his beaver up a countenance more in sorrow than in anger nay very pale most constantly it would have much amazed you while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred not when i saw 't it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silvered i warrant it will our duty to your honor it is a nipping and an eager air i think it lacks of twelve indeed i heard it not it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk what does this mean my lord is it a custom look my lord it comes it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone no by no means do not my lord what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles o'er his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath be ruled you shall not go he waxes desperate with imagination have after to what issue will this come heaven will direct it my lord my lord heavens secure him what news my lord good my lord tell it not i my lord by heaven ay by heaven my lord there needs no ghost my lord come from the grave to tell us this these are but wild and whirling words my lord there's no offense my lord what is 't my lord we will my lord we will not in faith my lord not i propose the oath my lord o day and night but this is wondrous strange here sweet lord at your service o my dear lord  well my lord if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing and 'scape detecting i will pay the theft half a share you might have rhymed very well my lord i did very well note him 'twere good she were spoken with for she may strew dangerous conjectures in ill breeding minds what are they that would speak with me let them come in i do not know from what part of the world i should be greeted if not from lord hamlet let him bless thee too horatio when thou shalt have overlooked this give these fellows some means to the king they have letters for him ere we were two days old at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on a compelled valor and in the grapple i boarded them on the instant they got clear of our ship so i alone became their prisoner they have dealt with me like thieves of mercy but they knew what they did i am to do a good turn for them let the king have the letters i have sent and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death i have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter these good fellows will bring thee where i am rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their course for england of them i have much to tell thee farewell he that thou knowest thine hamlet come i will give you way for these your letters and do 't the speedier that you may direct me to him from whom you brought them custom hath made it in him a property of easiness it might my lord ay my lord not a jot more my lord ay my lord and of calves' skins too what's that my lord e'en so e'en so my lord 'twere to consider too curiously to consider so good my lord be quiet remember it my lord that is most certain is 't possible i beseech you ay good my lord how was this sealed so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to 't why what a king is this it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there peace who comes here no my good lord is 't not possible to understand in another tongue you will to 't sir really his purse is empty already all 's golden words are spent i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head you will lose my lord nay good my lord  if your mind dislike anything obey it i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit they bleed on both sides how is it my lord never believe it i am more an antique roman than a dane here's yet some liquor left now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest why does the drum come hither what is it you would see if aught of woe or wonder cease your search not from his mouth had it th' ability of life to thank you he never gave commandment for their death but since so jump upon this bloody question you from the polack wars and you from england are here arrived give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view and let me speak to th' yet unknowing world how these things came about so shall you hear of carnal bloody and unnatural acts of accidental judgments casual slaughters of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause and in this upshot purposes mistook fall'n on th' inventors' heads all this can i truly deliver of that i shall have also cause to speak and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more but let this same be presently performed even while men's minds are wild lest more mischance on plots and errors happen
