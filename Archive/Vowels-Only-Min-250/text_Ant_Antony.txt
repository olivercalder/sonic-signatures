what worst when it concerns the fool or coward on things that are past are done with me 'tis thus who tells me true though in his tale lie death i hear him as he flattered antony thou wouldst say

queen break off ten thousand harms more than the ills i know my idleness doth hatch how now enobarbus i must with haste from hence i must be gone she is cunning past man's thought would i had never seen her fulvia is dead fulvia is dead dead the business she hath broach√®d in the state cannot endure my absence no more light answers let our officers have notice what we purpose i shall break the cause of our expedience to the queen and get her leave to part for not alone the death of fulvia with more urgent touches do strongly speak to us but the letters too of many our contriving friends in rome petition us at home sextus pompeius hath given the dare to caesar and commands the empire of the sea our slippery people whose love is never linked to the deserver till his deserts are past begin to throw pompey the great and all his dignities upon his son who high in name and power higher than both in blood and life stands up for the main soldier whose quality going on the sides o' th' world may danger much is breeding which like the courser's hair hath yet but life and not a serpent's poison say our pleasure to such whose place is under us requires our quick remove from hence i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose  now my dearest queen  what's the matter the gods best know  cleopatra  most sweet queen  how now lady hear me queen the strong necessity of time commands our services awhile but my full heart remains in use with you our italy shines o'er with civil swords sextus pompeius makes his approaches to the port of rome equality of two domestic powers breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength are newly grown to love the condemned pompey rich in his father's honor creeps apace into the hearts of such as have not thrived upon the present state whose numbers threaten and quietness grown sick of rest would purge by any desperate change my more particular and that which most with you should safe my going is fulvia's death she's dead my queen look here and at thy sovereign leisure read the garboils she awaked at the last best see when and where she died quarrel no more but be prepared to know the purposes i bear which are or cease as you shall give th' advice by the fire that quickens nilus' slime i go from hence thy soldier servant making peace or war as thou affects my precious queen forbear and give true evidence to his love which stands an honorable trial you'll heat my blood no more now by my sword  i'll leave you lady but that your royalty holds idleness your subject i should take you for idleness itself let us go come our separation so abides and flies that thou residing here goes yet with me and i hence fleeting here remain with thee away if we compose well here to parthia hark ventidius 'tis spoken well were we before our armies and to fight i should do thus thank you sit sir i learn you take things ill which are not so or being concern you not my being in egypt caesar what was 't to you how intend you practiced you do mistake your business my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause of this my letters before did satisfy you if you'll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have to make it with it must not be with this not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain on 't  very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another the third o' th' world is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife so much uncurbable her garboils caesar made out of her impatience which not wanted shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant did you too much disquiet for that you must but say i could not help it sir he fell upon me ere admitted then three kings i had newly feasted and did want of what i was i' th' morning but next day i told him of myself which was as much as to have asked him pardon let this fellow be nothing of our strife if we contend out of our question wipe him no lepidus let him speak the honor is sacred which he talks on now supposing that i lacked it but on caesar the article of my oath neglected rather and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge as nearly as i may i'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness nor my power work without it truth is that fulvia to have me out of egypt made wars here for which myself the ignorant motive do so far ask pardon as befits mine honor to stoop in such a case thou art a soldier only speak no more you wrong this presence therefore speak no more i am not married caesar let me hear agrippa further speak will caesar speak what power is in agrippa if i would say agrippa be it so to make this good may i never to this good purpose that so fairly shows dream of impediment let me have thy hand further this act of grace and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs i did not think to draw my sword 'gainst pompey for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me i must thank him only lest my remembrance suffer ill report at heel of that defy him where lies he what is his strength by land so is the fame would we had spoke together haste we for it yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we the business we have talked of let us lepidus not lack your company the world and my great office will sometimes divide me from your bosom goodnight sir my octavia read not my blemishes in the world's report i have not kept my square but that to come shall all be done by th' rule good night dear lady  good night sir now sirrah you do wish yourself in egypt if you can your reason say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher caesar's or mine speak this no more get thee gone say to ventidius i would speak with him he shall to parthia be it art or hap he hath spoken true the very dice obey him and in our sports my better cunning faints under his chance if we draw lots he speeds his cocks do win the battle still of mine when it is all to naught and his quails ever beat mine inhooped at odds i will to egypt and though i make this marriage for my peace i' th' east my pleasure lies o come ventidius you must to parthia your commission's ready follow me and receive 't thou canst not fear us pompey with thy sails we'll speak with thee at sea at land thou know'st how much we do o'ercount thee which do not be entreated to but weigh what it is worth embraced that's our offer i have heard it pompey and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you the beds i' th' east are soft and thanks to you that called me timelier than my purpose hither for i have gained by 't that will i pompey you have heard much and fair words to them show 's the way sir thus do they sir they take the flow o' th' nile by certain scales i' th' pyramid they know by th' height the lowness or the mean if dearth or foison follow the higher nilus swells the more it promises as it ebbs the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain and shortly comes to harvest ay lepidus they are so it is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is and moves with it own organs it lives by that which nourisheth it and the elements once out of it it transmigrates of it own color too 'tis so and the tears of it are wet with the health that pompey gives him else he is a very epicure these quicksands lepidus keep off them for you sink bear him ashore i'll pledge it for him pompey it ripens towards it strike the vessels ho here's to caesar be a child o' th' time come let's all take hands till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense in soft and delicate lethe cup us till the world go round cup us till the world go round and shall sir give 's your hand no further sir make me not offended in your distrust you shall not find though you be therein curious the least cause for what you seem to fear so the gods keep you and make the hearts of romans serve your ends we will here part the april's in her eyes it is love's spring and these the showers to bring it on be cheerful her tongue will not obey her heart nor can her heart inform her tongue the swan's down feather that stands upon the swell at the full of tide and neither way inclines come sir come i'll wrestle with you in my strength of love look here i have you thus i let you go and give you to the gods farewell nay nay octavia not only that  that were excusable that and thousands more of semblable import but he hath waged new wars 'gainst pompey made his will and read it to public ear spoke scantly of me when perforce he could not but pay me terms of honor cold and sickly he vented them most narrow measure lent me when the best hint was given him he not took 't or did it from his teeth gentle octavia let your best love draw to that point which seeks best to preserve it if i lose mine honor i lose myself better i were not yours than yours so branchless but as you requested yourself shall go between 's the meantime lady i'll raise the preparation of a war shall stain your brother make your soonest haste so your desires are yours when it appears to you where this begins turn your displeasure that way for our faults can never be so equal that your love can equally move with them provide your going choose your own company and command what cost your heart has mind to is it not strange canidius that from tarentum and brundusium he could so quickly cut the ionian sea and take in toryne you have heard on 't sweet a good rebuke which might have well becomed the best of men to taunt at slackness canidius we will fight with him by sea for that he dares us to 't by sea by sea i'll fight at sea our overplus of shipping will we burn and with the rest full manned from th' head of actium beat th' approaching caesar but if we fail we then can do 't at land thy business can he be there in person 'tis impossible strange that his power should be canidius our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land and our twelve thousand horse we'll to our ship  away my thetis how now worthy soldier well well away set we our squadrons on yond side o' th' hill in eye of caesar's battle from which place we may the number of the ships behold and so proceed accordingly hark the land bids me

harbor take it o i followed that i blush to look upon my very hairs do mutiny for the white reprove the brown for rashness and they them for fear and doting friends begone you shall have letters from me to some friends that will sweep your way for you pray you look not sad nor make replies of loathness take the hint which my despair proclaims let that be left which leaves itself to the seaside

practice had in the brave squares of war yet now no matter i have offended reputation a most unnoble swerving o whither hast them led me egypt see how i convey my shame out of thine eyes by looking back what i have left behind 'stroyed in dishonor egypt thou knew'st too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings and thou shouldst tow me after o'er my spirit thy full supremacy thou knew'st and that thy beck might from the bidding of the gods command me now i must to the young man send humble treaties dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness who with half the bulk o' th' world played as i pleased making and marring fortunes you did know how much you were my conqueror and that my sword made weak by my affection would obey it on all cause fall not a tear i say one of them rates all that is won and lost give me a kiss even this repays me  we sent our schoolmaster is he come back  love i am full of lead some wine within there and our viands fortune knows we scorn her most when most she offers blows is that his answer the queen shall then have courtesy so she will yield us up let her know 't  to the boy caesar send this grizzled head and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities to him again tell him he wears the rose of youth upon him from which the world should note something particular his coin ships legions may be a coward's whose ministers would prevail under the service of a child as soon as i' th' command of caesar i dare him therefore to lay his gay caparisons apart and answer me declined sword against sword ourselves alone i'll write it follow me favors by jove that thunders what art thou fellow approach there ah you kite now gods and devils authority melts from me of late when i cried ho like boys unto a muss kings would start forth and cry your will have you no ears i am antony yet take hence this jack and whip him moon and stars whip him were 't twenty of the greatest tributaries that do acknowledge caesar should i find them so saucy with the hand of she here what's her name since she was cleopatra whip him fellows till like a boy you see him cringe his face and whine aloud for mercy take him hence tug him away being whipped bring him again this jack of caesar's shall bear us an errand to him you were half blasted ere i knew you ha have i my pillow left unpressed in rome forborne the getting of a lawful race

our clear judgments make us adore our errors laugh at 's while we strut to our confusion i found you as a morsel cold upon dead caesar's trencher nay you were a fragment of gneius pompey's besides what hotter hours unregistered in vulgar fame you have luxuriously picked out for i am sure though you can guess what temperance should be you know not what it is to let a fellow that will take rewards and say god quit you be familiar with my playfellow your hand this kingly seal and plighter of high hearts o that i were upon the hill of basan to outroar the horn√®d herd for i have savage cause and to proclaim it civilly were like a haltered neck which does the hangman thank for being yare about him is he whipped cried he and begged he pardon if that thy father live let him repent thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry to follow caesar in his triumph since thou hast been whipped for following him henceforth the white hand of a lady fever thee shake thou to look on 't get thee back to caesar tell him thy entertainment look thou say he makes me angry with him for he seems proud and disdainful harping on what i am not what he knew i was he makes me angry and at this time most easy 'tis to do 't when my good stars that were my former guides have empty left their orbs and shot their fires into th' abysm of hell if he mislike my speech and what is done tell him he has hipparchus my enfranch√®d bondman whom he may at pleasure whip or hang or torture as he shall like to quit me urge it thou hence with thy stripes begone alack our terrene moon is now eclipsed and it portends alone the fall of antony to flatter caesar would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points coldhearted toward me i am satisfied caesar sits down in alexandria where i will oppose his fate
