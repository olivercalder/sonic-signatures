was ever man so proud as is this martius when we were chosen tribunes for the people  nay but his taunts bemock the modest moon such a nature tickled with good success disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon but i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under cominius besides if things go well opinion that so sticks on martius shall of his demerits rob cominius let's hence and hear how the dispatch is made and in what fashion more than his singularity he goes upon this present action nature teaches beasts to know their friends the lamb well sir especially in pride why how are we censured well well sir well what then sir menenius you are known well enough too on the sudden i warrant him consul he cannot temp'rately transport his honors from where he should begin and end but will lose those he hath won doubt not the commoners for whom we stand but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honors which that he will give them make i as little question as he is proud to do 't 'tis right i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution it shall be to him then as our good wills a sure destruction this as you say suggested at some time when his soaring insolence shall touch the people which time shall not want if he be put upon 't and that's as easy as to set dogs on sheep will be his fire to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze shall darken him forever have with you we are convented upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts inclinable to honor and advance the theme of our assembly sir the people must have their voices neither will they bate one jot of ceremony may they perceive 's intent he will require them as if he did contemn what he requested should be in them to give the custom of request you have discharged the people do admit you and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation there coriolanus you may sir fare you well he has it now and by his looks methinks 'tis warm at 's heart how now my masters have you chose this man why so he did i am sure why either were you ignorant to see 't or seeing it of such childish friendliness to yield your voices thus to have said as you were fore advised had touched his spirit and tried his inclination from him plucked either his gracious promise which you might as cause had called you up have held him to or else it would have galled his surly nature which easily endures not article tying him to aught so putting him to rage you should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler and passed him unelected have you ere now denied the asker and now again of him that did not ask but mock bestow your sued for tongues let them assemble and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election enforce his pride and his old hate unto you besides forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed how in his suit he scorned you but your loves thinking upon his services took from you th' apprehension of his present portance which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion after the inveterate hate he bears you say you chose him more after our commandment than as guided by your own true affections and that your minds preoccupied with what you rather must do than what you should made you against the grain to voice him consul lay the fault on us one thus descended that hath besides well in his person wrought to be set high in place we did commend to your remembrances but you have found scaling his present bearing with his past that he's your fixèd enemy and revoke your sudden approbation to th' capitol come we will be there before the stream o' th' people and this shall seem as partly 'tis their own which we have goaded onward pass no further stop or all will fall in broil you show too much of that for which the people stir if you will pass to where you are bound you must inquire your way which you are out of with a gentler spirit or never be so noble as a consul nor yoke with him for tribune 'twere well we let the people know 't it is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is not poison any further 'has spoken like a traitor and shall answer as traitors do this a consul no go call the people in whose name myself attach thee as a traitorous innovator a foe to th' public weal obey i charge thee and follow to thine answer help you citizens here's he that would take from you all your power peace peace peace stay hold peace hear me people peace you are at point to lose your liberties martius would have all from you martius whom late you have named for consul what is the city but the people this deserves death therefore lay hold of him bear him to th' rock tarpeian and from thence into destruction cast him where is this viper that would depopulate the city and be every man himself he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous hands he hath resisted law and therefore law shall scorn him further trial than the severity of the public power which he so sets at naught peace sir how comes 't that you have holp to make this rescue consul what consul speak briefly then for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor to eject him hence were but one danger and to keep him here our certain death therefore it is decreed he dies tonight he's a disease that must be cut away this is clean cam the service of the foot being once gangrened is not then respected for what before it was what do you talk have we not had a taste of his obedience our aediles smote ourselves resisted come noble menenius be you then as the people's officer  masters lay down your weapons meet on the marketplace we'll attend you there where if you bring not martius we'll proceed in our first way have you a catalogue of all the voices that we have procured set down by th' poll have you collected them by tribes assemble presently the people hither and when they hear me say it shall be so i' th' right and strength o' th' commons be it either for death for fine or banishment then let them if i say fine cry fine if death cry death insisting on the old prerogative and power i' th' truth o' th' cause make them be strong and ready for this hint when we shall hap to give 't them well here he comes draw near you people well say peace ho i do demand if you submit you to the people's voices allow their officers and are content to suffer lawful censure for such faults as shall be proved upon you answer to us we charge you that you have contrived to take from rome all seasoned office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical for which you are a traitor to the people mark you this people peace we need not put new matter to his charge what you have seen him do and heard him speak beating your officers cursing yourselves opposing laws with strokes and here defying those whose great power must try him even this so criminal and in such capital kind deserves th' extremest death for that he has as much as in him lies from time to time envied against the people seeking means to pluck away their power as now at last given hostile strokes and that not in the presence of dreaded justice but on the ministers that doth distribute it in the name o' th' people and in the power of us the tribunes we even from this instant banish him our city in peril of precipitation from off the rock tarpeian never more to enter our rome gates i' th' people's name i say it shall be so he's sentenced no more hearing we know your drift speak what go see him out at gates and follow him as he hath followed you with all despite give him deserved vexation let a guard attend us through the city bid them all home he's gone and we'll no further the nobility are vexed whom we see have sided in his behalf bid them home say their great enemy is gone and they stand in their ancient strength let's not meet her they say she's mad are you mankind o blessèd heavens what then i would he had continued to his country as he began and not unknit himself the noble knot he made why stay we to be baited with one that wants her wits we hear not of him neither need we fear him his remedies are tame the present peace and quietness of the people which before were in wild hurry here do we make his friends blush that the world goes well who rather had though they themselves did suffer by 't behold dissentious numbers pest'ring streets than see our tradesmen singing in their shops and going about their functions friendly 'tis he 'tis he o he is grown most kind of late hail sir your coriolanus is not much missed but with his friends the commonwealth doth stand and so would do were he more angry at it where is he hear you good e'en our neighbors live and thrive farewell farewell this is a happier and more comely time than when these fellows ran about the streets crying confusion and affecting one sole throne without assistance we should by this to all our lamentation if he had gone forth consul found it so come what talk you of martius tell not me i know this cannot be 'tis this slave  go whip him 'fore the people's eyes his raising nothing but his report what more fearful this is most likely the very trick on 't say not we brought it go masters get you home be not dismayed these are a side that would be glad to have this true which they so seem to fear go home and show no sign of fear nor i pray let's go nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid in this so never needed help yet do not upbraid 's with our distress but sure if you would be your country's pleader your good tongue more than the instant army we can make might stop our countryman pray you go to him yet your good will must have that thanks from rome after the measure as you intended well not why what of that is 't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man he loved his mother dearly yes mercy if you report him truly the gods be good unto us what's the news friend art thou certain this is true is 't most certain first the gods bless you for your tidings next accept my thankfulness they are near the city we'll meet them and help the joy
