set down set down your honorable load if honor may be shrouded in a hearse whilst i awhile obsequiously lament th' untimely fall of virtuous lancaster poor key cold figure of a holy king pale ashes of the house of lancaster thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost to hear the lamentations of poor anne wife to thy edward to thy slaughtered son stabbed by the selfsame hand that made these wounds lo in these windows that let forth thy life i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes o cursèd be the hand that made these holes cursèd the heart that had the heart to do it cursèd the blood that let this blood from hence more direful hap betide that hated wretch that makes us wretched by the death of thee than i can wish to wolves to spiders toads or any creeping venomed thing that lives if ever he have child abortive be it prodigious and untimely brought to light whose ugly and unnatural aspect may fright the hopeful mother at the view and that be heir to his unhappiness if ever he have wife let her be made more miserable by the death of him than i am made by my young lord and thee  come now towards chertsey with your holy load taken from paul's to be interrèd there and still as you are weary of this weight rest you whiles i lament king henry's corse what black magician conjures up this fiend to stop devoted charitable deeds what do you tremble are you all afraid alas i blame you not for you are mortal and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil  avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell thou hadst but power over his mortal body his soul thou canst not have therefore begone foul devil for god's sake hence and trouble us not for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell filled it with cursing cries and deep exclaims if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds behold this pattern of thy butcheries o gentlemen see see dead henry's wounds open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh  blush blush thou lump of foul deformity for 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells thy deeds inhuman and unnatural provokes this deluge most unnatural  o god which this blood mad'st revenge his death o earth which this blood drink'st revenge his death either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead or earth gape open wide and eat him quick as thou dost swallow up this good king's blood which his hell governed arm hath butcherèd villain thou know'st nor law of god nor man no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity o wonderful when devils tell the truth vouchsafe defused infection of a man of these known evils but to give me leave by circumstance to curse thy cursèd self fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself and by despairing shalt thou stand excused for doing worthy vengeance on thyself that didst unworthy slaughter upon others then say they were not slain but dead they are and devilish slave by thee why then he is alive in thy foul throat thou liest queen margaret saw thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood the which thou once didst bend against her breast but that thy brothers beat aside the point thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind that never dream'st on aught but butcheries didst thou not kill this king dost grant me hedgehog then god grant me too thou mayst be damnèd for that wicked deed o he was gentle mild and virtuous he is in heaven where thou shalt never come and thou unfit for any place but hell some dungeon ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest i hope so thou wast the cause and most accursed effect if i thought that i tell thee homicide these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life i would i were to be revenged on thee it is a quarrel just and reasonable to be revenged on him that killed my husband his better doth not breathe upon the earth name him why that was he where is he would it were mortal poison for thy sake never hung poison on a fouler toad out of my sight thou dost infect mine eyes would they were basilisks' to strike thee dead arise dissembler though i wish thy death i will not be thy executioner i have already i would i knew thy heart i fear me both are false well well put up your sword that shalt thou know hereafter all men i hope live so to take is not to give what is it with all my heart and much it joys me too to see you are become so penitent  tressel and berkeley go along with me 'tis more than you deserve but since you teach me how to flatter you imagine i have said farewell already god give your graces both a happy and a joyful time of day no farther than the tower and as i guess upon the like devotion as yourselves to gratulate the gentle princes there their aunt i am in law in love their mother then bring me to their sights i'll bear thy blame and take thy office from thee on my peril despiteful tidings o unpleasing news and i with all unwillingness will go o would to god that the inclusive verge of golden metal that must round my brow were red hot steel to sear me to the brains anointed let me be with deadly venom and die ere men can say god save the queen no why when he that is my husband now came to me as i followed henry's corse when scarce the blood was well washed from his hands which issued from my other angel husband and that dear saint which then i weeping followed  o when i say i looked on richard's face this was my wish be thou quoth i accursed for making me so young so old a widow and when thou wedd'st let sorrow haunt thy bed and be thy wife if any be so mad more miserable by the life of thee than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death lo ere i can repeat this curse again within so small a time my woman's heart grossly grew captive to his honey words and proved the subject of mine own soul's curse which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest for never yet one hour in his bed did i enjoy the golden dew of sleep but with his timorous dreams was still awaked besides he hates me for my father warwick and will no doubt shortly be rid of me no more than with my soul i mourn for yours adieu poor soul that tak'st thy leave of it richard thy wife that wretched anne thy wife that never slept a quiet hour with thee now fills thy sleep with perturbations tomorrow in the battle think on me and fall thy edgeless sword despair and die thou quiet soul sleep thou a quiet sleep dream of success and happy victory thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee
