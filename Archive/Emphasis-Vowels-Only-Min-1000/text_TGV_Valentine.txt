cease to persuade my loving proteus home keeping youth have ever homely wits were 't not affection chains thy tender days to the sweet glances of thy honored love i rather would entreat thy company to see the wonders of the world abroad than living dully sluggardized at home wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness but since thou lov'st love still and thrive therein even as i would when i to love begin and on a love book pray for my success that's on some shallow story of deep love how young leander crossed the hellespont 'tis true for you are over boots in love and yet you never swam the hellespont no i will not for it boots thee not to be in love where scorn is bought with groans coy looks with heart sore sighs one fading moment's mirth with twenty watchful weary tedious nights if haply won perhaps a hapless gain if lost why then a grievous labor won how ever but a folly bought with wit or else a wit by folly vanquishèd so by your circumstance i fear you'll prove love is your master for he masters you and he that is so yokèd by a fool methinks should not be chronicled for wise and writers say as the most forward bud is eaten by the canker ere it blow even so by love the young and tender wit is turned to folly blasting in the bud losing his verdure even in the prime and all the fair effects of future hopes but wherefore waste i time to counsel thee that art a votary to fond desire once more adieu my father at the road expects my coming there to see me shipped sweet proteus no now let us take our leave to milan let me hear from thee by letters of thy success in love and what news else betideth here in absence of thy friend and i likewise will visit thee with mine as much to you at home and so farewell not mine my gloves are on ha let me see ay give it me

and spends what he borrows kindly in your company i know it well sir you have an exchequer of words and i think no other treasure to give your followers for it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words my lord i will be thankful to any happy messenger from thence ay my good lord i know the gentleman to be of worth and worthy estimation and not without desert so well reputed ay my good lord a son that well deserves the honor and regard of such a father i knew him as myself for from our infancy we have conversed and spent our hours together and though myself have been an idle truant omitting the sweet benefit of time to clothe mine age with angel like perfection yet hath sir proteus for that's his name  made use and fair advantage of his days his years but young but his experience old his head unmellowed but his judgment ripe and in a word for far behind his worth comes all the praises that i now bestow  he is complete in feature and in mind with all good grace to grace a gentleman should i have wished a thing it had been he this is the gentleman i told your ladyship had come along with me but that his mistress did hold his eyes locked in her crystal looks nay sure i think she holds them prisoners still why lady love hath twenty pair of eyes to see such lovers thurio as yourself upon a homely object love can wink welcome dear proteus mistress i beseech you confirm his welcome with some special favor mistress it is sweet lady entertain him to be my fellow servant to your ladyship leave off discourse of disability sweet lady entertain him for your servant now tell me how do all from whence you came and how do yours how does your lady and how thrives your love ay proteus but that life is altered now i have done penance for contemning love whose high imperious thoughts have punished me with bitter fasts with penitential groans with nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs for in revenge of my contempt of love love hath chased sleep from my enthrallèd eyes and made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow o gentle proteus love's a mighty lord and hath so humbled me as i confess there is no woe to his correction nor to his service no such joy on earth now no discourse except it be of love now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep upon the very naked name of love even she and is she not a heavenly saint call her divine o flatter me for love delights in praises then speak the truth by her if not divine yet let her be a principality sovereign to all the creatures on the earth sweet except not any except thou wilt except against my love and i will help thee to prefer her too she shall be dignified with this high honor  to bear my lady's train lest the base earth should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss and of so great a favor growing proud disdain to root the summer swelling flower and make rough winter everlastingly pardon me proteus all i can is nothing to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing she is alone  not for the world why man she is mine own and i as rich in having such a jewel as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl the water nectar and the rocks pure gold forgive me that i do not dream on thee because thou seest me dote upon my love my foolish rival that her father likes only for his possessions are so huge is gone with her along and i must after for love thou know'st is full of jealousy ay and we are betrothed nay more our marriage hour with all the cunning manner of our flight determined of how i must climb her window the ladder made of cords and all the means plotted and 'greed on for my happiness good proteus go with me to my chamber in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel will you make haste please it your grace there is a messenger that stays to bear my letters to my friends and i am going to deliver them the tenor of them doth but signify my health and happy being at your court i know it well my lord and sure the match were rich and honorable besides the gentleman is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter cannot your grace win her to fancy him what would your grace have me to do in this win her with gifts if she respect not words dumb jewels often in their silent kind more than quick words do move a woman's mind a woman sometime scorns what best contents her send her another never give her o'er for scorn at first makes after love the more if she do frown 'tis not in hate of you but rather to beget more love in you if she do chide 'tis not to have you gone forwhy the fools are mad if left alone take no repulse whatever she doth say for get you gone she doth not mean away flatter and praise commend extol their graces though ne'er so black say they have angels' faces that man that hath a tongue i say is no man if with his tongue he cannot win a woman why then i would resort to her by night what lets but one may enter at her window why then a ladder quaintly made of cords to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks would serve to scale another hero's tower so bold leander would adventure it when would you use it pray sir tell me that by seven o'clock i'll get you such a ladder it will be light my lord that you may bear it under a cloak that is of any length ay my good lord why any cloak will serve the turn my lord and why not death rather than living torment to die is to be banished from myself and sylvia is myself banished from her is self from self a deadly banishment what light is light if sylvia be not seen what joy is joy if sylvia be not by  unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection except i be by sylvia in the night there is no music in the nightingale unless i look on sylvia in the day there is no day for me to look upon she is my essence and i leave to be if i be not by her fair influence fostered illumined cherished kept alive i fly not death to fly his deadly doom tarry i here i but attend on death but fly i hence i fly away from life no neither nothing my ears are stopped and cannot hear good news so much of bad already hath possessed them is sylvia dead no valentine indeed for sacred sylvia hath she forsworn me no valentine if sylvia have forsworn me what is your news o i have fed upon this woe already and now excess of it will make me surfeit doth sylvia know that i am banishèd no more unless the next word that thou speak'st have some malignant power upon my life if so i pray thee breathe it in mine ear as ending anthem of my endless dolor i pray thee lance an if thou seest my boy bid him make haste and meet me at the north gate o my dear sylvia hapless valentine my friends  then know that i have little wealth to lose a man i am crossed with adversity my riches are these poor habiliments of which if you should here disfurnish me you take the sum and substance that i have to verona from milan some sixteen months and longer might have stayed if crooked fortune had not thwarted me i was for that which now torments me to rehearse i killed a man whose death i much repent but yet i slew him manfully in fight without false vantage or base treachery i was and held me glad of such a doom my youthful travel therein made me happy or else i often had been miserable peace villain nothing but my fortune i take your offer and will live with you provided that you do no outrages on silly women or poor passengers how use doth breed a habit in a man this shadowy desert unfrequented woods i better brook than flourishing peopled towns here can i sit alone unseen of any and to the nightingale's complaining notes tune my distresses and record my woes o thou that dost inhabit in my breast leave not the mansion so long tenantless lest growing ruinous the building fall and leave no memory of what it was repair me with thy presence sylvia thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain what hallowing and what stir is this today these are my mates that make their wills their law have some unhappy passenger in chase they love me well yet i have much to do to keep them from uncivil outrages withdraw thee valentine who's this comes here how like a dream is this i see and hear love lend me patience to forbear awhile ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch thou friend of an ill fashion thou common friend that's without faith or love for such is a friend now treacherous man thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye could have persuaded me now i dare not say i have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me who should be trusted when one's right hand is perjured to the bosom proteus i am sorry i must never trust thee more but count the world a stranger for thy sake the private wound is deepest o time most accursed 'mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst then i am paid and once again i do receive thee honest who by repentance is not satisfied is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased by penitence th' eternal's wrath's appeased and that my love may appear plain and free all that was mine in sylvia i give thee why boy why wag how now what's the matter look up speak come come a hand from either let me be blest to make this happy close 'twere pity two such friends should be long foes forbear forbear i say it is my lord the duke your grace is welcome to a man disgraced banished valentine thurio give back or else embrace thy death come not within the measure of my wrath do not name sylvia thine if once again verona shall not hold thee here she stands take but possession of her with a touch  i dare thee but to breathe upon my love i thank your grace the gift hath made me happy i now beseech you for your daughter's sake to grant one boon that i shall ask of you these banished men that i have kept withal are men endued with worthy qualities forgive them what they have committed here and let them be recalled from their exile they are reformèd civil full of good and fit for great employment worthy lord and as we walk along i dare be bold with our discourse to make your grace to smile what think you of this page my lord i warrant you my lord more grace than boy please you i'll tell you as we pass along that you will wonder what hath fortunèd  come proteus 'tis your penance but to hear the story of your loves discoverèd that done our day of marriage shall be yours one feast one house one mutual happiness
