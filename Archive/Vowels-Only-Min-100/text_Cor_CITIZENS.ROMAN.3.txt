we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members we have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some abram some bald but that our wits are so diversely colored and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o' th' compass nay your wit will not so soon out as another man's will 'tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead but if it were at liberty 'twould sure southward to lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience' sake to help to get thee a wife are you all resolved to give your voices but that's no matter the greater part carries it i say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man here he comes and in the gown of humility mark his behavior we are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes he's to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honor in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me and i'll direct you how you shall go by him we do sir tell us what hath brought you to 't how not your own desire you must think if we give you anything we hope to gain by you but this is something odd certainly he flouted us downright no no no man saw 'em he said he had wounds which he could show in private and with his hat thus waving it in scorn i would be consul says he ag√®d custom but by your voices will not so permit me your voices therefore when we granted that here was i thank you for your voices thank you your most sweet voices now you have left your voices i have no further with you was not this mockery he's not confirmed we may deny him yet we will so almost all repent in their election
