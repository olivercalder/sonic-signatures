good time of day unto my gracious lord with patience noble lord as prisoners must but i shall live my lord to give them thanks that were the cause of my imprisonment more pity that the eagles should be mewed whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty no news so bad abroad as this at home the king is sickly weak and melancholy and his physicians fear him mightily he is o 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe and the most merciless that e'er was heard of false boding woman end thy frantic curse lest to thy harm thou move our patience so thrive i as i truly swear the like so prosper i as i swear perfect love and so swear i and so say i on what occasion god he knows not i the queen your mother and your brother york have taken sanctuary the tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace but by his mother was perforce withheld i go my lord who knocks what is 't o'clock cannot my lord stanley sleep these tedious nights what then go fellow go return unto thy lord bid him not fear the separated council his honor and myself are at the one and at the other is my good friend catesby where nothing can proceed that toucheth us whereof i shall not have intelligence tell him his fears are shallow without instance and for his dreams i wonder he's so simple to trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers to fly the boar before the boar pursues were to incense the boar to follow us and make pursuit where he did mean no chase go bid thy master rise and come to me and we will both together to the tower where he shall see the boar will use us kindly good morrow catesby you are early stirring what news what news in this our tott'ring state how wear the garland dost thou mean the crown i'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders before i'll see the crown so foul misplaced but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it indeed i am no mourner for that news because they have been still my adversaries but that i'll give my voice on richard's side to bar my master's heirs in true descent god knows i will not do it to the death but i shall laugh at this a twelve month hence that they which brought me in my master's hate i live to look upon their tragedy well catesby ere a fortnight make me older i'll send some packing that yet think not on 't o monstrous monstrous and so falls it out with rivers vaughan grey and so 'twill do with some men else that think themselves as safe as thou and i who as thou know'st are dear to princely richard and to buckingham i know they do and i have well deserved it come on come on where is your boar spear man fear you the boar and go so unprovided my lord i hold my life as dear as you do yours and never in my days i do protest was it so precious to me as 'tis now think you but that i know our state secure i would be so triumphant as i am come come have with you wot you what my lord today the lords you talked of are beheaded go on before i'll talk with this good fellow how now sirrah how goes the world with thee i tell thee man 'tis better with me now than when thou met'st me last where now we meet then was i going prisoner to the tower by the suggestion of the queen's allies but now i tell thee keep it to thyself  this day those enemies are put to death and i in better state than e'er i was gramercy fellow there drink that for me i thank thee good sir john with all my heart i am in your debt for your last exercise come the next sabbath and i will content you good faith and when i met this holy man the men you talk of came into my mind what go you toward the tower nay like enough for i stay dinner there i'll wait upon your lordship now noble peers the cause why we are met is to determine of the coronation in god's name speak when is the royal day i thank his grace i know he loves me well but for his purpose in the coronation i have not sounded him nor he delivered his gracious pleasure any way therein but you my honorable lords may name the time and in the duke's behalf i'll give my voice which i presume he'll take in gentle part his grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning there's some conceit or other likes him well when that he bids good morrow with such spirit i think there's never a man in christendom can lesser hide his love or hate than he for by his face straight shall you know his heart marry that with no man here he is offended for were he he had shown it in his looks the tender love i bear your grace my lord makes me most forward in this princely presence to doom th' offenders whosoe'er they be i say my lord they have deserv√®d death if they have done this deed my noble lord  woe woe for england not a whit for me for i too fond might have prevented this stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm and i did scorn it and disdain to fly three times today my foot cloth horse did stumble and started when he looked upon the tower as loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse o now i need the priest that spake to me i now repent i told the pursuivant as too triumphing how mine enemies today at pomfret bloodily were butchered and i myself secure in grace and favor o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor hastings' wretched head o momentary grace of mortal men which we more hunt for than the grace of god who builds his hope in air of your good looks lives like a drunken sailor on a mast ready with every nod to tumble down into the fatal bowels of the deep o bloody richard miserable england i prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee that ever wretched age hath looked upon  come lead me to the block bear him my head they smile at me who shortly shall be dead bloody and guilty guiltily awake and in a bloody battle end thy days think on lord hastings despair and die quiet untroubled soul awake awake arm fight and conquer for fair england's sake
