call you me fair that fair again unsay demetrius loves your fair o happy fair your eyes are lodestars and your tongue's sweet air more tunable than lark to shepherd's ear when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear sickness is catching o were favor so yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye my tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody were the world mine demetrius being bated the rest i'd give to be to you translated o teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius' heart o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill o that my prayers could such affection move the more i love the more he hateth me none but your beauty would that fault were mine how happy some o'er other some can be through athens i am thought as fair as she but what of that demetrius thinks not so he will not know what all but he do know and as he errs doting on hermia's eyes so i admiring of his qualities things base and vile holding no quantity love can transpose to form and dignity love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is winged cupid painted blind nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste and therefore is love said to be a child because in choice he is so oft beguiled as waggish boys in game themselves forswear so the boy love is perjured everywhere for ere demetrius looked on hermia's eyne he hailed down oaths that he was only mine and when this hail some heat from hermia felt so he dissolved and show'rs of oaths did melt i will go tell him of fair hermia's flight then to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her and for this intelligence if i have thanks it is a dear expense but herein mean i to enrich my pain to have his sight thither and back again you draw me you hard hearted adamant but yet you draw not iron for my heart is true as steel leave you your power to draw and i shall have no power to follow you and even for that do i love you the more i am your spaniel and demetrius the more you beat me i will fawn on you use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me neglect me lose me only give me leave unworthy as i am to follow you what worser place can i beg in your love and yet a place of high respect with me than to be usèd as you use your dog and i am sick when i look not on you your virtue is my privilege for that it is not night when i do see your face therefore i think i am not in the night nor doth this wood lack worlds of company for you in my respect are all the world then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me the wildest hath not such a heart as you run when you will the story shall be changed apollo flies and daphne holds the chase the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed when cowardice pursues and valor flies ay in the temple in the town the field you do me mischief fie demetrius your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex we cannot fight for love as men may do we should be wooed and were not made to woo i'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell to die upon the hand i love so well stay though thou kill me sweet demetrius o wilt thou darkling leave me do not so o i am out of breath in this fond chase the more my prayer the lesser is my grace happy is hermia wheresoe'er she lies for she hath blessèd and attractive eyes how came her eyes so bright not with salt tears if so my eyes are oftener washed than hers no no i am as ugly as a bear for beasts that meet me run away for fear therefore no marvel though demetrius do as a monster fly my presence thus what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with hermia's sphery eyne but who is here lysander on the ground dead or asleep i see no blood no wound  lysander if you live good sir awake do not say so lysander say not so what though he love your hermia lord what though yet hermia still loves you then be content wherefore was i to this keen mockery born when at your hands did i deserve this scorn is 't not enough is 't not enough young man that i did never no nor never can deserve a sweet look from demetrius' eye but you must flout my insufficiency good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do in such disdainful manner me to woo but fare you well perforce i must confess i thought you lord of more true gentleness o that a lady of one man refused should of another therefore be abused you do advance your cunning more and more when truth kills truth o devilish holy fray these vows are hermia's will you give her o'er weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh your vows to her and me put in two scales will even weigh and both as light as tales nor none in my mind now you give her o'er o spite o hell i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment if you were civil and knew courtesy you would not do me thus much injury can you not hate me as i know you do but you must join in souls to mock me too if you were men as men you are in show you would not use a gentle lady so to vow and swear and superpraise my parts when i am sure you hate me with your hearts you both are rivals and love hermia and now both rivals to mock helena a trim exploit a manly enterprise to conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes with your derision none of noble sort would so offend a virgin and extort a poor soul's patience all to make you sport never did mockers waste more idle breath lo she is one of this confederacy now i perceive they have conjoined all three to fashion this false sport in spite of me  injurious hermia most ungrateful maid have you conspired have you with these contrived to bait me with this foul derision is all the counsel that we two have shared the sisters' vows the hours that we have spent when we have chid the hasty footed time for parting us o is all forgot all schooldays' friendship childhood innocence we hermia like two artificial gods have with our needles created both one flower both on one sampler sitting on one cushion both warbling of one song both in one key as if our hands our sides voices and minds had been incorporate so we grew together like to a double cherry seeming parted but yet an union in partition two lovely berries molded on one stem so with two seeming bodies but one heart two of the first like coats in heraldry due but to one and crownèd with one crest and will you rent our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend it is not friendly 'tis not maidenly our sex as well as i may chide you for it though i alone do feel the injury have you not set lysander as in scorn to follow me and praise my eyes and face and made your other love demetrius who even but now did spurn me with his foot to call me goddess nymph divine and rare precious celestial wherefore speaks he this to her he hates and wherefore doth lysander deny your love so rich within his soul and tender me forsooth affection but by your setting on by your consent what though i be not so in grace as you so hung upon with love so fortunate but miserable most to love unloved this you should pity rather than despise ay do persever counterfeit sad looks make mouths upon me when i turn my back wink each at other hold the sweet jest up this sport well carried shall be chronicled if you have any pity grace or manners you would not make me such an argument but fare you well 'tis partly my own fault which death or absence soon shall remedy o excellent yes sooth and so do you fine i' faith have you no modesty no maiden shame no touch of bashfulness what will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you i pray you though you mock me gentlemen let her not hurt me i was never curst i have no gift at all in shrewishness i am a right maid for my cowardice let her not strike me you perhaps may think because she is something lower than myself that i can match her good hermia do not be so bitter with me i evermore did love you hermia did ever keep your counsels never wronged you  save that in love unto demetrius i told him of your stealth unto this wood he followed you for love i followed him but he hath chid me hence and threatened me to strike me spurn me nay to kill me too and now so you will let me quiet go to athens will i bear my folly back and follow you no further let me go you see how simple and how fond i am a foolish heart that i leave here behind with demetrius o when she is angry she is keen and shrewd she was a vixen when she went to school and though she be but little she is fierce i will not trust you i nor longer stay in your curst company your hands than mine are quicker for a fray my legs are longer though to run away o weary night o long and tedious night abate thy hours shine comforts from the east that i may back to athens by daylight from these that my poor company detest and sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye steal me awhile from mine own company so methinks and i have found demetrius like a jewel mine own and not mine own and hippolyta
