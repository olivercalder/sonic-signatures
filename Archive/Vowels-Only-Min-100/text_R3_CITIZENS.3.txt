neighbors god speed doth the news hold of good king edward's death then masters look to see a troublous world woe to that land that's governed by a child stood the state so no no good friends god wot for then this land was famously enriched with politic grave counsel then the king had virtuous uncles to protect his grace better it were they all came by his father or by his father there were none at all for emulation who shall now be nearest will touch us all too near if god prevent not o full of danger is the duke of gloucester and the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud and were they to be ruled and not to rule this sickly land might solace as before when clouds are seen wise men put on their cloaks when great leaves fall then winter is at hand when the sun sets who doth not look for night untimely storms makes men expect a dearth all may be well but if god sort it so 'tis more than we deserve or i expect before the days of change still is it so by a divine instinct men's minds mistrust ensuing danger as by proof we see the water swell before a boist'rous storm but leave it all to god whither away and so was i i'll bear you company
