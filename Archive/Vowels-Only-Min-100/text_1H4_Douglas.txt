thou art the king of honor no man so potent breathes upon the ground but i will beard him faith and so we should where now remains a sweet reversion we may boldly spend upon the hope of what is to come in a comfort of retirement lives in this as heart can think there is not such a word spoke of in scotland as this term of fear that's the worst tidings that i hear of yet talk not of dying i am out of fear of death or death's hand for this one half year you give him then advantage you do not counsel well you speak it out of fear and cold heart yea or tonight defy him by the lord of westmoreland marry and shall and very willingly arm gentlemen to arms for i have thrown a brave defiance in king henry's teeth and westmoreland that was engaged did bear it which cannot choose but bring him quickly on know then my name is douglas and i do haunt thee in the battle thus because some tell me that thou art a king the lord of stafford dear today hath bought thy likeness for instead of thee king harry this sword hath ended him so shall it thee unless thou yield thee as my prisoner all's done all's won here breathless lies the king here a fool go with thy soul whither it goes a borrowed title hast thou bought too dear why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king now by my sword i will kill all his coats i'll murder all his wardrobe piece by piece until i meet the king another king they grow like hydra's heads  i am the douglas fatal to all those that wear those colors on them what art thou that counterfeit'st the person of a king i fear thou art another counterfeit and yet in faith thou bearest thee like a king but mine i am sure thou art whoe'er thou be and thus i win thee
