in sooth i know not why i am so sad it wearies me you say it wearies you but how i caught it found it or came by it what stuff 'tis made of whereof it is born i am to learn and such a want wit sadness makes of me that i have much ado to know myself believe me no i thank my fortune for it my ventures are not in one bottom trusted nor to one place nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year therefore my merchandise makes me not sad fie fie your worth is very dear in my regard i take it your own business calls on you and you embrace th' occasion to depart i hold the world but as the world gratiano a stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one fare you well i'll grow a talker for this gear is that anything now well tell me now what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage that you today promised to tell me of i pray you good bassanio let me know it and if it stand as you yourself still do within the eye of honor be assured my purse my person my extremest means lie all unlocked to your occasions you know me well and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done and i am prest unto it therefore speak thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth try what my credit can in venice do that shall be racked even to the uttermost to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia go presently inquire and so will i where money is and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake shylock albeit i neither lend nor borrow by taking nor by giving of excess yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend i'll break a custom is he yet possessed how much you would and for three months i do never use it and what of him did he take interest this was a venture sir that jacob served for a thing not in his power to bring to pass but swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven was this inserted to make interest good or is your gold and silver ewes and rams mark you this bassanio the devil can cite scripture for his purpose an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek a goodly apple rotten at the heart o what a goodly outside falsehood hath well shylock shall we be beholding to you i am as like to call thee so again to spet on thee again to spurn thee too if thou wilt lend this money lend it not as to thy friends for when did friendship take a breed for barren metal of his friend but lend it rather to thine enemy who if he break thou mayst with better face exact the penalty content in faith i'll seal to such a bond and say there is much kindness in the jew why fear not man i will not forfeit it within these two months that's a month before this bond expires i do expect return of thrice three times the value of this bond yes shylock i will seal unto this bond hie thee gentle jew the hebrew will turn christian he grows kind come on in this there can be no dismay my ships come home a month before the day who's there fie fie gratiano where are all the rest 'tis nine o'clock our friends all stay for you no masque tonight the wind is come about bassanio presently will go aboard i have sent twenty out to seek for you hear me yet good shylock  i pray thee hear me speak  let him alone i'll follow him no more with bootless prayers he seeks my life his reason well i know i oft delivered from his forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me therefore he hates me the duke cannot deny the course of law for the commodity that strangers have with us in venice if it be denied will much impeach the justice of the state since that the trade and profit of the city consisteth of all nations therefore go these griefs and losses have so bated me that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh tomorrow to my bloody creditor  well jailer on pray god bassanio come to see me pay his debt and then i care not ready so please your grace i have heard your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envy's reach i do oppose my patience to his fury and am armed to suffer with a quietness of spirit the very tyranny and rage of his i pray you think you question with the jew you may as well go stand upon the beach and bid the main flood bate his usual height you may as well use question with the wolf why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb you may as well forbid the mountain pines to wag their high tops and to make no noise when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven you may as well do anything most hard as seek to soften that than which what's harder  his jewish heart therefore i do beseech you make no more offers use no farther means but with all brief and plain conveniency let me have judgment and the jew his will i am a tainted wether of the flock meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground and so let me you cannot better be employed bassanio than to live still and write mine epitaph ay so he says i do most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment but little i am armed and well prepared  give me your hand bassanio fare you well grieve not that i am fall'n to this for you for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom it is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow an age of poverty from which ling'ring penance of such misery doth she cut me off commend me to your honorable wife tell her the process of antonio's end say how i loved you speak me fair in death and when the tale is told bid her be judge whether bassanio had not once a love repent but you that you shall lose your friend and he repents not that he pays your debt for if the jew do cut but deep enough i'll pay it instantly with all my heart so please my lord the duke and all the court to quit the fine for one half of his goods i am content so he will let me have the other half in use to render it upon his death unto the gentleman that lately stole his daughter two things provided more that for this favor he presently become a christian the other that he do record a gift here in the court of all he dies possessed unto his son lorenzo and his daughter and stand indebted over and above in love and service to you evermore my lord bassanio let him have the ring let his deservings and my love withal be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment no more than i am well acquitted of i am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels i once did lend my body for his wealth which but for him that had your husband's ring had quite miscarried i dare be bound again my soul upon the forfeit that your lord will never more break faith advisedly here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring i am dumb sweet lady you have given me life and living for here i read for certain that my ships are safely come to road
