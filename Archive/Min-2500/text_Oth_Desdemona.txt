my noble father i do perceive here a divided duty to you i am bound for life and education my life and education both do learn me how to respect you you are the lord of duty i am hitherto your daughter but here's my husband and so much duty as my mother showed to you preferring you before her father so much i challenge that i may profess due to the moor my lord nor would i there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye most gracious duke to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice t' assist my simpleness that i love the moor to live with him my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world my heart's subdued even to the very quality of my lord i saw othello's visage in his mind and to his honors and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate so that dear lords if i be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the war the rites for why i love him are bereft me and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence let me go with him i thank you valiant cassio what tidings can you tell of my lord o but i fear how lost you company alas she has no speech oh fie upon thee slanderer what wouldst write of me if thou shouldst praise me come on assay there's one gone to the harbor i am not merry but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise  come how wouldst thou praise me well praised how if she be black and witty worse and worse these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' th' alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself to do what o most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn of him emilia though he be thy husband how say you cassio is he not a most profane and liberal counselor let's meet him and receive him my dear othello the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase even as our days do grow what is the matter dear be thou assured good cassio i will do all my abilities in thy behalf o that's an honest fellow do not doubt cassio but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were i know 't i thank you you do love my lord you have known him long and be you well assured he shall in strangeness stand no farther off than in a politic distance do not doubt that before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee if i do vow a friendship i'll perform it to the last article my lord shall never rest i'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift i'll intermingle everything he does with cassio's suit therefore be merry cassio for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away why stay and hear me speak well do your discretion how now my lord i have been talking with a suitor here a man that languishes in your displeasure why your lieutenant cassio good my lord if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take for if he be not one that truly loves you that errs in ignorance and not in cunning i have no judgment in an honest face i prithee call him back yes faith so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him good love call him back but shall 't be shortly shall 't be tonight at supper tomorrow dinner then why then tomorrow night or tuesday morn on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn i prithee name the time but let it not exceed three days in faith he's penitent and yet his trespass in our common reason  save that they say the wars must make example out of her best is not almost a fault t' incur a private check when shall he come tell me othello i wonder in my soul what you would ask me that i should deny or stand so mamm'ring on what michael cassio that came a wooing with you and so many a time when i have spoke of you dispraisingly hath ta'en your part to have so much to do to bring him in by 'r lady i could do much  why this is not a boon 'tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person nay when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted shall i deny you no farewell my lord emilia come be as your fancies teach you whate'er you be i am obedient how now my dear othello your dinner and the generous islanders by you invited do attend your presence why do you speak so faintly are you not well faith that's with watching 'twill away again let me but bind it hard within this hour it will be well i am very sorry that you are not well do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies why man go to where lodges he can anything be made of this can you inquire him out and be edified by report seek him bid him come hither tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well where should i lose that handkerchief emilia believe me i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are it were enough to put him to ill thinking who he i think the sun where he was born drew all such humors from him i will not leave him now till cassio be called to him how is 't with you my lord well my good lord it yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow you may indeed say so for 'twas that hand that gave away my heart i cannot speak of this come now your promise i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you here my lord i have it not about me no faith my lord is 't possible i' faith is 't true then would to god that i had never seen 't why do you speak so startingly and rash heaven bless us it is not lost but what an if it were i say it is not lost why so i can but i will not now this is a trick to put me from my suit pray you let cassio be received again come come you'll never meet a more sufficient man i pray talk me of cassio a man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love shared dangers with you  i' faith you are to blame i ne'er saw this before sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief i am most unhappy in the loss of it how now good cassio what's the news with you alas thrice gentle cassio my advocation is not now in tune my lord is not my lord nor should i know him were he in favor as in humor altered so help me every spirit sanctified as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech you must awhile be patient what i can do i will and more i will than for myself i dare let that suffice you i prithee do so something sure of state either from venice or some unhatched practice made demonstrable here in cyprus to him hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases men's natures wrangle with inferior things though great ones are their object 'tis even so for let our finger ache and it endues our other healthful members even to a sense of pain nay we must think men are not gods nor of them look for such observancy as fits the bridal beshrew me much emilia i was unhandsome warrior as i am  arraigning his unkindness with my soul but now i find i had suborned the witness and he's indicted falsely alas the day i never gave him cause heaven keep that monster from othello's mind i will go seek him cassio walk hereabout if i do find him fit i'll move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost and what's the news good cousin lodovico cousin there's fall'n between him and my lord an unkind breach but you shall make all well my lord a most unhappy one i would do much t' atone them for the love i bear to cassio my lord what is he angry by my troth i am glad on 't my lord why sweet othello i have not deserved this i will not stay to offend you my lord my lord what is your will what is your pleasure what horrible fancy's this upon my knees what doth your speech import i understand a fury in your words but not the words your wife my lord your true and loyal wife heaven doth truly know it to whom my lord with whom how am i false alas the heavy day why do you weep am i the motive of these tears my lord if haply you my father do suspect an instrument of this your calling back lay not your blame on me if you have lost him i have lost him too i hope my noble lord esteems me honest alas what ignorant sin have i committed by heaven you do me wrong no as i am a christian if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet i am none no as i shall be saved o heaven forgive us faith half asleep with who who is thy lord i have none do not talk to me emilia i cannot weep nor answers have i none but what should go by water prithee tonight lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember and call thy husband hither 'tis meet i should be used so very meet how have i been behaved that he might stick the small'st opinion on my least misuse i cannot tell those that do teach young babes do it with gentle means and easy tasks he might have chid me so for in good faith i am a child to chiding am i that name iago such as she said my lord did say i was i do not know i am sure i am none such it is my wretched fortune nay heaven doth know if any such there be heaven pardon him alas iago what shall i do to win my lord again good friend go to him for by this light of heaven i know not how i lost him here i kneel if e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love either in discourse of thought or actual deed or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense delighted them in any other form or that i do not yet and ever did and ever will though he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement love him dearly comfort forswear me unkindness may do much and his unkindness may defeat my life but never taint my love i cannot say whore  it does abhor me now i speak the word to do the act that might the addition earn not the world's mass of vanity could make me if 'twere no other  your honor is most welcome my lord i will my lord he says he will return incontinent and hath commanded me to go to bed and bade me to dismiss you it was his bidding therefore good emilia give me my nightly wearing and adieu we must not now displease him so would not i my love doth so approve him that even his stubbornness his checks his frowns  prithee unpin me have grace and favor in them all's one good faith how foolish are our minds if i do die before thee prithee shroud me in one of those same sheets my mother had a maid called barbary she was in love and he she loved proved mad and did forsake her she had a song of willow an old thing 'twas but it expressed her fortune and she died singing it that song tonight will not go from my mind i have much to do but to go hang my head all at one side and sing it like poor barbary prithee dispatch no unpin me here this lodovico is a proper man he speaks well the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree sing all a green willow her hand on her bosom her head on her knee sing willow willow willow the fresh streams ran by her and murmured her moans sing willow willow willow her salt tears fell from her and softened the stones  lay by these sing willow willow willow prithee hie thee he'll come anon sing all a green willow must be my garland let nobody blame him his scorn i approve nay that's not next hark who is 't that knocks i called my love false love but what said he then sing willow willow willow if i court more women you'll couch with more men  so get thee gone good night mine eyes do itch doth that bode weeping i have heard it said so o these men these men dost thou in conscience think tell me emilia  that there be women do abuse their husbands in such gross kind wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world no by this heavenly light wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world in troth i think thou wouldst not beshrew me if i would do such a wrong for the whole world i do not think there is any such woman good night good night god me such uses send not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend who's there othello will you come to bed my lord ay my lord alack my lord what may you mean by that talk you of killing then heaven have mercy on me if you say so i hope you will not kill me and yet i fear you for you're fatal then when your eyes roll so why i should fear i know not since guiltiness i know not but yet i feel i fear they are loves i bear to you that death's unnatural that kills for loving alas why gnaw you so your nether lip some bloody passion shakes your very frame these are portents but yet i hope i hope they do not point on me i will so what's the matter no by my life and soul send for the man and ask him ay but not yet to die then lord have mercy on me and have you mercy too i never did offend you in my life never loved cassio but with such general warranty of heaven as i might love i never gave him token he found it then i never gave it him send for him hither let him confess a truth what my lord how unlawfully he will not say so o my fear interprets what is he dead alas he is betrayed and i undone o banish me my lord but kill me not kill me tomorrow let me live tonight but half an hour but while i say one prayer o falsely falsely murdered a guiltless death i die nobody i myself farewell commend me to my kind lord o farewell
