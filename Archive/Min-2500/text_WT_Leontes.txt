't but of the finer natures by some severals of headpiece extraordinary lower messes perchance are to this business purblind say ha ay but why satisfy th' entreaties of your mistress satisfy let that suffice i have trusted thee camillo with all the nearest things to my heart as well my chamber counsels wherein priestlike thou hast cleansed my bosom i from thee departed thy penitent reformed but we have been deceived in thy integrity deceived in that which seems so to bide upon 't thou art not honest or if thou inclin'st that way thou art a coward which hoxes honesty behind restraining from course required or else thou must be counted a servant grafted in my serious trust and therein negligent or else a fool that seest a game played home the rich stake drawn and tak'st it all for jest ha' not you seen camillo  but that's past doubt you have or your eyeglass is thicker than a cuckold's horn or heard  for to a vision so apparent rumor cannot be mute or thought for cogitation resides not in that man that does not think  my wife is slippery if thou wilt confess  or else be impudently negative to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say my wife's a hobby horse deserves a name as rank as any flax wench that puts to before her troth plight say 't and justify 't is whispering nothing is leaning cheek to cheek is meeting noses kissing with inside lip stopping the career of laughter with a sigh a note infallible of breaking honesty horsing foot on foot skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift hours minutes noon midnight and all eyes blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only that would unseen be wicked is this nothing why then the world and all that's in 't is nothing the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing my wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings if this be nothing say it be 'tis true it is you lie you lie i say thou liest camillo and i hate thee pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave or else a hovering temporizer that canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil inclining to them both were my wife's liver infected as her life she would not live the running of one glass why he that wears her like her medal hanging about his neck bohemia who if i had servants true about me that bare eyes to see alike mine honor as their profits their own particular thrifts they would do that which should undo more doing ay and thou his cupbearer whom i from meaner form have benched and reared to worship who mayst see plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven how i am galled mightst bespice a cup to give mine enemy a lasting wink which draft to me were cordial make that thy question and go rot dost think i am so muddy so unsettled to appoint myself in this vexation sully the purity and whiteness of my sheets  which to preserve is sleep which being spotted is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps  give scandal to the blood o' th' prince my son who i do think is mine and love as mine without ripe moving to 't would i do this could man so blench thou dost advise me even so as i mine own course have set down i'll give no blemish to her honor none this is all do 't and thou hast the one half of my heart do 't not thou splitt'st thine own i will seem friendly as thou hast advised me was he met there his train camillo with him how blest am i in my just censure in my true opinion alack for lesser knowledge how accursed in being so blest there may be in the cup a spider steeped and one may drink depart and yet partake no venom for his knowledge is not infected but if one present th' abhorred ingredient to his eye make known how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides with violent hefts i have drunk and seen the spider camillo was his help in this his pander there is a plot against my life my crown all's true that is mistrusted that false villain whom i employed was pre employed by him he has discovered my design and i remain a pinched thing yea a very trick for them to play at will how came the posterns so easily open i know 't too well give me the boy i am glad you did not nurse him though he does bear some signs of me yet you have too much blood in him bear the boy hence he shall not come about her away with him and let her sport herself with that she's big with for 'tis polixenes has made thee swell thus you my lords look on her mark her well be but about to say she is a goodly lady and the justice of your hearts will thereto add 'tis pity she's not honest honorable praise her but for this her without door form which on my faith deserves high speech and straight the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands that calumny doth use o i am out that mercy does for calumny will sear virtue itself these shrugs these s and s when you have said she's goodly come between ere you can say she's honest but be 't known from him that has most cause to grieve it should be she's an adult'ress you have mistook my lady polixenes for leontes o thou thing which i'll not call a creature of thy place lest barbarism making me the precedent should a like language use to all degrees and mannerly distinguishment leave out betwixt the prince and beggar i have said she's an adult'ress i have said with whom more she's a traitor and camillo is a federary with her and one that knows what she should shame to know herself but with her most vile principal that she's a bed swerver even as bad as those that vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy to this their late escape no if i mistake in those foundations which i build upon the center is not big enough to bear a schoolboy's top away with her to prison he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty but that he speaks shall i be heard go do our bidding hence hold your peaces cease no more you smell this business with a sense as cold as is a dead man's nose but i do see 't and feel 't as you feel doing thus and see withal the instruments that feel what lack i credit why what need we commune with you of this but rather follow our forceful instigation our prerogative calls not your counsels but our natural goodness imparts this which if you or stupefied or seeming so in skill cannot or will not relish a truth like us inform yourselves we need no more of your advice the matter the loss the gain the ord'ring on 't is all properly ours how could that be either thou art most ignorant by age or thou wert born a fool camillo's flight added to their familiarity  which was as gross as ever touched conjecture that lacked sight only naught for approbation but only seeing all other circumstances made up to th' deed doth push on this proceeding yet for a greater confirmation  for in an act of this importance 'twere most piteous to be wild i have dispatched in post to sacred delphos to apollo's temple cleomenes and dion whom you know of stuffed sufficiency now from the oracle they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had shall stop or spur me have i done well though i am satisfied and need no more than what i know yet shall the oracle give rest to th' minds of others such as he whose ignorant credulity will not come up to th' truth so have we thought it good from our free person she should be confined lest that the treachery of the two fled hence be left her to perform come follow us we are to speak in public for this business will raise us all nor night nor day no rest it is but weakness to bear the matter thus mere weakness if the cause were not in being part o' th' cause she th' adult'ress for the harlot king is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank and level of my brain plot proof but she i can hook to me say that she were gone given to the fire a moiety of my rest might come to me again who's there how does the boy to see his nobleness conceiving the dishonor of his mother he straight declined drooped took it deeply fastened and fixed the shame on 't in himself threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep and downright languished leave me solely go see how he fares fie fie no thought of him the very thought of my revenges that way recoil upon me in himself too mighty and in his parties his alliance let him be until a time may serve for present vengeance take it on her camillo and polixenes laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow they should not laugh if i could reach them nor shall she within my power what noise there ho how  away with that audacious lady antigonus i charged thee that she should not come about me i knew she would what canst not rule her good queen force her hence out a mankind witch hence with her out o' door a most intelligencing bawd traitors will you not push her out give her the bastard thou dotard thou art woman tired unroosted by thy dame partlet here take up the bastard take 't up i say give 't to thy crone he dreads his wife a nest of traitors a callet of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband and now baits me this brat is none of mine it is the issue of polixenes hence with it and together with the dam commit them to the fire a gross hag  and losel thou art worthy to be hanged that wilt not stay her tongue once more take her hence i'll ha' thee burnt on your allegiance out of the chamber with her were i a tyrant where were her life she durst not call me so if she did know me one away with her thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this my child away with 't even thou that hast a heart so tender o'er it take it hence and see it instantly consumed with fire even thou and none but thou take it up straight within this hour bring me word 'tis done and by good testimony or i'll seize thy life with what thou else call'st thine if thou refuse and wilt encounter with my wrath say so the bastard brains with these my proper hands shall i dash out go take it to the fire for thou sett'st on thy wife you're liars all i am a feather for each wind that blows shall i live on to see this bastard kneel and call me father better burn it now than curse it then but be it let it live it shall not neither you sir come you hither you that have been so tenderly officious with lady margery your midwife there to save this bastard's life for 'tis a bastard so sure as this beard's gray what will you adventure to save this brat's life it shall be possible swear by this sword thou wilt perform my bidding mark and perform it seest thou for the fail of any point in 't shall not only be death to thyself but to thy lewd tongued wife whom for this time we pardon we enjoin thee as thou art liegeman to us that thou carry this female bastard hence and that thou bear it to some remote and desert place quite out of our dominions and that there thou leave it without more mercy to it own protection and favor of the climate as by strange fortune it came to us i do in justice charge thee on thy soul's peril and thy body's torture that thou commend it strangely to some place where chance may nurse or end it take it up no i'll not rear another's issue twenty three days they have been absent 'tis good speed foretells the great apollo suddenly will have the truth of this appear prepare you lords summon a session that we may arraign our most disloyal lady for as she hath been publicly accused so shall she have a just and open trial while she lives my heart will be a burden to me leave me and think upon my bidding this sessions to our great grief we pronounce even pushes 'gainst our heart the party tried the daughter of a king our wife and one of us too much beloved let us be cleared of being tyrannous since we so openly proceed in justice which shall have due course even to the guilt or the purgation produce the prisoner read the indictment i ne'er heard yet that any of these bolder vices wanted less impudence to gainsay what they did than to perform it first you will not own it you knew of his departure as you know what you have underta'en to do in 's absence your actions are my dreams you had a bastard by polixenes and i but dreamed it as you were past all shame  those of your fact are so so past all truth which to deny concerns more than avails for as thy brat hath been cast out like to itself no father owning it which is indeed more criminal in thee than it so thou shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage look for no less than death break up the seals and read hast thou read truth there is no truth at all i' th' oracle the sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood what is the business how gone apollo's angry and the heavens themselves do strike at my injustice how now there take her hence her heart is but o'ercharged she will recover i have too much believed mine own suspicion beseech you tenderly apply to her some remedies for life apollo pardon my great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle i'll reconcile me to polixenes new woo my queen recall the good camillo whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy for being transported by my jealousies to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose camillo for the minister to poison my friend polixenes which had been done but that the good mind of camillo tardied my swift command though i with death and with reward did threaten and encourage him not doing it and being done he most humane and filled with honor to my kingly guest unclasped my practice quit his fortunes here which you knew great and to the hazard of all incertainties himself commended no richer than his honor how he glisters through my rust and how his piety does my deeds make the blacker go on go on thou canst not speak too much i have deserved all tongues to talk their bitt'rest thou didst speak but well when most the truth which i receive much better than to be pitied of thee prithee bring me to the dead bodies of my queen and son one grave shall be for both upon them shall the causes of their death appear unto our shame perpetual once a day i'll visit the chapel where they lie and tears shed there shall be my recreation so long as nature will bear up with this exercise so long i daily vow to use it come and lead me to these sorrows whilst i remember her and her virtues i cannot forget my blemishes in them and so still think of the wrong i did myself which was so much that heirless it hath made my kingdom and destroyed the sweet'st companion that e'er man bred his hopes out of i think so killed she i killed i did so but thou strik'st me sorely to say i did it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now say so but seldom good paulina who hast the memory of hermione i know in honor o that ever i had squared me to thy counsel then even now i might have looked upon my queen's full eyes have taken treasure from her lips  thou speak'st truth no more such wives therefore no wife one worse and better used would make her sainted spirit again possess her corpse and on this stage where we offenders now appear soul vexed and begin why to me she had and would incense me to murder her i married stars stars and all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wife i'll have no wife paulina never paulina so be blest my spirit my true paulina we shall not marry till thou bid'st us what with him he comes not like to his father's greatness his approach so out of circumstance and sudden tells us 'tis not a visitation framed but forced by need and accident what train his princess say you with him go cleomenes yourself assisted with your honored friends bring them to our embracement still 'tis strange he thus should steal upon us prithee no more cease thou know'st he dies to me again when talked of sure when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches will bring me to consider that which may unfurnish me of reason they are come your mother was most true to wedlock prince for she did print your royal father off conceiving you were i but twenty one your father's image is so hit in you his very air that i should call you brother as i did him and speak of something wildly by us performed before most dearly welcome and your fair princess goddess o alas i lost a couple that 'twixt heaven and earth might thus have stood begetting wonder as you gracious couple do and then i lost  all mine own folly the society amity too of your brave father whom though bearing misery i desire my life once more to look on him o my brother good gentleman the wrongs i have done thee stir afresh within me and these thy offices so rarely kind are as interpreters of my behindhand slackness welcome hither as is the spring to th' earth and hath he too exposed this paragon to th' fearful usage at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune to greet a man not worth her pains much less th' adventure of her person where the warlike smalus that noble honored lord is feared and loved the blessèd gods purge all infection from our air whilst you do climate here you have a holy father a graceful gentleman against whose person so sacred as it is i have done sin for which the heavens taking angry note have left me issueless and your father's blest as he from heaven merits it with you worthy his goodness what might i have been might i a son and daughter now have looked on such goodly things as you where's bohemia speak who camillo you are married my lord is this the daughter of a king that once i see by your good father's speed will come on very slowly i am sorry most sorry you have broken from his liking where you were tied in duty and as sorry your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty that you might well enjoy her would he do so i'd beg your precious mistress which he counts but a trifle i thought of her even in these looks i made but your petition is yet unanswered i will to your father your honor not o'erthrown by your desires i am friend to them and you upon which errand i now go toward him therefore follow me and mark what way i make come good my lord o grave and good paulina the great comfort that i have had of thee o paulina we honor you with trouble but we came to see the statue of our queen your gallery have we passed through not without much content in many singularities but we saw not that which my daughter came to look upon the statue of her mother her natural posture  chide me dear stone that i may say indeed thou art hermione or rather thou art she in thy not chiding for she was as tender as infancy and grace but yet paulina hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing so agèd as this seems as now she might have done so much to my good comfort as it is now piercing to my soul o thus she stood even with such life of majesty warm life as now it coldly stands when first i wooed her i am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me for being more stone than it o royal piece there's magic in thy majesty which has my evils conjured to remembrance and from thy admiring daughter took the spirits standing like stone with thee do not draw the curtain let be let be would i were dead but that methinks already  what was he that did make it see my lord would you not deem it breathed and that those veins did verily bear blood the fixture of her eye has motion in 't as we are mocked with art o sweet paulina make me to think so twenty years together no settled senses of the world can match the pleasure of that madness let 't alone do paulina for this affliction has a taste as sweet as any cordial comfort still methinks there is an air comes from her what fine chisel could ever yet cut breath let no man mock me for i will kiss her no not these twenty years what you can make her do i am content to look on what to speak i am content to hear for 'tis as easy to make her speak as move proceed no foot shall stir o she's warm if this be magic let it be an art lawful as eating o peace paulina thou shouldst a husband take by my consent as i by thine a wife this is a match and made between 's by vows thou hast found mine  but how is to be questioned for i saw her as i thought dead and have in vain said many a prayer upon her grave i'll not seek far  for him i partly know his mind to find thee an honorable husband come camillo and take her by the hand whose worth and honesty is richly noted and here justified by us a pair of kings let's from this place what look upon my brother both your pardons that e'er i put between your holy looks my ill suspicion this your son in law and son unto the king whom heavens directing is troth plight to your daughter good paulina lead us from hence where we may leisurely each one demand and answer to his part performed in this wide gap of time since first we were dissevered hastily lead away
