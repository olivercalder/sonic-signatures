caesar my lord i shall remember when caesar says do this it is performed caesar fear him not caesar he's not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given so to most noble caesar o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure fare thee well  i know not gentlemen what you intend who else must be let blood who else is rank if i myself there is no hour so fit as caesar's death's hour nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords made rich with the most noble blood of all this world i do beseech you if you bear me hard now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke fulfill your pleasure live a thousand years i shall not find myself so apt to die no place will please me so no mean of death as here by caesar and by you cut off the choice and master spirits of this age i doubt not of your wisdom let each man render me his bloody hand first marcus brutus will i shake with you  next caius cassius do i take your hand  now decius brutus yours now yours metellus  yours cinna and my valiant casca yours  though last not least in love yours good trebonius  gentlemen all alas what shall i say my credit now stands on such slippery ground that one of two bad ways you must conceit me either a coward or a flatterer  that i did love thee caesar o 'tis true if then thy spirit look upon us now shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death to see thy antony making his peace shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes  most noble in the presence of thy corpse had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies pardon me julius here wast thou bayed brave hart here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy lethe o world thou wast the forest to this hart and this indeed o world the heart of thee how like a deer strucken by many princes dost thou here lie pardon me caius cassius the enemies of caesar shall say this then in a friend it is cold modesty therefore i took your hands but was indeed swayed from the point by looking down on caesar friends am i with you all and love you all upon this hope that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous that's all i seek and am moreover suitor that i may produce his body to the marketplace and in the pulpit as becomes a friend speak in the order of his funeral be it so i do desire no more o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth that i am meek and gentle with these butchers thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever livèd in the tide of times woe to the hand that shed this costly blood over thy wounds now do i prophesy which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue a curse shall light upon the limbs of men domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quartered with the hands of war all pity choked with custom of fell deeds and caesar's spirit ranging for revenge with ate by his side come hot from hell shall in these confines with a monarch's voice cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men groaning for burial you serve octavius caesar do you not caesar did write for him to come to rome thy heart is big get thee apart and weep passion i see is catching for mine eyes seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine began to water is thy master coming post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome no rome of safety for octavius yet hie hence and tell him so yet stay awhile thou shalt not back till i have borne this corpse into the marketplace there shall i try in my oration how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men according to the which thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things lend me your hand for brutus' sake i am beholding to you you gentle romans  friends romans countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury caesar not to praise him the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interrèd with their bones so let it be with caesar the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answered it here under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honorable man so are they all all honorable men come i to speak in caesar's funeral he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honorable man he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honorable man you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse was this ambition yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honorable man i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do know you all did love him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourn for him  o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason bear with me my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pause till it come back to me but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world now lies he there and none so poor to do him reverence o masters if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honorable men i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you than i will wrong such honorable men but here's a parchment with the seal of caesar i found it in his closet 'tis his will let but the commons hear this testament which pardon me i do not mean to read and they would go and kiss dead caesar's wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood  yea beg a hair of him for memory and dying mention it within their wills bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue have patience gentle friends i must not read it it is not meet you know how caesar loved you you are not wood you are not stones but men and being men hearing the will of caesar it will inflame you it will make you mad 'tis good you know not that you are his heirs for if you should o what would come of it will you be patient will you stay awhile i have o'ershot myself to tell you of it i fear i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed caesar i do fear it you will compel me then to read the will then make a ring about the corpse of caesar and let me show you him that made the will shall i descend and will you give me leave nay press not so upon me stand far off if you have tears prepare to shed them now you all do know this mantle i remember the first time ever caesar put it on 'twas on a summer's evening in his tent that day he overcame the nervii look in this place ran cassius' dagger through see what a rent the envious casca made through this the well belovèd brutus stabbed and as he plucked his cursèd steel away mark how the blood of caesar followed it as rushing out of doors to be resolved if brutus so unkindly knocked or no for brutus as you know was caesar's angel judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors' arms quite vanquished him then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling up his face even at the base of pompey's statue which all the while ran blood great caesar fell o what a fall was there my countrymen then i and you and all of us fell down whilst bloody treason flourished over us o now you weep and i perceive you feel the dint of pity these are gracious drops kind souls what weep you when you but behold our caesar's vesture wounded look you here here is himself marred as you see with traitors stay countrymen good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny they that have done this deed are honorable what private griefs they have alas i know not that made them do it they are wise and honorable and will no doubt with reasons answer you i come not friends to steal away your hearts i am no orator as brutus is but as you know me all a plain blunt man that love my friend and that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of him for i have neither wit nor words nor worth action nor utterance nor the power of speech to stir men's blood i only speak right on i tell you that which you yourselves do know show you sweet caesar's wounds poor poor dumb mouths and bid them speak for me but were i brutus and brutus antony there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of caesar that should move the stones of rome to rise and mutiny yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak why friends you go to do you know not what wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves alas you know not i must tell you then you have forgot the will i told you of here is the will and under caesar's seal to every roman citizen he gives to every several man seventy five drachmas hear me with patience moreover he hath left you all his walks his private arbors and new planted orchards on this side tiber he hath left them you and to your heirs forever common pleasures to walk abroad and recreate yourselves here was a caesar when comes such another now let it work mischief thou art afoot take thou what course thou wilt how now fellow where is he and thither will i straight to visit him he comes upon a wish fortune is merry and in this mood will give us anything belike they had some notice of the people how i had moved them bring me to octavius these many then shall die their names are pricked he shall not live look with a spot i damn him but lepidus go you to caesar's house fetch the will hither and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies this is a slight unmeritable man meet to be sent on errands is it fit the threefold world divided he should stand one of the three to share it octavius i have seen more days than you and though we lay these honors on this man to ease ourselves of diverse sland'rous loads he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold to groan and sweat under the business either led or driven as we point the way and having brought our treasure where we will then take we down his load and turn him off like to the empty ass to shake his ears and graze in commons so is my horse octavius and for that i do appoint him store of provender it is a creature that i teach to fight to wind to stop to run directly on his corporal motion governed by my spirit and in some taste is lepidus but so he must be taught and trained and bid go forth  a barren spirited fellow one that feeds on objects arts and imitations which out of use and staled by other men begin his fashion do not talk of him but as a property and now octavius listen great things brutus and cassius are levying powers we must straight make head therefore let our alliance be combined our best friends made our means stretched and let us presently go sit in council how covert matters may be best disclosed and open perils surest answerèd tut i am in their bosoms and i know wherefore they do it they could be content to visit other places and come down with fearful bravery thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage but 'tis not so octavius lead your battle softly on upon the left hand of the even field why do you cross me in this exigent no caesar we will answer on their charge make forth the generals would have some words in your bad strokes brutus you give good words witness the hole you made in caesar's heart crying long live hail caesar not stingless too villains you did not so when your vile daggers hacked one another in the sides of caesar you showed your teeth like apes and fawned like hounds and bowed like bondmen kissing caesar's feet whilst damnèd casca like a cur behind struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers old cassius still where is he this is not brutus friend but i assure you a prize no less in worth keep this man safe give him all kindness i had rather have such men my friends than enemies go on and see whe'er brutus be alive or dead and bring us word unto octavius' tent how everything is chanced this was the noblest roman of them all all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar he only in a general honest thought and common good to all made one of them his life was gentle and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world this was a man
