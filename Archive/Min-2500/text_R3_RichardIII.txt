now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of york and all the clouds that loured upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruisèd arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changed to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures grim visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barbèd steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous looking glass i that am rudely stamped and want love's majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph i that am curtailed of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deformed unfinished sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them  why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to see my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair well spoken days i am determinèd to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mewed up about a prophecy which says that g of edward's heirs the murderer shall be dive thoughts down to my soul here clarence comes brother good day what means this armèd guard that waits upon your grace upon what cause alack my lord that fault is none of yours he should for that commit your godfathers o belike his majesty hath some intent that you should be new christened in the tower but what's the matter clarence may i know why this it is when men are ruled by women 'tis not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife clarence 'tis she that tempers him to this extremity was it not she and that good man of worship anthony woodeville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is delivered we are not safe clarence we are not safe humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty i'll tell you what i think it is our way if we will keep in favor with the king to be her men and wear her livery the jealous o'erworn widow and herself since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen are mighty gossips in our monarchy even so an please your worship brakenbury you may partake of anything we say we speak no treason man we say the king is wise and virtuous and his noble queen well struck in years fair and not jealous we say that shore's wife hath a pretty foot a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue and that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks how say you sir can you deny all this naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow he that doth naught with her excepting one were best to do it secretly alone we are the queen's abjects and must obey  brother farewell i will unto the king and whatsoe'er you will employ me in were it to call king edward's widow sister i will perform it to enfranchise you meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine well your imprisonment shall not be long i will deliver you or else lie for you meantime have patience go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return simple plain clarence i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven if heaven will take the present at our hands but who comes here the new delivered hastings as much unto my good lord chamberlain well are you welcome to the open air how hath your lordship brooked imprisonment no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too for they that were your enemies are his and have prevailed as much on him as you what news abroad now by saint john that news is bad indeed o he hath kept an evil diet long and overmuch consumed his royal person 'tis very grievous to be thought upon where is he in his bed go you before and i will follow you he cannot live i hope and must not die till george be packed with post horse up to heaven i'll in to urge his hatred more to clarence with lies well steeled with weighty arguments and if i fail not in my deep intent clarence hath not another day to live which done god take king edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in for then i'll marry warwick's youngest daughter what though i killed her husband and her father the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father the which will i not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto but yet i run before my horse to market clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns when they are gone then must i count my gains stay you that bear the corse and set it down villains set down the corse or by saint paul i'll make a corse of him that disobeys unmannered dog stand thou when i command  advance thy halberd higher than my breast or by saint paul i'll strike thee to my foot and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness sweet saint for charity be not so curst lady you know no rules of charity which renders good for bad blessings for curses but i know none and therefore am no beast more wonderful when angels are so angry vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman of these supposèd crimes to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself fairer than tongue can name thee let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself by such despair i should accuse myself say that i slew them not i did not kill your husband nay he is dead and slain by edward's hands i was provokèd by her sland'rous tongue that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders i grant you the better for the king of heaven that hath him let him thank me that holp to send him thither for he was fitter for that place than earth yes one place else if you will hear me name it your bedchamber so will it madam till i lie with you i know so but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall something into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner your beauty was the cause of that effect  your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom these eyes could not endure that beauty's wrack you should not blemish it if i stood by as all the world is cheerèd by the sun so i by that it is my day my life curse not thyself fair creature thou art both it is a quarrel most unnatural to be revenged on him that loveth thee he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband he lives that loves thee better than he could plantagenet the selfsame name but one of better nature here why dost thou spit at me never came poison from so sweet a place thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears shamed their aspects with store of childish drops these eyes which never shed remorseful tear  no when my father york and edward wept to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when black faced clifford shook his sword at him nor when thy warlike father like a child told the sad story of my father's death and twenty times made pause to sob and weep that all the standers by had wet their cheeks like trees bedashed with rain in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is proposed my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made for kissing lady not for such contempt if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive lo here i lend thee this sharp pointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true breast and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee nay do not pause for i did kill king henry  but 'twas thy beauty that provokèd me nay now dispatch 'twas i that stabbed young edward  but 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on take up the sword again or take up me then bid me kill myself and i will do it that was in thy rage speak it again and even with the word this hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths shalt thou be accessory 'tis figured in my tongue then never was man true say then my peace is made but shall i live in hope vouchsafe to wear this ring look how my ring encompasseth thy finger even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart wear both of them for both of them are thine and if thy poor devoted servant may but beg one favor at thy gracious hand thou dost confirm his happiness forever that it may please you leave these sad designs to him that hath most cause to be a mourner and presently repair to crosby house where after i have solemnly interred at chertsey monast'ry this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears i will with all expedient duty see you for divers unknown reasons i beseech you grant me this boon bid me farewell no to whitefriars there attend my coming was ever woman in this humor wooed was ever woman in this humor won i'll have her but i will not keep her long what i that killed her husband and his father to take her in her heart's extremest hate with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes the bleeding witness of my hatred by having god her conscience and these bars against me and i no friends to back my suit at all but the plain devil and dissembling looks and yet to win her all the world to nothing ha hath she forgot already that brave prince edward her lord whom i some three months since stabbed in my angry mood at tewkesbury a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman framed in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal the spacious world cannot again afford and will she yet abase her eyes on me that cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woeful bed on me whose all not equals edward's moiety on me that halts and am misshapen thus my dukedom to a beggarly denier i do mistake my person all this while upon my life she finds although i cannot myself to be a marv'lous proper man i'll be at charges for a looking glass and entertain a score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body since i am crept in favor with myself i will maintain it with some little cost but first i'll turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass that i may see my shadow as i pass they do me wrong and i will not endure it who is it that complains unto the king that i forsooth am stern and love them not by holy paul they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumors because i cannot flatter and look fair smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog duck with french nods and apish courtesy i must be held a rancorous enemy cannot a plain man live and think no harm but thus his simple truth must be abused with silken sly insinuating jacks to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace when have i injured thee when done thee wrong  or thee or thee or any of your faction a plague upon you all his royal grace whom god preserve better than you would wish cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while but you must trouble him with lewd complaints i cannot tell the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch since every jack became a gentleman there's many a gentle person made a jack meantime god grants that we have need of you our brother is imprisoned by your means myself disgraced and the nobility held in contempt while great promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble you may deny that you were not the mean of my lord hastings' late imprisonment she may lord rivers why who knows not so she may do more sir than denying that she may help you to many fair preferments and then deny her aiding hand therein and lay those honors on your high desert what may she not she may ay marry may she  what marry may she marry with a king a bachelor and a handsome stripling too iwis your grandam had a worser match what threat you me with telling of the king tell him and spare not look what i have said i will avouch 't in presence of the king i dare adventure to be sent to th' tower 'tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot ere you were queen ay or your husband king i was a packhorse in his great affairs a weeder out of his proud adversaries a liberal rewarder of his friends to royalize his blood i spent mine own in all which time you and your husband grey were factious for the house of lancaster  and rivers so were you was not your husband in margaret's battle at saint albans slain let me put in your minds if you forget what you have been ere this and what you are withal what i have been and what i am poor clarence did forsake his father warwick ay and forswore himself which jesu pardon  to fight on edward's party for the crown and for his meed poor lord he is mewed up i would to god my heart were flint like edward's or edward's soft and pitiful like mine i am too childish foolish for this world if i should be i had rather be a peddler far be it from my heart the thought thereof foul wrinkled witch what mak'st thou in my sight wert thou not banishèd on pain of death the curse my noble father laid on thee when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper and with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes and then to dry them gav'st the duke a clout steeped in the faultless blood of pretty rutland  his curses then from bitterness of soul denounced against thee are all fall'n upon thee and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed have done thy charm thou hateful withered hag margaret ha i cry thee mercy then for i did think that thou hadst called me all these bitter names 'tis done by me and ends in margaret good counsel marry learn it learn it marquess ay and much more but i was born so high our aerie buildeth in the cedar's top and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun what doth she say my lord of buckingham i cannot blame her by god's holy mother she hath had too much wrong and i repent my part thereof that i have done to her yet you have all the vantage of her wrong i was too hot to do somebody good that is too cold in thinking of it now marry as for clarence he is well repaid he is franked up to fatting for his pains god pardon them that are the cause thereof so do i ever being well advised for had i cursed now i had cursed myself i do the wrong and first begin to brawl the secret mischiefs that i set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others clarence who i indeed have cast in darkness i do beweep to many simple gulls namely to derby hastings buckingham and tell them 'tis the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke my brother now they believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on rivers dorset grey but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that god bids us do good for evil and thus i clothe my naked villainy with odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil but soft here come my executioners  how now my hardy stout resolvèd mates are you now going to dispatch this thing well thought upon i have it here about me when you have done repair to crosby place but sirs be sudden in the execution withal obdurate do not hear him plead for clarence is well spoken and perhaps may move your hearts to pity if you mark him your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall tears i like you lads about your business straight go go dispatch good morrow to my sovereign king and queen and princely peers a happy time of day a blessèd labor my most sovereign lord among this princely heap if any here by false intelligence or wrong surmise hold me a foe if i unwittingly or in my rage have aught committed that is hardly borne by any in this presence i desire to reconcile me to his friendly peace 'tis death to me to be at enmity i hate it and desire all good men's love first madam i entreat true peace of you which i will purchase with my duteous service  of you my noble cousin buckingham if ever any grudge were lodged between us  of you and you lord rivers and of dorset that all without desert have frowned on me  of you lord woodeville and lord scales of you dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all i do not know that englishman alive with whom my soul is any jot at odds more than the infant that is born tonight i thank my god for my humility why madam have i offered love for this to be so flouted in this royal presence who knows not that the gentle duke is dead you do him injury to scorn his corse but he poor man by your first order died and that a wingèd mercury did bear some tardy cripple bare the countermand that came too lag to see him burièd god grant that some less noble and less loyal nearer in bloody thoughts and not in blood deserve not worse than wretched clarence did and yet go current from suspicion this is the fruits of rashness marked you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen looked pale when they did hear of clarence' death o they did urge it still unto the king god will revenge it come lords will you go to comfort edward with our company sister have comfort all of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star but none can help our harms by wailing them  madam my mother i do cry you mercy i did not see your grace humbly on my knee i crave your blessing amen and make me die a good old man that is the butt end of a mother's blessing i marvel that her grace did leave it out i hope the king made peace with all of us and the compact is firm and true in me then be it so and go we to determine who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow  madam and you my sister will you go to give your censures in this business my other self my council's consistory my oracle my prophet my dear cousin i as a child will go by thy direction toward ludlow then for we'll not stay behind welcome dear cousin my thoughts' sovereign the weary way hath made you melancholy sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years hath not yet dived into the world's deceit nor more can you distinguish of a man than of his outward show which god he knows seldom or never jumpeth with the heart those uncles which you want were dangerous your grace attended to their sugared words but looked not on the poison of their hearts god keep you from them and from such false friends my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you where it seems best unto your royal self if i may counsel you some day or two your highness shall repose you at the tower then where you please and shall be thought most fit for your best health and recreation so wise so young they say do never live long i say without characters fame lives long thus like the formal vice iniquity i moralize two meanings in one word short summers lightly have a forward spring how fares our cousin noble lord of york he hath my lord o my fair cousin i must not say so he may command me as my sovereign but you have power in me as in a kinsman my dagger little cousin with all my heart a greater gift than that i'll give my cousin ay gentle cousin were it light enough it is too heavy for your grace to wear what would you have my weapon little lord how my lord will 't please you pass along myself and my good cousin buckingham will to your mother to entreat of her to meet you at the tower and welcome you why what should you fear nor none that live i hope no doubt no doubt o 'tis a parlous boy bold quick ingenious forward capable he is all the mother's from the top to toe commend me to lord william tell him catesby his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries tomorrow are let blood at pomfret castle and bid my lord for joy of this good news give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep at crosby house there shall you find us both chop off his head something we will determine and look when i am king claim thou of me the earldom of hereford and all the movables whereof the king my brother was possessed and look to have it yielded with all kindness come let us sup betimes that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form my noble lords and cousins all good morrow i have been long a sleeper but i trust my absence doth neglect no great design which by my presence might have been concluded than my lord hastings no man might be bolder his lordship knows me well and loves me well  my lord of ely when i was last in holborn i saw good strawberries in your garden there i do beseech you send for some of them cousin of buckingham a word with you catesby hath sounded hastings in our business and finds the testy gentleman so hot that he will lose his head ere give consent his master's child as worshipfully he terms it shall lose the royalty of england's throne i pray you all tell me what they deserve that do conspire my death with devilish plots of damnèd witchcraft and that have prevailed upon my body with their hellish charms then be your eyes the witness of their evil look how i am bewitched behold mine arm is like a blasted sapling withered up and this is edward's wife that monstrous witch consorted with that harlot strumpet shore that by their witchcraft thus have markèd me if thou protector of this damnèd strumpet talk'st thou to me of ifs thou art a traitor  off with his head now by saint paul i swear i will not dine until i see the same  lovell and ratcliffe look that it be done  the rest that love me rise and follow me come cousin canst thou quake and change thy color murder thy breath in middle of a word and then again begin and stop again as if thou were distraught and mad with terror he is and see he brings the mayor along look to the drawbridge there catesby o'erlook the walls look back defend thee here are enemies be patient they are friends ratcliffe and lovell so dear i loved the man that i must weep i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathed upon the earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts so smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted  i mean his conversation with shore's wife  he lived from all attainder of suspects what think you we are turks or infidels or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly in the villain's death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons' safety enforced us to this execution and to that end we wished your lordship here t' avoid the censures of the carping world go after after cousin buckingham the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post there at your meetest vantage of the time infer the bastardy of edward's children tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown meaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was termèd so moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretched unto their servants daughters wives even where his raging eye or savage heart without control lusted to make a prey nay for a need thus far come near my person tell them when that my mother went with child of that insatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by true computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appearèd in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father yet touch this sparingly as 'twere far off because my lord you know my mother lives if you thrive well bring them to baynard's castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well learnèd bishops go lovell with all speed to doctor shaa go thou to friar penker bid them both meet me within this hour at baynard's castle now will i go to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give order that no manner person have any time recourse unto the princes how now how now what say the citizens touched you the bastardy of edward's children and did they so what tongueless blocks were they would they not speak will not the mayor then and his brethren come i go an if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt we bring it to a happy issue my lord there needs no such apology i do beseech your grace to pardon me who earnest in the service of my god deferred the visitation of my friends but leaving this what is your grace's pleasure i do suspect i have done some offense that seems disgracious in the city's eye and that you come to reprehend my ignorance else wherefore breathe i in a christian land i cannot tell if to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think tongue tied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so seasoned with your faithful love to me then on the other side i checked my friends therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as the ripe revenue and due of birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects that i would rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapor of my glory smothered but god be thanked there is no need of me and much i need to help you were there need the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellowed by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign on him i lay that you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him alas why would you heap this care on me i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you o do not swear my lord of buckingham will you enforce me to a world of cares call them again i am not made of stones but penetrable to your kind entreaties albeit against my conscience and my soul cousin of buckingham and sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burden whe'er i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foul faced reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god doth know and you may partly see how far i am from the desire of this in saying so you shall but say the truth even when you please for you will have it so come let us to our holy work again  farewell my cousin farewell gentle friends stand all apart cousin of buckingham give me thy hand thus high by thy advice and thy assistance is king richard seated but shall we wear these glories for a day or shall they last and we rejoice in them ah buckingham now do i play the touch to try if thou be current gold indeed young edward lives think now what i would speak why buckingham i say i would be king ha am i king 'tis so but edward lives o bitter consequence that edward still should live true noble prince cousin thou wast not wont to be so dull shall i be plain i wish the bastards dead and i would have it suddenly performed what sayst thou now speak suddenly be brief tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezes say have i thy consent that they shall die i will converse with iron witted fools and unrespective boys none are for me that look into me with considerate eyes high reaching buckingham grows circumspect  boy know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold will tempt unto a close exploit of death what is his name i partly know the man go call him hither boy the deep revolving witty buckingham no more shall be the neighbor to my counsels hath he so long held out with me untired and stops he now for breath well be it so how now lord stanley what's the news come hither catesby rumor it abroad that anne my wife is very grievous sick i will take order for her keeping close inquire me out some mean poor gentleman whom i will marry straight to clarence' daughter the boy is foolish and i fear not him look how thou dream'st i say again give out that anne my queen is sick and like to die about it for it stands me much upon to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me i must be married to my brother's daughter or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass murder her brothers and then marry her  uncertain way of gain but i am in so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin tear falling pity dwells not in this eye is thy name tyrrel art thou indeed dar'st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine why then thou hast it two deep enemies foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers are they that i would have thee deal upon tyrrel i mean those bastards in the tower thou sing'st sweet music hark come hither tyrrel go by this token rise and lend thine ear there is no more but so say it is done and i will love thee and prefer thee for it well let that rest dorset is fled to richmond stanley he is your wife's son well look unto it stanley look to your wife if she convey letters to richmond you shall answer it i do remember me henry the sixth did prophesy that richmond should be king when richmond was a little peevish boy a king perhaps  how chance the prophet could not at that time have told me i being by that i should kill him richmond when last i was at exeter the mayor in courtesy showed me the castle and called it rougemont at which name i started because a bard of ireland told me once i should not live long after i saw richmond ay what's o'clock well but what's o'clock well let it strike because that like a jack thou keep'st the stroke betwixt thy begging and my meditation i am not in the giving vein today thou troublest me i am not in the vein kind tyrrel am i happy in thy news but did'st thou see them dead and buried gentle tyrrel come to me tyrrel soon at after supper when thou shalt tell the process of their death meantime but think how i may do thee good and be inheritor of thy desire farewell till then the son of clarence have i pent up close his daughter meanly have i matched in marriage the sons of edward sleep in abraham's bosom and anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight now for i know the breton richmond aims at young elizabeth my brother's daughter and by that knot looks proudly on the crown to her go i a jolly thriving wooer good or bad news that thou com'st in so bluntly ely with richmond troubles me more near than buckingham and his rash levied strength come i have learned that fearful commenting is leaden servitor to dull delay delay leads impotent and snail paced beggary then fiery expedition be my wing jove's mercury and herald for a king go muster men my counsel is my shield we must be brief when traitors brave the field who intercepts me in my expedition a flourish trumpets strike alarum drums let not the heavens hear these telltale women rail on the lord's anointed strike i say either be patient and entreat me fair or

i fear myself there's none else by richard loves richard that is i am i is there a murderer here no yes i am then fly what from myself great reason why lest i revenge what myself upon myself alack i love myself wherefore for any good that i myself have done unto myself o no alas i rather hate myself for hateful deeds committed by myself i am a villain yet i lie i am not fool of thyself speak well fool do not flatter my conscience hath a thousand several tongues and every tongue brings in a several tale and every tale condemns me for a villain perjury perjury in the highest degree murder stern murder in the direst degree all several sins all used in each degree throng to the bar crying all guilty guilty i shall despair there is no creature loves me and if i die no soul will pity me and wherefore should they since that i myself find in myself no pity to myself methought the souls of all that i had murdered came to my tent and every one did threat tomorrow's vengeance on the head of richard zounds who is there o ratcliffe i have dreamed a fearful dream what think'st thou will our friends prove all true o ratcliffe i fear i fear by the apostle paul shadows tonight have struck more terror to the soul of richard than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers armed in proof and led by shallow richmond 'tis not yet near day come go with me under our tents i'll play the eavesdropper to see if any mean to shrink from me what said northumberland as touching richmond he said the truth and what said surrey then he was in the right and so indeed it is tell the clock there give me a calendar who saw the sun today then he disdains to shine for by the book he should have braved the east an hour ago a black day will it be to somebody ratcliffe the sun will not be seen today the sky doth frown and lour upon our army i would these dewy tears were from the ground not shine today why what is that to me more than to richmond for the selfsame heaven that frowns on me looks sadly upon him come bustle bustle caparison my horse  call up lord stanley bid him bring his power  i will lead forth my soldiers to the plain and thus my battle shall be orderèd my foreward shall be drawn out all in length consisting equally of horse and foot our archers shall be placèd in the midst john duke of norfolk thomas earl of surrey shall have the leading of this foot and horse they thus directed we will follow in the main battle whose puissance on either side shall be well wingèd with our chiefest horse this and saint george to boot what think'st thou norfolk jockey of norfolk be not so bold for dickon thy master is bought and sold a thing devisèd by the enemy  go gentlemen every man unto his charge let not our babbling dreams affright our souls conscience is but a word that cowards use devised at first to keep the strong in awe our strong arms be our conscience swords our law march on join bravely let us to it pell mell if not to heaven then hand in hand to hell what shall i say more than i have inferred remember whom you are to cope withal a sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways a scum of bretons and base lackey peasants whom their o'ercloyèd country vomits forth to desperate adventures and assured destruction you sleeping safe they bring to you unrest you having lands and blessed with beauteous wives they would restrain the one distain the other and who doth lead them but a paltry fellow long kept in brittany at our mother's cost a milksop one that never in his life felt so much cold as overshoes in snow let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again lash hence these overweening rags of france these famished beggars weary of their lives who but for dreaming on this fond exploit for want of means poor rats had hanged themselves if we be conquered let men conquer us and not these bastard bretons whom our fathers have in their own land beaten bobbed and thumped and in record left them the heirs of shame shall these enjoy our lands lie with our wives ravish our daughters hark i hear their drum fight gentlemen of england fight bold yeomen  draw archers draw your arrows to the head  spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood amaze the welkin with your broken staves  what says lord stanley will he bring his power off with his son george's head a thousand hearts are great within my bosom advance our standards set upon our foes our ancient word of courage fair saint george inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons upon them victory sits on our helms a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse slave i have set my life upon a cast and i will stand the hazard of the die i think there be six richmonds in the field five have i slain today instead of him a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse
