bewept a worthy husband's death and lived with looking on his images but now two mirrors of his princely semblance are cracked in pieces by malignant death and i for comfort have but one false glass

from my feeble hands clarence and edward o what cause have i thine being but a moiety of my moan to overgo thy woes and drown thy cries alas for both both mine edward and clarence what stays had i but they and they are gone was never mother had so dear a loss alas i am the mother of these griefs their woes are parceled mine is general she for an edward weeps and so do i i for a clarence weep so

if his rule were true he should be gracious i hope he is but yet let mothers doubt how my young york i prithee let me hear it i prithee pretty york who told thee this his nurse why she was dead ere thou wast born good madam be not angry with the child what is thy news who hath committed them accursèd and unquiet wrangling days how many of you have mine eyes beheld my husband lost his life to get the crown and often up and down my sons were tossed for me to joy and weep their gain and loss and being seated and domestic broils clean overblown themselves the conquerors make war upon themselves brother to brother blood to blood self against self o preposterous and frantic outrage end thy damnèd spleen or let me die to look on earth no more stay i will go with you who meets us here my niece plantagenet led in the hand of her kind aunt of gloucester now for my life she's wandering to the tower on pure heart's love to greet the tender prince  daughter well met i am their father's mother i

guide thee go thou to richard and good angels tend thee go thou to sanctuary and good thoughts possess thee i to my grave where peace and rest lie with me eighty odd years of sorrow have i seen and each hour's joy wracked with a week of teen so many miseries have crazed my voice that my woe wearied tongue is still and mute edward plantagenet why art thou dead dead life blind sight poor mortal living ghost woe's scene world's shame grave's due by life usurped brief abstract and record of tedious days rest thy unrest on england's lawful earth unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood i had a richard too and thou did'st kill him i had a rutland too thou holp'st to kill him o harry's wife triumph not in my woes god witness with me i have wept for thine why should calamity be full of words if so then be not tongue tied go with me and in the breath of bitter words let's smother my damnèd son that thy two sweet sons smothered the trumpet sounds be copious in exclaims o she that might have intercepted thee by strangling thee in her accursèd womb from all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done thou toad thou toad where is thy brother clarence and little ned plantagenet his son where is kind hastings art thou my son then patiently hear my impatience o let me speak i will be mild and gentle in my words art thou so hasty i have stayed for thee god knows in torment and in agony no by the holy rood thou know'st it well thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell a grievous burden was thy birth to me tetchy and wayward was thy infancy thy school days frightful desp'rate wild and furious thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous thy age confirmed proud subtle sly and bloody more mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred what comfortable hour canst thou name that ever graced me with thy company i prithee hear me speak hear me a word for i shall never speak to thee again either thou wilt die by god's just ordinance ere from this war thou turn a conqueror or i with grief and extreme age shall perish and nevermore behold thy face again therefore take with thee my most grievous curse which in the day of battle tire thee more than all the complete armor that thou wear'st my prayers on the adverse party fight and there the little souls of edward's children whisper the spirits of thine enemies and promise them success and victory bloody thou art bloody will be thy end shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend
