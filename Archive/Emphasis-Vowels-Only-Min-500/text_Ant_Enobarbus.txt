bring in the banquet quickly wine enough cleopatra's health to drink mine and most of our fortunes tonight shall be drunk to bed hush here comes antony no lady madam what's your pleasure sir why then we kill all our women we see how mortal an unkindness is to them if they suffer our departure death's the word under a compelling occasion let women die it were pity to cast them away for nothing though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing cleopatra catching but the least noise of this dies instantly i have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment i do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her she hath such a celerity in dying alack sir no her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love we cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report this cannot be cunning in her if it be she makes a shower of rain as well as jove o sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel sir fulvia why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice when it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth comforting therein that when old robes are worn out there are members to make new if there were no more women but fulvia then had you indeed a cut and the case to be lamented this grief is crowned with consolation your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow and the business you have broached here cannot be without you especially that of cleopatra's which wholly depends on your abode i shall do 't i shall entreat him to answer like himself if caesar move him let antony look over caesar's head and speak as loud as mars by jupiter were i the wearer of antonio's beard i would not shave 't today every time serves for the matter that is then born in 't not if the small come first and yonder caesar would we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the women or if you borrow one another's love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of pompey return it again you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do that truth should be silent i had almost forgot go to then your considerate stone half the heart of caesar worthy maecenas my honorable friend agrippa ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking this was but as a fly by an eagle we had much more monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting when she first met mark antony she pursed up his heart upon the river of cydnus i will tell you the barge she sat in like a burnished throne burned on the water the poop was beaten gold purple the sails and so perfumed that the winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made the water which they beat to follow faster as amorous of their strokes for her own person it beggared all description she did lie in her pavilion cloth of gold of tissue  o'erpicturing that venus where we see the fancy outwork nature on each side her stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling cupids with divers colored fans whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool and what they undid did her gentlewomen like the nereides so many mermaids tended her i' th' eyes and made their bends adornings at the helm a seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle swell with the touches of those flower soft hands that yarely frame the office from the barge a strange invisible perfume hits the sense of the adjacent wharfs the city cast her people out upon her and antony enthroned i' th' market place did sit alone whistling to th' air which but for vacancy had gone to gaze on cleopatra too and made a gap in nature upon her landing antony sent to her invited her to supper she replied it should be better he became her guest which she entreated our courteous antony whom ne'er the word of no woman heard speak being barbered ten times o'er goes to the feast and for his ordinary pays his heart for what his eyes eat only i saw her once hop forty paces through the public street and having lost her breath she spoke and panted that she did make defect perfection and breathless pour breath forth never he will not age cannot wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety other women cloy the appetites they feed but she makes hungry where most she satisfies for vilest things become themselves in her that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish humbly sir i thank you no more of that he did so a certain queen to caesar in a mattress well and well am like to do for i perceive four feasts are toward sir i never loved you much but i ha' praised you when you have well deserved ten times as much as i have said you did at sea i think you have done well by water i will praise any man that will praise me though it cannot be denied what i have done by land yes something you can deny for your own safety you have been a great thief by sea there i deny my land service but give me your hand menas if our eyes had authority here they might take two thieves kissing but there is never a fair woman has a true face we came hither to fight with you if he do sure he cannot weep 't back again caesar's sister is called octavia but she is now the wife of marcus antonius 'tis true if i were bound to divine of this unity i would not prophesy so i think so too but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation not he that himself is not so which is mark antony he will to his egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar and as i said before that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance antony will use his affection where it is he married but his occasion here i shall take it sir we have used our throats in egypt not till you have slept i fear me you'll be in till then here's to thee menas there's a strong fellow menas he bears the third part of the world man seest not drink thou increase the reels ha my brave emperor shall we dance now the egyptian bacchanals and celebrate our drink all take hands make battery to our ears with the loud music the while i'll place you then the boy shall sing the holding every man shall beat as loud as his strong sides can volley cup us till the world go round cup us till the world go round take heed you fall not menas i'll not on shore hoo says 'a there's my cap they have dispatched with pompey he is gone the other three are sealing octavia weeps to part from rome caesar is sad and lepidus since pompey's feast as menas says is troubled with the greensickness a very fine one o how he loves caesar caesar why he's the jupiter of men spake you of caesar how the nonpareil would you praise caesar say caesar go no further but he loves caesar best yet he loves antony hoo hearts tongues figures scribes bards poets cannot think speak cast write sing number hoo  his love to antony but as for caesar kneel down kneel down and wonder they are his shards and he their beetle so this is to horse adieu noble agrippa will caesar weep he were the worse for that were he a horse so is he being a man that year indeed he was troubled with a rheum what willingly he did confound he wailed believe 't till i wept too how now friend eros what man this is old what is the success then world thou hast a pair of chaps no more and throw between them all the food thou hast they'll grind the one the other where's antony our great navy's rigged 'twill be naught but let it be bring me to antony but why why why well is it is it well i could reply if we should serve with horse and mares together the horse were merely lost the mares would bear a soldier and his horse your presence needs must puzzle antony take from his heart take from his brain from 's time what should not then be spared he is already traduced for levity and 'tis said in rome that photinus an eunuch and your maids manage this war nay i have done here comes the emperor so hath my lord dared him to single fight your ships are not well manned your mariners are muleteers reapers people engrossed by swift impress in caesar's fleet are those that often have 'gainst pompey fought their ships are yare yours heavy no disgrace shall fall you for refusing him at sea being prepared for land most worthy sir you therein throw away the absolute soldiership you have by land distract your army which doth most consist of war marked footmen leave unexecuted your own renownèd knowledge quite forgo the way which promises assurance and give up yourself merely to chance and hazard from firm security naught naught all naught i can behold no longer th' antoniad the egyptian admiral with all their sixty fly and turn the rudder to see 't mine eyes are blasted what's thy passion how appears the fight that i beheld mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not endure a further view alack alack ay are you thereabouts why then goodnight indeed i'll yet follow the wounded chance of antony though my reason sits in the wind against me think and die antony only that would make his will lord of his reason what though you fled from that great face of war whose several ranges frighted each other why should he follow the itch of his affection should not then have nicked his captainship at such a point when half to half the world opposed he being the merèd question 'twas a shame no less than was his loss to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing yes like enough high battled caesar will unstate his happiness and be staged to th' show against a sworder i see men's judgments are a parcel of their fortunes and things outward do draw the inward quality after them to suffer all alike that he should dream knowing all measures the full caesar will answer his emptiness caesar thou hast subdued his judgment too mine honesty and i begin to square the loyalty well held to fools does make our faith mere folly yet he that can endure to follow with allegiance a fall'n lord does conquer him that did his master conquer and earns a place i' th' story he needs as many sir as caesar has or needs not us if caesar please our master will leap to be his friend for us you know whose he is we are and that is caesar's to be sure of that i will ask antony sir sir thou art so leaky that we must leave thee to thy sinking for thy dearest quit thee you will be whipped 'tis better playing with a lion's whelp than with an old one dying now he'll outstare the lightning to be furious is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood the dove will peck the estridge and i see still a diminution in our captain's brain restores his heart when valor preys on reason it eats the sword it fights with i will seek some way to leave him no he thinks being twenty times of better fortune he is twenty men to one i'll strike and cry take all 'tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots out of the mind to make his followers weep what mean you sir to give them this discomfort look they weep and i an ass am onion eyed for shame transform us not to women alexas did revolt and went to jewry on affairs of antony there did dissuade great herod to incline himself to caesar and leave his master antony for this pains caesar hath hanged him canidius and the rest that fell away have entertainment but no honorable trust i have done ill of which i do accuse myself so sorely that i will joy no more i give it you i am alone the villain of the earth and feel i am so most o antony thou mine of bounty how wouldst thou have paid my better service when my turpitude thou dost so crown with gold this blows my heart if swift thought break it not a swifter mean shall outstrike thought but thought will do 't i feel i fight against thee no i will go seek some ditch wherein to die the foul'st best fits my latter part of life o bear me witness night  be witness to me o thou blessèd moon when men revolted shall upon record bear hateful memory poor enobarbus did before thy face repent o sovereign mistress of true melancholy the poisonous damp of night dispunge upon me that life a very rebel to my will may hang no longer on me throw my heart against the flint and hardness of my fault which being dried with grief will break to powder and finish all foul thoughts o antony nobler than my revolt is infamous forgive me in thine own particular but let the world rank me in register a master leaver and a fugitive o antony o antony
