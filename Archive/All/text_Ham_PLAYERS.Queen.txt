so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count o'er ere love be done but woe is me you are so sick of late so far from cheer and from your former state that i distrust you yet though i distrust discomfort you my lord it nothing must for women fear too much even as they love and women's fear and love hold quantity in neither aught or in extremity now what my love is proof hath made you know and as my love is sized my fear is so where love is great the littlest doubts are fear where little fears grow great great love grows there o confound the rest such love must needs be treason in my breast in second husband let me be accurst none wed the second but who killed the first the instances that second marriage move are base respects of thrift but none of love a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed nor earth to me give food nor heaven light sport and repose lock from me day and night to desperation turn my trust and hope an anchor's cheer in prison be my scope each opposite that blanks the face of joy meet what i would have well and it destroy both here and hence pursue me lasting strife if once a widow ever i be wife sleep rock thy brain and never come mischance between us twain
