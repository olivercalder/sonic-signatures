if music be the food of love play on give me excess of it that surfeiting the appetite may sicken and so die that strain again it had a dying fall o it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound that breathes upon a bank of violets stealing and giving odor enough no more 'tis not so sweet now as it was before o spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou that notwithstanding thy capacity receiveth as the sea naught enters there of what validity and pitch soe'er but falls into abatement and low price even in a minute so full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical what curio why so i do the noblest that i have o when mine eyes did see olivia first methought she purged the air of pestilence that instant was i turned into a hart and my desires like fell and cruel hounds e'er since pursue me how now what news from her o she that hath a heart of that fine frame to pay this debt of love but to a brother how will she love when the rich golden shaft hath killed the flock of all affections else that live in her when liver brain and heart these sovereign thrones are all supplied and filled her sweet perfections with one self king away before me to sweet beds of flowers love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers who saw cesario ho stand you awhile aloof cesario thou know'st no less but all i have unclasped to thee the book even of my secret soul therefore good youth address thy gait unto her be not denied access stand at her doors and tell them there thy fixèd foot shall grow till thou have audience be clamorous and leap all civil bounds rather than make unprofited return o then unfold the passion of my love surprise her with discourse of my dear faith it shall become thee well to act my woes she will attend it better in thy youth than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect dear lad believe it for they shall yet belie thy happy years that say thou art a man diana's lip is not more smooth and rubious thy small pipe is as the maiden's organ shrill and sound and all is semblative a womans part i know thy constellation is right apt for this affair some four or five attend him all if you will for i myself am best when least in company prosper well in this and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord to call his fortunes thine give me some music now good morrow friends  now good cesario but that piece of song that old and antique song we heard last night methought it did relieve my passion much more than light airs and recollected terms of these most brisk and giddy pacèd times come but one verse who was it seek him out and play the tune the while come hither boy if ever thou shalt love in the sweet pangs of it remember me for such as i am all true lovers are unstaid and skittish in all motions else save in the constant image of the creature that is beloved how dost thou like this tune thou dost speak masterly my life upon 't young though thou art thine eye hath stayed upon some favor that it loves hath it not boy what kind of woman is 't she is not worth thee then what years i' faith too old by heaven let still the woman take an elder than herself so wears she to him so sways she level in her husband's heart for boy however we do praise ourselves our fancies are more giddy and unfirm more longing wavering sooner lost and worn than women's are then let thy love be younger than thyself or thy affection cannot hold the bent for women are as roses whose fair flower being once displayed doth fall that very hour o fellow come the song we had last night  mark it cesario it is old and plain the spinsters and the knitters in the sun and the free maids that weave their thread with bones do use to chant it it is silly sooth and dallies with the innocence of love like the old age ay prithee sing there's for thy pains i'll pay thy pleasure then give me now leave to leave thee let all the rest give place once more cesario get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty tell her my love more noble than the world prizes not quantity of dirty lands the parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her tell her i hold as giddily as fortune but 'tis that miracle and queen of gems that nature pranks her in attracts my soul i cannot be so answered there is no woman's sides can bide the beating of so strong a passion as love doth give my heart no woman's heart so big to hold so much they lack retention alas their love may be called appetite no motion of the liver but the palate that suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt but mine is all as hungry as the sea and can digest as much make no compare between that love a woman can bear me and that i owe olivia what dost thou know and what's her history but died thy sister of her love my boy ay that's the theme to her in haste give her this jewel say my love can give no place bide no denay belong you to the lady olivia friends i know thee well how dost thou my good fellow just the contrary the better for thy friends how can that be why this is excellent thou shalt not be the worse for me there's gold o you give me ill counsel well i will be so much a sinner to be a double dealer there's another you can fool no more money out of me at this throw if you will let your lady know i am here to speak with her and bring her along with you it may awake my bounty further that face of his i do remember well yet when i saw it last it was besmeared as black as vulcan in the smoke of war a baubling vessel was he captain of for shallow draught and bulk unprizable with which such scatheful grapple did he make with the most noble bottom of our fleet that very envy and the tongue of loss cried fame and honor on him what's the matter notable pirate thou saltwater thief what foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear hast made thine enemies when came he to this town here comes the countess now heaven walks on earth  but for thee fellow fellow thy words are madness three months this youth hath tended upon me  but more of that anon take him aside gracious olivia  still so cruel what to perverseness you uncivil lady to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars my soul the faithful'st off'rings have breathed out that e'er devotion tendered what shall i do why should i not had i the heart to do it like to th' egyptian thief at point of death kill what i love a savage jealousy that sometime savors nobly but hear me this since you to nonregardance cast my faith and that i partly know the instrument that screws me from my true place in your favor live you the marble breasted tyrant still but this your minion whom i know you love and whom by heaven i swear i tender dearly him will i tear out of that cruel eye where he sits crownèd in his master's spite  come boy with me my thoughts are ripe in mischief i'll sacrifice the lamb that i do love to spite a raven's heart within a dove come away husband her husband sirrah o thou dissembling cub what wilt thou be when time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case or will not else thy craft so quickly grow that thine own trip shall be thine overthrow farewell and take her but direct thy feet where thou and i henceforth may never meet my gentleman cesario how now gentleman how is 't with you one face one voice one habit and two persons a natural perspective that is and is not be not amazed right noble is his blood if this be so as yet the glass seems true i shall have share in this most happy wrack  boy thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me give me thy hand and let me see thee in thy woman's weeds this savors not much of distraction madam i am most apt t' embrace your offer your master quits you and for your service done him so much against the mettle of your sex so far beneath your soft and tender breeding and since you called me master for so long here is my hand you shall from this time be your master's mistress is this the madman pursue him and entreat him to a peace he hath not told us of the captain yet when that is known and golden time convents a solemn combination shall be made of our dear souls meantime sweet sister we will not part from hence cesario come for so you shall be while
