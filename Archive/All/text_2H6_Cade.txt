jurisdiction regal what canst thou answer to my majesty for giving up of normandy unto monsieur basimecu the dauphin of france be it known unto thee by these presence even the presence of lord mortimer that i am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such filth as thou art thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school and whereas before our forefathers had no other books but the score and the tally thou hast caused printing to be used and contrary to the king his crown and dignity thou hast built a paper mill it will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb and such abominable words as no christian ear can endure to hear thou hast appointed justices of peace to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer moreover thou hast put them in prison and because they could not read thou hast hanged them when indeed only for that cause they have been most worthy to live thou dost ride on a footcloth dost thou not marry thou oughtst not to let thy horse wear a cloak when honester men than thou go in their hose and doublets away with him away with him he speaks latin tut when struck'st thou one blow in the field give him a box o' th' ear and that will make 'em red again you shall have a hempen caudle then and the help of hatchet nay he nods at us as who should say i'll be even with you i'll see if his head will stand steadier on a pole or no take him away and behead him i feel remorse in myself with his words but i'll bridle it he shall die an it be but for pleading so well for his life away with him he has a familiar under his tongue he speaks not i' god's name go take him away i say and strike off his head presently and then break into his son in law's house sir james cromer and strike off his head and bring them both upon two poles hither away with him and do as i command you the proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head on his shoulders unless he pay me tribute there shall not a maid be married but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it men shall hold of me in capite and we charge and command that their wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell marry presently but is not this braver let them kiss one another for they loved well when they were alive now part them again lest they consult about the giving up of some more towns in france soldiers defer the spoil of the city until night for with these borne before us instead of maces will we ride through the streets and at every corner have them kiss away up fish street down saint magnus' corner kill and knock down throw them into thames what noise is this i hear dare any be so bold to sound retreat or parley when i command them kill what buckingham and clifford are you so brave and you base peasants do you believe him will you needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks hath my sword therefore broke through london gates that you should leave me at the white hart in southwark i thought you would never have given out these arms till you had recovered your ancient freedom but you are all recreants and dastards and delight to live in slavery to the nobility let them break your backs with burdens take your houses over your heads ravish your wives and daughters before your faces for me i will make shift for one and so god's curse light upon you all was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this multitude the name of henry the fifth hales them to an hundred mischiefs and makes them leave me desolate i see them lay their heads together to surprise me my sword make way for me for here is no staying in despite of the devils and hell have through the very middest of you and heavens and honor be witness that no want of resolution in me but only my followers' base and ignominious treasons makes me betake me to my heels fie on ambitions fie on myself that have a sword and yet am ready to famish these five days have i hid me in these woods and durst not peep out for all the country is laid for me but now am i so hungry that if i might have a lease of my life for a thousand years i could stay no longer wherefore o'er a brick wall have i climbed into this garden to see if i can eat grass or pick a sallet another while which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach this hot weather and i think this word sallet was born to do me good for many a time but for a sallet my brainpan had been cleft with a brown bill and many a time when i have been dry and bravely marching it hath served me instead of a quart pot to drink in and now the word sallet must serve me to feed on here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray for entering his fee simple without leave ah villain thou wilt betray me and get a thousand crowns of the king by carrying my head to him but i'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich and swallow my sword like a great pin ere thou and i part brave thee ay by the best blood that ever was broached and beard thee too look on me well i have eat no meat these five days yet come thou and thy five men and if i do not leave you all as dead as a doornail i pray god i may never eat grass more by my valor the most complete champion that ever i heard steel if thou turn the edge or cut not out the burly boned clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath i beseech god on my knees thou mayst be turned to hobnails o i am slain famine and no other hath slain me let ten thousand devils come against me and give me but the ten meals i have lost and i'd defy them all wither garden and be henceforth a burying place to all that do dwell in this house because the unconquered soul of cade is fled iden farewell and be proud of thy victory tell kent from me she hath lost her best man and exhort all the world to be cowards for i that never feared any am vanquished by famine not by valor
