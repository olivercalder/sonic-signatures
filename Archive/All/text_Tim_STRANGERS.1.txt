we know him for no less though we are but strangers to him but i can tell you one thing my lord and which i hear from common rumors now lord timon's happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from him do you observe this hostilius why this is the world's soul and just of the same piece is every flatterer's sport who can call him his friend that dips in the same dish for in my knowing timon has been this lord's father and kept his credit with his purse supported his estate nay timon's money has paid his men their wages he ne'er drinks but timon's silver treads upon his lip and yet o see the monstrousness of man when he looks out in an ungrateful shape  he does deny him in respect of his what charitable men afford to beggars for mine own part i never tasted timon in my life nor came any of his bounties over me to mark me for his friend yet i protest for his right noble mind illustrious virtue and honorable carriage had his necessity made use of me i would have put my wealth into donation and the best half should have returned to him so much i love his heart but i perceive men must learn now with pity to dispense for policy sits above conscience
