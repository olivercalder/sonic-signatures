ere i did approach i drew to part them in the instant came the fiery tybalt with his sword prepared which as he breathed defiance to my ears he swung about his head and cut the winds who nothing hurt withal hissed him in scorn while we were interchanging thrusts and blows came more and more and fought on part and part till the prince came who parted either part madam an hour before the worshiped sun peered forth the golden window of the east a troubled mind drove me to walk abroad where underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from this city side so early walking did i see your son towards him i made but he was 'ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood i measuring his affections by my own which then most sought where most might not be found being one too many by my weary self pursued my humor not pursuing his and gladly shunned who gladly fled from me my noble uncle do you know the cause have you importuned him by any means see where he comes so please you step

romeo's hand did slay  romeo that spoke him fair bid him bethink how nice the quarrel was and urged withal your high displeasure all this utterèd with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowed could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutio's breast who all as hot turns deadly point to point and with a martial scorn with one hand beats cold death aside and with the other sends it back to tybalt whose dexterity retorts it romeo he cries aloud hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue his agile arm beats down their fatal points and 'twixt them rushes underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled but by and by comes back to romeo who had but newly entertained revenge and to 't they go like lightning for ere i could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain and as he fell did romeo turn and fly this is the truth or let benvolio die
