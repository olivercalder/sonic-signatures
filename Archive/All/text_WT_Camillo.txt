i think this coming summer the king of sicilia means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him beseech you  you pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely sicilia cannot show himself over kind to bohemia they were trained together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society their encounters though not personal hath been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts letters loving embassies that they have seemed to be together though absent shook hands as over a vast and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds the heavens continue their loves i very well agree with you in the hopes of him it is a gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live ay my good lord you had much ado to make his anchor hold when you cast out it still came home he would not stay at your petitions made his business more material at the good queen's entreaty business my lord i think most understand bohemia stays here longer stays here longer to satisfy your highness and the entreaties of our most gracious mistress be it forbid my lord my gracious lord i may be negligent foolish and fearful in every one of these no man is free but that his negligence his folly fear among the infinite doings of the world sometime puts forth in your affairs my lord if ever i were willful negligent it was my folly if industriously i played the fool it was my negligence not weighing well the end if ever fearful to do a thing where i the issue doubted whereof the execution did cry out against the non performance 'twas a fear which oft infects the wisest these my lord are such allowed infirmities that honesty is never free of but beseech your grace be plainer with me let me know my trespass by its own visage if i then deny it 'tis none of mine i would not be a stander by to hear my sovereign mistress clouded so without my present vengeance taken 'shrew my heart you never spoke what did become you less than this which to reiterate were sin as deep as that though true good my lord be cured of this diseased opinion and betimes for 'tis most dangerous no no my lord who does infect her sir my lord i could do this and that with no rash potion but with a ling'ring dram that should not work maliciously like poison but i cannot believe this crack to be in my dread mistress so sovereignly being honorable i have loved thee  i must believe you sir i do and will fetch off bohemia for 't  provided that when he's removed your highness will take again your queen as yours at first even for your son's sake and thereby for sealing the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms known and allied to yours my lord go then and with a countenance as clear as friendship wears at feasts keep with bohemia and with your queen i am his cupbearer if from me he have wholesome beverage account me not your servant i'll do 't my lord o miserable lady but for me what case stand i in i must be the poisoner of good polixenes and my ground to do 't is the obedience to a master one who in rebellion with himself will have all that are his so too to do this deed promotion follows if i could find example of thousands that had struck anointed kings and flourished after i'd not do 't but since nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one let villainy itself forswear 't i must forsake the court to do 't or no is certain to me a breakneck happy star reign now here comes bohemia hail most royal sir none rare my lord i dare not know my lord

him that i think honorable therefore mark my counsel which must be e'en as swiftly followed as i mean to utter it or both yourself and me cry lost and so goodnight i am appointed him to murder you by the king he thinks nay with all confidence he swears as he had seen 't or been an instrument to vice you to 't that you have touched his queen forbiddenly swear his thought over by each particular star in heaven and by all their influences you may as well forbid the sea for to obey the moon as or by oath remove or counsel shake the fabric of his folly whose foundation is piled upon his faith and will continue the standing of his body i know not but i am sure 'tis safer to avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born if therefore you dare trust my honesty that lies enclos√®d in this trunk which you shall bear along impawned away tonight your followers i will whisper to the business and will by twos and threes at several posterns clear them o' th' city for myself i'll put my fortunes to your service which are here by this discovery lost be not uncertain for by the honor of my parents i have uttered truth which if you seek to prove i dare not stand by nor shall you be safer than one condemned by the king's own mouth thereon his execution sworn it is in mine authority to command the keys of all the posterns please your highness to take the urgent hour come sir away it is fifteen years since i saw my country though i have for the most part been aired abroad i desire to lay my bones there besides the penitent king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows i might be some allay or i o'erween to think so which is another spur to my departure sir it is three days since i saw the prince what his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but i have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared i have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage i willingly obey your command i should leave grazing were i of your flock and only live by gazing he tells her something that makes her blood look out good sooth she is the queen of curds and cream this shows a sound affection why how now father speak ere thou diest gracious my lord you know your father's temper at this time he will allow no speech which i do guess you do not purpose to him and as hardly will he endure your sight as yet i fear then till the fury of his highness settle come not before

yourself and your fair princess for so i see she must be 'fore leontes she shall be habited as it becomes the partner of your bed methinks i see leontes opening his free arms and weeping his welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness as 'twere i' th' father's person kisses the hands of your fresh princess o'er and o'er divides him 'twixt his unkindness and his kindness th' one he chides to hell and bids the other grow faster than thought or time sent by the king your father to greet him and to give him comforts sir the manner of your bearing towards him with what you as from your father shall deliver things known betwixt us three i'll write you down the which shall point you forth at every sitting what you must say that he shall not perceive but that you have your father's bosom there and speak his very heart a course more promising than a wild dedication of yourselves to unpathed waters undreamed shores most certain to miseries enough no hope to help you but as you shake off one to take another nothing so certain as your anchors who do their best office if they can but stay you where you'll be loath to be besides you know prosperity's the very bond of love whose fresh complexion and whose heart together affliction alters yea say you so there shall not at your father's house these seven years be born another such i cannot say 'tis pity she lacks instructions for she

bound wherein my hope is i shall so prevail to force him after in whose company i shall re view sicilia for whose sight i have a woman's longing the swifter speed the better my lord your sorrow was too sore laid on which sixteen winters cannot blow away so many summers dry scarce any joy did ever so long live no sorrow but killed itself much sooner she hangs about his neck if she pertain to life
