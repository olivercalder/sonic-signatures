i melancholy i am not melancholy get you home go you heard what this knave told me did you not do you think there is truth in them were they his men i like it never the better for that does he lie at the garter i do not misdoubt my wife but i would be loath to turn them together a man may be too confident i would have nothing lie on my head i cannot be thus satisfied good mine host o' th' garter a word with you none i protest but i'll give you a pottle of burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him my name is brook only for a jest though page be a secure fool and stands so firmly on his wife's frailty yet i cannot put off my opinion so easily she was in his company at page's house and what they made there i know not well i will look further into 't and i have a disguise to sound falstaff if i find her honest i lose not my labor if she be otherwise 'tis labor well bestowed god bless you sir i make bold to press with so little preparation upon you sir i am a gentleman that have spent much my name is brook good sir john i sue for yours not to charge you for i must let you understand i think myself in better plight for a lender than you are the which hath something emboldened me to this unseasoned intrusion for they say if money go before all ways do lie open troth and i have a bag of money here troubles me if you will help to bear it sir john take all or half for easing me of the carriage i will tell you sir if you will give me the hearing sir i hear you are a scholar i will be brief with you and you have been a man long known to me though i had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted with you i shall discover a thing to you wherein i must very much lay open mine own imperfection but good sir john as you have one eye upon my follies as you hear them unfolded turn another into the register of your own that i may pass with a reproof the easier sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender there is a gentlewoman in this town her husband's name is ford i have long loved her and i protest to you bestowed much on her followed her with a doting observance engrossed opportunities to meet her fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her not only bought many presents to give her but have given largely to many to know what she would have given briefly i have pursued her as love hath pursued me which hath been on the wing of all occasions but whatsoever i have merited either in my mind or in my means meed i am sure i have received none unless experience be a jewel that i have purchased at an infinite rate and that hath taught me to say this love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues never never like a fair house built on another man's ground so that i have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where i erected it when i have told you that i have told you all some say that though she appear honest to me yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her now sir john here is the heart of my purpose you are a gentleman of excellent breeding admirable discourse of great admittance authentic in your place and person generally allowed for your many warlike courtlike and learned preparations believe it for you know it there is money spend it spend it spend more spend all i have only give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this ford's wife use your art of wooing win her to consent to you if any man may you may as soon as any o understand my drift she dwells so securely on the excellency of her honor that the folly of my soul dares not present itself she is too bright to be looked against now could i come to her with any detection in my hand my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves i could drive her then from the ward of her purity her reputation her marriage vow and a thousand other her defenses which now are too too strongly embattled against me what say you to 't sir john o good sir want no money sir john you shall want none i am blessed in your acquaintance do you know ford sir i would you knew ford sir that you might avoid him if you saw him what a damned epicurean rascal is this my heart is ready to crack with impatience who says this is improvident jealousy my wife hath sent to him
