my lord i'll tell you that self bill is urged which in th' eleventh year of the last king's reign was like and had indeed against us passed but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question it must be thought on if it pass against us we lose the better half of our possession for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us being valued thus as much as would maintain to the king's honor full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand and two hundred good esquires and to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil a hundred almshouses right well supplied and to the coffers of the king besides a thousand pounds by th' year thus runs the bill 'twould drink the cup and all the king is full of grace and fair regard the courses of his youth promised it not the breath no sooner left his father's body but that his wildness mortified in him seemed to die too yea at that very moment consideration like an angel came and whipped th' offending adam out of him leaving his body as a paradise t' envelop and contain celestial spirits never was such a sudden scholar made never came reformation in a flood with such a heady currance scouring faults nor never hydra headed willfulness so soon did lose his seat and all at once as in this king hear him but reason in divinity and all admiring with an inward wish you would desire the king were made a prelate hear him debate of commonwealth affairs you would say it hath been all in all his study list his discourse of war and you shall hear a fearful battle rendered you in music turn him to any cause of policy the gordian knot of it he will unloose familiar as his garter that when he speaks the air a chartered libertine is still and the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears to steal his sweet and honeyed sentences so that the art and practic part of life must be the mistress to this theoric which is a wonder how his grace should glean it since his addiction was to courses vain his companies unlettered rude and shallow his hours filled up with riots banquets sports and never noted in him any study any retirement any sequestration from open haunts and popularity it must be so for miracles are ceased and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected he seems indifferent or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing th' exhibitors against us for i have made an offer to his majesty  upon our spiritual convocation and in regard of causes now in hand which i have opened to his grace at large as touching france to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal with good acceptance of his majesty  save that there was not time enough to hear as i perceived his grace would fain have done the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france derived from edward his great grandfather the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience and the hour i think is come to give him hearing is it four o'clock then go we in to know his embassy which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe yourselves your lives and services to this imperial throne there is no bar to make against your highness' claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant no woman shall succeed in salic land which salic land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salic is in germany between the floods of sala and of elbe where charles the great having subdued the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life established then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salic land which salic as i said 'twixt elbe and sala is at this day in germany called meissen then doth it well appear the salic law was not devisèd for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salic land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly supposed the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred twenty six and charles the great subdued the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five besides their writers say king pepin which deposèd childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france hugh capet also who usurped the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shows of truth though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught conveyed himself as th' heir to th' lady lingare daughter to charlemagne who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was reunited to the crown of france so that as clear as is the summer's sun king pepin's title and hugh capet's claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to hold in right and title of the female so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salic law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles usurped from you and your progenitors the sin upon my head dread sovereign for in the book of numbers is it writ when the man dies let the inheritance descend unto the daughter gracious lord stand for your own unwind your bloody flag look back into your mighty ancestors go my dread lord to your great grandsire's tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your great uncle's edward the black prince who on the french ground played a tragedy making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp forage in blood of french nobility o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by all out of work and cold for action o let their bodies follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors they of those marches gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers she hath been then more feared than harmed my liege for hear her but exampled by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edward's fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wrack and sumless treasuries therefore doth heaven divide the state of man in divers functions setting endeavor in continual motion to which is fixèd as an aim or butt obedience for so work the honeybees creatures that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom they have a king and officers of sorts where some like magistrates correct at home others like merchants venture trade abroad others like soldiers armèd in their stings make boot upon the summer's velvet buds which pillage they with merry march bring home to the tent royal of their emperor who busied in his majesty surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold the civil citizens kneading up the honey the poor mechanic porters crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate the sad eyed justice with his surly hum delivering o'er to executors pale the lazy yawning drone i this infer that many things having full reference to one consent may work contrariously as many arrows loosèd several ways come to one mark as many ways meet in one town as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea as many lines close in the dial's center so may a thousand actions once afoot end in one purpose and be all well borne without defeat therefore to france my liege divide your happy england into four whereof take you one quarter into france and you withal shall make all gallia shake if we with thrice such powers left at home cannot defend our own doors from the dog let us be worried and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy
