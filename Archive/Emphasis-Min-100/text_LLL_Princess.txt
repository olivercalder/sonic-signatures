you tell my worth than you much willing to be counted wise in spending your wit in the praise of mine but now to task the tasker good boyet you are not ignorant all telling fame doth noise abroad navarre hath made a vow till painful study shall outwear three years no woman may approach his silent court therefore to 's seemeth it a needful course before we enter his forbidden gates to know his pleasure and in that behalf bold of your worthiness we single you as our best moving fair solicitor tell him the daughter of the king of france on serious business craving quick dispatch importunes personal conference with his grace haste signify so much while we attend like humble visaged suitors his high will all pride is willing pride and yours is so who are the votaries my loving lords that are vow fellows with this virtuous duke know you the man some merry mocking lord belike is 't so such short lived wits do wither as they grow who are the rest god bless my ladies are they all in love that every one her own hath garnishèd with such bedecking ornaments of praise now what admittance lord fair i give you back again and welcome i have not yet the roof of this court is too high to be yours and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine i will be welcome then conduct me thither our lady help my lord he'll be forsworn why will shall break it will and nothing else were my lord so his ignorance were wise where now his knowledge must prove ignorance i hear your grace hath sworn out housekeeping 'tis deadly sin to keep that oath my lord and sin to break it but pardon me i am too sudden bold to teach a teacher ill beseemeth me vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming and suddenly resolve me in my suit you will the sooner that i were away for you'll prove perjured if you make me stay you do the king my father too much wrong and wrong the reputation of your name in so unseeming to confess receipt of that which hath so faithfully been paid we arrest your word  boyet you can

jangling but gentles agree this civil war of wits were much better used on navarre and his bookmen for here 'tis abused with what your reason come to our pavilion boyet is disposed was that the king that spurred his horse so hard against the steep uprising of the hill whoe'er he was he showed a mounting mind  well lords today we shall have our dispatch or saturday we will return to france  then forester my friend where is the bush that we must stand and play the murderer in i thank my beauty i am fair that shoot and thereupon thou speakst the fairest shoot what what first praise me and again say no o short lived pride not fair alack for woe nay never paint me now where fair is not praise cannot mend the brow here good my glass take this for telling true fair payment for foul words is more than due see see my beauty will be saved by merit o heresy in fair fit for these days a giving hand though foul shall have fair praise but come the bow now mercy goes to kill and shooting well is then accounted ill thus will i save my credit in the shoot not wounding pity would not let me do 't if wounding then it was to show my skill that more for praise than purpose meant to kill and out of question so it is sometimes glory grows guilty of detested crimes when for fame's sake for praise an outward part we bend to that the working of the heart as i for praise alone now seek to spill the poor deer's blood that my heart means no ill only for praise and praise we may afford to any lady that subdues a lord thou shalt know her fellow by the rest that have no heads the thickest and the tallest what's your will sir what's your will o thy letter thy letter he's a good friend of mine stand aside good bearer boyet you can carve break up this capon we will read it i swear break the neck

sent it and what is it anything like beauteous as ink a good conclusion a pox of that jest and i beshrew all shrows but katherine what was sent to you from fair dumaine did he not send you twain i think no less dost thou not wish in heart the chain were longer and the letter short we are wise girls to mock our lovers so none are so surely caught when they are catched as wit turned fool folly in wisdom hatched hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school and wit's own grace to grace a learnèd fool here comes boyet and mirth is in his face thy news boyet saint denis to saint cupid what are they that charge their breath against us say scout say but what but what come they to visit us and will they so the gallants shall be tasked for ladies we will every one be masked and not a man of them shall have the grace despite of suit to see a lady's face hold rosaline this favor thou shalt wear and then the king will court thee for his dear hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine so shall berowne take me for rosaline and change you favors too so shall your loves woo contrary deceived by these removes the effect of my intent is to cross theirs they do it but in mockery merriment and mock for mock is only my intent their several counsels they unbosom shall to loves mistook and so be mocked withal upon the next occasion that we meet with visages displayed to talk and greet no to the death we will not move a foot nor to their penned speech render we no grace but while 'tis spoke each turn away her face therefore i do it and i make no doubt the rest will ne'er come in if he be out there's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown to make theirs ours and ours none but our own so shall we stay mocking intended game and they well mocked depart away with shame honey and milk and sugar there is three seventh sweet adieu since you can cog i'll play no more with you let it not be sweet gall bitter twenty adieus my frozen muskovits  are these the breed of wits so wondered at o poverty in wit kingly poor flout will they not think you hang themselves tonight or ever but in vizards show their faces this pert berowne was out of count'nance quite berowne did swear himself out of all suit qualm perhaps go sickness as thou art and quick berowne hath plighted faith to me will they return how blow how blow speak to be understood avaunt perplexity what shall we do if they return in their own shapes to woo whip to our tents as roes runs o'er land fair in all hail is foul as i conceive then wish me better i will give you leave this field shall hold me and so hold your vow nor god nor i delights in perjured men you nickname virtue vice you should have spoke for virtue's office never breaks men's troth now by my maiden honor yet as pure as the unsullied lily i protest a world of torments though i should endure i would not yield to be your house's guest so much i hate a breaking cause to be of heavenly oaths vowed with integrity not so my lord it is not so i swear we have had pastimes here and pleasant game a mess of russians left us but of late ay in truth my lord trim gallants full of courtship and of state amazed my lord why looks your highness sad no they are free that gave these tokens to us the fairest is confession were not you here but even now disguised and were you well advised when you then were here what did you whisper in your lady's ear when she shall challenge this you will reject her peace peace forbear your oath once broke you force not to forswear i will and therefore keep it rosaline what did the russian whisper in your ear god give thee joy of him the noble lord most honorably doth uphold his word pardon me sir this jewel did she wear and lord berowne i thank him is my dear what will you have me or your pearl again nay my good lord let me o'errule you now that sport best pleases that doth least know how where zeal strives to content and the contents dies in the zeal of that which it presents their form confounded makes most form in mirth when great things laboring perish in their birth doth this man serve god he speaks not like a man of god his making great thanks great pompey the conqueror is dismayed proceed good alexander stand aside good pompey alas poor maccabaeus how hath he been baited speak brave hector we are much delighted welcome marcade but that thou interruptest our merriment dead for my life boyet prepare i will away tonight prepare i say i thank you gracious lords for all your fair endeavors and entreat out of a new sad soul that you vouchsafe in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide the liberal opposition of our spirits if overboldly we have borne ourselves in the converse of breath your gentleness was guilty of it farewell worthy lord a heavy heart bears not a humble tongue excuse me so coming too short of thanks for my great suit so easily obtained i understand you not my griefs are double we have received your letters full of love your favors the ambassadors of love and in our maiden council rated them at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy as bombast and as lining to the time but more devout than this in our respects have we not been and therefore met your loves in their own fashion like a merriment a time methinks too short to make a world without end bargain in no no my lord your grace is perjured much full of dear guiltiness and therefore this if for my love as there is no such cause  you will do aught this shall you do for me your oath i will not trust but go with speed to some forlorn and naked hermitage remote from all the pleasures of the world there stay until the twelve celestial signs have brought about the annual reckoning if this austere insociable life change not your offer made in heat of blood if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love but that it bear this trial and last love then at the expiration of the year come challenge me challenge me by these deserts and by this virgin palm now kissing thine i will be thine and till that instant shut my woeful self up in a mourning house raining the tears of lamentation for the remembrance of my father's death if this thou do deny let our hands part neither entitled in the other's heart ay sweet my lord and so i take my leave was not that hector
