so shaken as we are so wan with care find we a time for frighted peace to pant and breathe short winded accents of new broils to be commenced in strands afar remote no more the thirsty entrance of this soil shall daub her lips with her own children's blood no more shall trenching war channel her fields nor bruise her flow'rets with the armèd hoofs of hostile paces those opposèd eyes which like the meteors of a troubled heaven all of one nature of one substance bred did lately meet in the intestine shock and furious close of civil butchery shall now in mutual well beseeming ranks march all one way and be no more opposed against acquaintance kindred and allies the edge of war like an ill sheathèd knife no more shall cut his master therefore friends as far as to the sepulcher of christ  whose soldier now under whose blessèd cross we are impressèd and engaged to fight  forthwith a power of english shall we levy whose arms were molded in their mothers' womb to chase these pagans in those holy fields over whose acres walked those blessèd feet which fourteen hundred years ago were nailed for our advantage on the bitter cross but this our purpose now is twelve month old and bootless 'tis to tell you we will go therefor we meet not now then let me hear of you my gentle cousin westmoreland what yesternight our council did decree in forwarding this dear expedience it seems then that the tidings of this broil brake off our business for the holy land here is a dear a true industrious friend sir walter blunt new lighted from his horse stained with the variation of each soil betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news the earl of douglas is discomfited ten thousand bold scots two and twenty knights balked in their own blood did sir walter see on holmedon's plains of prisoners hotspur took mordake earl of fife and eldest son to beaten douglas and the earl of atholl of murray angus and menteith and is not this an honorable spoil a gallant prize ha cousin is it not yea there thou mak'st me sad and mak'st me sin in envy that my lord northumberland should be the father to so blest a son a son who is the theme of honor's tongue amongst a grove the very straightest plant who is sweet fortune's minion and her pride whilst i by looking on the praise of him see riot and dishonor stain the brow of my young harry o that it could be proved that some night tripping fairy had exchanged in cradle clothes our children where they lay and called mine percy his plantagenet then would i have his harry and he mine but let him from my thoughts what think you coz of this young percy's pride the prisoners which he in this adventure hath surprised to his own use he keeps and sends me word i shall have none but mordake earl of fife but i have sent for him to answer this and for this cause awhile we must neglect our holy purpose to jerusalem cousin on wednesday next our council we will hold at windsor so inform the lords but come yourself with speed to us again for more is to be said and to be done than out of anger can be utterèd my blood hath been too cold and temperate unapt to stir at these indignities and you have found me for accordingly you tread upon my patience but be sure i will from henceforth rather be myself mighty and to be feared than my condition which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down and therefore lost that title of respect which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud worcester get thee gone for i do see danger and disobedience in thine eye o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory and majesty might never yet endure the moody frontier of a servant brow you have good leave to leave us when we need your use and counsel we shall send for you you were about to speak why yet he doth deny his prisoners but with proviso and exception that we at our own charge shall ransom straight his brother in law the foolish mortimer who on my soul hath willfully betrayed the lives of those that he did lead to fight against that great magician damned glendower whose daughter as we hear that earl of march hath lately married shall our coffers then be emptied to redeem a traitor home shall we buy treason and indent with fears when they have lost and forfeited themselves no on the barren mountains let him starve for i shall never hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him he never did encounter with glendower i tell thee he durst as well have met the devil alone as owen glendower for an enemy art thou not ashamed but sirrah henceforth let me not hear you speak of mortimer send me your prisoners with the speediest means or you shall hear in such a kind from me as will displease you my lord northumberland we license your departure with your son  send us your prisoners or you will hear of it lords give us leave the prince of wales and i must have some private conference but be near at hand for we shall presently have need of you i know not whether god will have it so for some displeasing service i have done that in his secret doom out of my blood he'll breed revengement and a scourge for me but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only marked for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings tell me else could such inordinate and low desires such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts such barren pleasures rude society as thou art matched withal and grafted to accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry at thy affections which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors thy place in council thou hast rudely lost which by thy younger brother is supplied and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectation of thy time is ruined and the soul of every man prophetically do forethink thy fall had i so lavish of my presence been so common hackneyed in the eyes of men so stale and cheap to vulgar company opinion that did help me to the crown had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment a fellow of no mark nor likelihood by being seldom seen i could not stir but like a comet i was wondered at that men would tell their children this is he others would say where which is bolingbroke and then i stole all courtesy from heaven and dressed myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from men's hearts loud shouts and salutations from their mouths even in the presence of the crownèd king thus did i keep my person fresh and new my presence like a robe pontifical ne'er seen but wondered at and so my state seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity the skipping king he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state mingled his royalty with cap'ring fools had his great name profanèd with their scorns and gave his countenance against his name to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative grew a companion to the common streets enfeoffed himself to popularity that being daily swallowed by men's eyes they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little more than a little is by much too much so when he had occasion to be seen he was but as the cuckoo is in june heard not regarded seen but with such eyes as sick and blunted with community afford no extraordinary gaze such as is bent on sunlike majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes but rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down slept in his face and rendered such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries being with his presence glutted gorged and full and in that very line harry standest thou for thou hast lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is aweary of thy common sight save mine which hath desired to see thee more which now doth that i would not have it do make blind itself with foolish tenderness for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh and even as i was then is percy now now by my scepter and my soul to boot he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession for of no right nor color like to right he doth fill fields with harness in the realm turns head against the lion's armèd jaws and being no more in debt to years than thou leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms what never dying honor hath he got against renownèd douglas whose high deeds whose hot incursions and great name in arms holds from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ thrice hath this hotspur mars in swaddling clothes this infant warrior in his enterprises discomfited great douglas ta'en him once enlargèd him and made a friend of him to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne and what say you to this percy northumberland the archbishop's grace of york douglas mortimer capitulate against us and are up but wherefore do i tell these news to thee why harry do i tell thee of my foes which art my nearest and dearest enemy thou that art like enough through vassal fear base inclination and the start of spleen to fight against me under percy's pay to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns to show how much thou art degenerate a hundred thousand rebels die in this thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein how now good blunt thy looks are full of speed the earl of westmoreland set forth today with him my son lord john of lancaster for this advertisement is five days old  on wednesday next harry you shall set forward on thursday we ourselves will march our meeting is bridgenorth and harry you shall march through gloucestershire by which account our business valuèd some twelve days hence our general forces at bridgenorth shall meet our hands are full of business let's away advantage feeds him fat while men delay how bloodily the sun begins to peer above yon bulky hill the day looks pale at his distemp'rature then with the losers let it sympathize for nothing can seem foul to those that win how now my lord of worcester 'tis not well that you and i should meet upon such terms as now we meet you have deceived our trust and made us doff our easy robes of peace to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel this is not well my lord this is not well what say you to it will you again unknit this churlish knot of all abhorrèd war and move in that obedient orb again where you did give a fair and natural light and be no more an exhaled meteor a prodigy of fear and a portent of broachèd mischief to the unborn times you have not sought it how comes it then these things indeed you have articulate proclaimed at market crosses read in churches to face the garment of rebellion with some fine color that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation and never yet did insurrection want such water colors to impaint his cause nor moody beggars starving for a time of pellmell havoc and confusion and prince of wales so dare we venture thee albeit considerations infinite do make against it no good worcester no we love our people well even those we love that are misled upon your cousin's part and will they take the offer of our grace both he and they and you yea every man shall be my friend again and i'll be his so tell your cousin and bring me word what he will do but if he will not yield rebuke and dread correction wait on us and they shall do their office so begone we will not now be troubled with reply we offer fair take it advisedly hence therefore every leader to his charge for on their answer will we set on them and god befriend us as our cause is just i prithee harry withdraw thyself thou bleedest too much lord john of lancaster go you with him i will do so my lord of westmoreland lead him to his tent i saw him hold lord percy at the point with lustier maintenance than i did look for of such an ungrown warrior the king himself who douglas grieves at heart so many of his shadows thou hast met and not the very king i have two boys seek percy and thyself about the field but seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily i will assay thee and defend thyself stay and breathe awhile thou hast redeemed thy lost opinion and showed thou mak'st some tender of my life in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me make up to clifton i'll to sir nicholas gawsey thus ever did rebellion find rebuke  ill spirited worcester did not we send grace pardon and terms of love to all of you and wouldst thou turn our offers contrary misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust three knights upon our party slain today a noble earl and many a creature else had been alive this hour if like a christian thou hadst truly borne betwixt our armies true intelligence bear worcester to the death and vernon too other offenders we will pause upon how goes the field with all my heart then this remains that we divide our power you son john and my cousin westmoreland towards york shall bend you with your dearest speed to meet northumberland and the prelate scroop who as we hear are busily in arms myself and you son harry will towards wales to fight with glendower and the earl of march rebellion in this land shall lose his sway meeting the check of such another day and since this business so fair is done let us not leave till all our own be won
