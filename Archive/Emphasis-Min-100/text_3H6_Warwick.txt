i wonder how the king escaped our hands and so do i victorious prince of york before i see thee seated in that throne which now the house of lancaster usurps i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close this is the palace of the fearful king and this the regal seat possess it york for this is thine and not king henry's heirs' and when the king comes offer him no violence unless he seek to thrust you out perforce the bloody parliament shall this be called unless plantagenet duke of york be king and bashful henry deposed whose cowardice hath made us bywords to our enemies neither the king nor he that loves him best the proudest he that holds up lancaster dares stir a wing if warwick shake his bells i'll plant plantagenet root him up who dares resolve thee richard claim the english crown exeter thou art a traitor to the crown in following this usurping henry true clifford that's richard duke of york be duke of lancaster let him be king and warwick shall disprove it you forget that we are those which chased you from the field and slew your fathers and with colors spread marched through the city to the palace gates poor clifford how i scorn his worthless threats talk not of france sith thou hast lost it all plantagenet shall speak first hear him lords and be you silent and attentive too for he that interrupts him shall not live prove it henry and thou shalt be king suppose my lords he did it unconstrained think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown deposed he shall be in despite of all do right unto this princely duke of york or i will fill the house with armèd men and over the chair of state where now he sits write up his title with usurping blood what good is this to england and himself turn this way henry and regard them not why should you sigh my lord long live king henry plantagenet embrace him and i'll keep london with my soldiers how now fair lords what fare what news abroad ten days ago i drowned these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befall'n after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i then in london keeper of the king mustered my soldiers gathered flocks of friends marched toward saint albans to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertisèd that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henry's oath and your succession short tale to make we at saint albans met our battles joined and both sides fiercely fought but whether 'twas the coldness of the king who looked full gently on his warlike queen that robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether 'twas report of her success or more than common fear of clifford's rigor who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers' like the night owl's lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheered them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste posthaste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henry's head and wring the awful scepter from his fist were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague attend me lords the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many more proud birds have wrought the easy melting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enrollèd in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster their power i think is thirty thousand strong now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via to london will we march and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and fly no longer earl of march but duke of york the next degree is england's royal throne for king of england shalt thou be proclaimed in every borough as we pass along and he that throws not up his cap for joy shall for the fault make forfeit of his head king edward valiant richard montague stay we no longer dreaming of renown but sound the trumpets and about our task how now what news why then it sorts brave warriors let's away what sayst thou henry wilt thou yield the crown then 'twas my turn to fly and now 'tis thine 'twas not your valor clifford drove me thence if thou deny their blood upon thy head for york in justice puts his armor on forspent with toil as runners with a race i lay me down a little while to breathe for strokes received and many blows repaid have robbed my strong knit sinews of their strength and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile how now my lord what hap what hope of good then let the earth be drunken with our blood i'll kill my horse because i will not fly why stand we like soft hearted women here wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage and look upon as if the tragedy were played in jest by counterfeiting actors here on my knee i vow to god above i'll never pause again never stand still till either death hath closed these eyes of mine or fortune given me measure of revenge away away once more sweet lords farewell no 'tis impossible he should escape for though before his face i speak the words your brother richard marked him for the grave and wheresoe'er he is he's surely dead from off the gates of york fetch down the head your father's head which clifford placèd there instead whereof let this supply the room measure for measure must be answerèd i think his understanding is bereft  speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee  dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say clifford devise excuses for thy faults they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont ay but he's dead off with the traitor's head and rear it in the place your father's stands and now to london with triumphant march there to be crownèd england's royal king from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france and ask the lady bona for thy queen so shalt thou sinew both these lands together and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread the scattered foe that hopes to rise again for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears first will i see the coronation and then to brittany i'll cross the sea to effect this marriage so it please my lord tut that's a foolish observation richard be duke of gloucester now to london to see these honors in possession from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vowèd friend i come in kindness and unfeignèd love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to england's king in lawful marriage and gracious madam in our king's behalf i am commanded with your leave and favor humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereign's heart where fame late ent'ring at his heedful ears hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue injurious margaret because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more art prince than she is queen oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry the fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdom's worth can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king and i the house of york thereon i pawn my credit and mine honor the more that henry was unfortunate such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fixed in virtue's ground the leaves and fruit maintained with beauty's sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing nothing can he lose  and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better 'twere you troubled him than france mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edward's  no more my king for he dishonors me but most himself if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death did i let pass th' abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdoned at the last with shame shame on himself for my desert is honor and to repair my honor lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state so much his friend ay his unfeignèd friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers i'll undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war 'tis not his new made bride shall succor him and as for clarence as my letters tell me he's very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honor or than for strength and safety of our country and mine fair lady bona joins with yours tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i'll uncrown him ere 't be long there's thy reward be gone this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree i'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raised him to the crown and i'll be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henry's misery but seek revenge on edward's mockery trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us but see where somerset and clarence comes  speak suddenly my lords are we all friends then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawned an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edward's brother were but a feignèd friend to our proceedings but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in night's coverture thy brother being carelessly encamped his soldiers lurking in the town about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomed with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus' tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well covered with the night's black mantle at unawares may beat down edward's guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader why then let's on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends god and saint george this is his tent and see where stand his guard courage my masters honor now or never but follow me and edward shall be ours richard and hastings let them go here is the duke ay but the case is altered when you disgraced me in my embassade then i degraded you from being king and come now to create you duke of york alas how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassadors nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the people's welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies then for his mind be edward england's king but henry now shall wear the english crown and be true king indeed thou but the shadow  my lord of somerset at my request see that forthwith duke edward be conveyed unto my brother archbishop of york when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows i'll follow you and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him  now for awhile farewell good duke of york ay that's the first thing that we have to do to free king henry from imprisonment and see him seated in the regal throne your grace hath still been famed for virtuous and now may seem as wise as virtuous by spying and avoiding fortune's malice for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace for choosing me when clarence is in place and i choose clarence only for protector what answers clarence to his sovereign's will why then though loath yet must i be content we'll yoke together like a double shadow to henry's body and supply his place  i mean in bearing weight of government  while he enjoys the honor and his ease and clarence now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor and all his lands and goods be confiscate ay therein clarence shall not want his part what news my friend unsavory news but how made he escape my brother was too careless of his charge but let us hence my sovereign to provide a salve for any sore that may betide what counsel lords edward from belgia with hasty germans and blunt hollanders hath passed in safety through the narrow seas and with his troops doth march amain to london and many giddy people flock to him in warwickshire i have true hearted friends not mutinous in peace yet bold in war those will i muster up and thou son clarence shalt stir up in suffolk norfolk and in kent the knights and gentlemen to come with thee  thou brother montague in buckingham northampton and in leicestershire shalt find men well inclined to hear what thou command'st  and thou brave oxford wondrous well beloved in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends  my sovereign with the loving citizens like to his island girt in with the ocean or modest dian circled with her nymphs shall rest in london till we come to him fair lords take leave and stand not to reply  farewell my sovereign farewell sweet lords let's meet at coventry where is the post that came from valiant oxford  how far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow how far off is our brother montague where is the post that came from montague say somerville what says my loving son and by thy guess how nigh is clarence now then clarence is at hand i hear his drum who should that be belike unlooked for friends o unbid spite is sportful edward come where slept our scouts or how are they seduced that we could hear no news of his repair nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence confess who set thee up and plucked thee down call warwick patron and be penitent and thou shalt still remain the duke of york is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift 'twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother thou art no atlas for so great a weight and weakling warwick takes his gift again and henry is my king warwick his subject i had rather chop this hand off at a blow and with the other fling it at thy face than bear so low a sail to strike to thee o cheerful colors see where oxford comes o welcome oxford for we want thy help and lo where george of clarence sweeps along of force enough to bid his brother battle with whom an upright zeal to right prevails more than the nature of a brother's love  come clarence come thou wilt if warwick call o passing traitor perjured and unjust alas i am not cooped here for defense i will away towards barnet presently and bid thee battle edward if thou dar'st ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe and tell me who is victor york or warwick why ask i that my mangled body shows my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows that i must yield my body to the earth and by my fall the conquest to my foe thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle under whose shade the ramping lion slept whose top branch overpeered jove's spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind these eyes that now are dimmed with death's black veil have been as piercing as the midday sun to search the secret treasons of the world the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood were likened oft to kingly sepulchers for who lived king but i could dig his grave and who durst smile when warwick bent his brow lo now my glory smeared in dust and blood my parks my walks my manors that i had even now forsake me and of all my lands is nothing left me but my body's length why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust and live we how we can yet die we must why then i would not fly ah montague if thou be there sweet brother take my hand and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile thou lov'st me not for brother if thou didst thy tears would wash this cold congealèd blood that glues my lips and will not let me speak come quickly montague or i am dead sweet rest his soul fly lords and save yourselves for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven
