leave those woes alone which i alone am bound to underbear thou mayst thou shalt i will not go with thee i will instruct my sorrows to be proud for grief is proud and makes his owner stoop to me and to the state of my great grief let kings assemble for my grief 's so great that no supporter but the huge firm earth can hold it up here i and sorrows sit here is my throne bid kings come bow to it a wicked day and not a holy day what hath this day deserved what hath it done that it in golden letters should be set among the high tides in the calendar nay rather turn this day out of the week this day of shame oppression perjury or if it must stand still let wives with child pray that their burdens may not fall this day lest that their hopes prodigiously be crossed but on this day let seamen fear no wrack no bargains break that are not this day made this day all things begun come to ill end yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change you have beguiled me with a counterfeit resembling majesty which being touched and tried proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn you came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood but now in arms you strengthen it with yours the grappling vigor and rough frown of war is cold in amity and painted peace and our oppression hath made up this league arm arm you heavens against these perjured kings a widow cries be husband to me god let not the hours of this ungodly day wear out the days in peace but ere sunset set armèd discord 'twixt these perjured kings hear me o hear me war war no peace peace is to me a war o limoges o austria thou dost shame that bloody spoil thou slave thou wretch thou coward thou little valiant great in villainy thou ever strong upon the stronger side thou fortune's champion that dost never fight but when her humorous ladyship is by to teach thee safety thou art perjured too and sooth'st up greatness what a fool art thou a ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear upon my party thou cold blooded slave hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side been sworn my soldier bidding me depend upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength and dost thou now fall over to my foes thou wear a lion's hide doff it for shame and hang a calfskin on those recreant limbs o lawful let it be that i have room with rome to curse awhile good father cardinal cry thou amen to my keen curses for without my wrong there is no tongue hath power to curse him right and for mine too when law can do no right let it be lawful that law bar no wrong law cannot give my child his kingdom here for he that holds his kingdom holds the law therefore since law itself is perfect wrong how can the law forbid my tongue to curse look to that devil lest that france repent and by disjoining hands hell lose a soul what should he say but as the cardinal o louis stand fast the devil tempts thee here in likeness of a new untrimmèd bride o if thou grant my need which only lives but by the death of faith that need must needs infer this principle that faith would live again by death of need o then tread down my need and faith mounts up keep my need up and faith is trodden down o be removed from him and answer well o upon my knee made hard with kneeling i do pray to thee thou virtuous dauphin alter not the doom forethought by heaven that which upholdeth him that thee upholds his honor o thine honor louis thine honor o fair return of banished majesty lo now now see the issue of your peace no i defy all counsel all redress but that which ends all counsel true redress death death o amiable lovely death thou odoriferous stench sound rottenness arise forth from the couch of lasting night thou hate and terror to prosperity and i will kiss thy detestable bones and put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows and ring these fingers with thy household worms and stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust and be a carrion monster like thyself come grin on me and i will think thou smil'st and buss thee as thy wife misery's love o come to me no no i will not having breath to cry o that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth then with a passion would i shake the world and rouse from sleep that fell anatomy which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice which scorns a modern invocation thou art not holy to belie me so i am not mad this hair i tear is mine my name is constance i was geoffrey's wife young arthur is my son and he is lost i am not mad i would to heaven i were for then 'tis like i should forget myself o if i could what grief should i forget preach some philosophy to make me mad and thou shalt be canonized cardinal for being not mad but sensible of grief my reasonable part produces reason how i may be delivered of these woes and teaches me to kill or hang myself if i were mad i should forget my son or madly think a babe of clouts were he i am not mad too well too well i feel the different plague of each calamity to england if you will yes that i will and wherefore will i do it i tore them from their bonds and cried aloud o that these hands could so redeem my son as they have given these hairs their liberty but now i envy at their liberty and will again commit them to their bonds because my poor child is a prisoner and father cardinal i have heard you say that we shall see and know our friends in heaven if that be true i shall see my boy again for since the birth of cain the first male child to him that did but yesterday suspire there was not such a gracious creature born but now will canker sorrow eat my bud and chase the native beauty from his cheek and he will look as hollow as a ghost as dim and meager as an ague's fit and so he'll die and rising so again when i shall meet him in the court of heaven i shall not know him therefore never never must i behold my pretty arthur more he talks to me that never had a son grief fills the room up of my absent child lies in his bed walks up and down with me puts on his pretty looks repeats his words remembers me of all his gracious parts stuffs out his vacant garments with his form then have i reason to be fond of grief fare you well had you such a loss as i i could give better comfort than you do i will not keep this form upon my head when there is such disorder in my wit o lord my boy my arthur my fair son my life my joy my food my all the world my widow comfort and my sorrows' cure
