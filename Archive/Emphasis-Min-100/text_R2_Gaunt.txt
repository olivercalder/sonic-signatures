i have my liege as near as i could sift him on that argument on some apparent danger seen in him aimed at your highness no inveterate malice to be a make peace shall become my age  throw down my son the duke of norfolk's gage when harry when obedience bids i should not bid again alas the part i had in woodstock's blood doth more solicit me than your exclaims to stir against the butchers of his life but since correction lieth in those hands which made the fault that we cannot correct put we our quarrel to the will of heaven who when they see the hours ripe on earth will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads god's is the quarrel for god's substitute his deputy anointed in his sight hath caused his death the which if wrongfully let heaven revenge for i may never lift an angry arm against his minister to god the widow's champion and defense sister farewell i must to coventry as much good stay with thee as go with me god in thy good cause make thee prosperous be swift like lightning in the execution and let thy blows doubly redoubled fall like amazing thunder on the casque of thy adverse pernicious enemy rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live i thank my liege that in regard of me he shortens four years of my son's exile but little vantage shall i reap thereby for ere the six years that he hath to spend can change their moons and bring their times about my oil dried lamp and time bewasted light shall be extinct with age and endless night my inch of taper will be burnt and done and blindfold death not let me see my son but not a minute king that thou canst give shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow thou canst help time to furrow me with age but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage thy word is current with him for my death but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour you urged me as a judge but i had rather you would have bid me argue like a father o had it been a stranger not my child to smooth his fault i should have been more mild a partial slander sought i to avoid and in the sentence my own life destroyed alas i looked when some of you should say i was too strict to make mine own away but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue against my will to do myself this wrong o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words that thou returnest no greeting to thy friends thy grief is but thy absence for a time what is six winters they are quickly gone call it a travel that thou tak'st for pleasure the sullen passage of thy weary steps esteem as foil wherein thou art to set the precious jewel of thy home return all places that the eye of heaven visits are to a wise man ports and happy havens teach thy necessity to reason thus there is no virtue like necessity think not the king did banish thee but thou the king woe doth the heavier sit where it perceives it is but faintly borne go say i sent thee forth to purchase honor and not the king exiled thee or suppose devouring pestilence hangs in our air and thou art flying to a fresher clime look what thy soul holds dear imagine it to lie that way thou goest not whence thou com'st suppose the singing birds musicians the grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strewed the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more than a delightful measure or a dance for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite the man that mocks at it and sets it light come come my son i'll bring thee on thy way had i thy youth and cause i would not stay will the king come that i may breathe my last in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth o but they say the tongues of dying men enforce attention like deep harmony where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain he that no more must say is listened more than they whom youth and ease have taught to gloze more are men's ends marked than their lives before the setting sun and music at the close as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last writ in remembrance more than things long past though richard my life's counsel would not hear my death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear methinks i am a prophet new inspired and thus expiring do foretell of him his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last for violent fires soon burn out themselves small showers last long but sudden storms are short he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder light vanity insatiate cormorant consuming means soon preys upon itself this royal throne of kings this sceptered isle this earth of majesty this seat of mars this other eden demi paradise this fortress built by nature for herself against infection and the hand of war this happy breed of men this little world this precious stone set in the silver sea which serves it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensive to a house against the envy of less happier lands this blessèd plot this earth this realm this england this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings feared by their breed and famous by their birth renownèd for their deeds as far from home for christian service and true chivalry as is the sepulcher in stubborn jewry of the world's ransom blessèd mary's son this land of such dear souls this dear dear land dear for her reputation through the world is now leased out i die pronouncing it  like to a tenement or pelting farm england bound in with the triumphant sea whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege of wat'ry neptune is now bound in with shame with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds that england that was wont to conquer others hath made a shameful conquest of itself ah would the scandal vanish with my life how happy then were my ensuing death o how that name befits my composition old gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old within me grief hath kept a tedious fast and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt for sleeping england long time have i watched watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt the pleasure that some fathers feed upon is my strict fast i mean my children's looks  and therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt gaunt am i for the grave gaunt as a grave whose hollow womb inherits naught but bones no misery makes sport to mock itself since thou dost seek to kill my name in me i mock my name great king to flatter thee no no men

destroy his sons from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame deposing thee before thou wert possessed which art possessed now to depose thyself why cousin wert thou regent of the world it were a shame to let this land by lease but for thy world enjoying but this land is it not more than shame to shame it so landlord of england art thou now not king thy state of law is bondslave to the law and
