sir proteus 'save you saw you my master twenty to one then he is shipped already and i have played the sheep in losing him you conclude that my master is a shepherd then and i a sheep why then my horns are his horns whether i wake or sleep this proves me still a sheep nay that i can deny by a circumstance the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the shepherd but i seek my master and my master seeks not me therefore i am no sheep such another proof will make me cry baa ay sir i a lost mutton gave your letter to her a laced mutton and she a laced mutton gave me a lost mutton nothing for my labor if the ground be overcharged you were best stick her nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter from a pound to a pin fold it over and over 'tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover ay you mistook sir i say she did nod and you ask me if she did nod and i say ay now you have taken the pains to set it together take it for your pains well i perceive i must be fain to bear with you marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing but the word noddy for my pains and yet it cannot overtake your slow purse open your purse that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered truly sir i think you'll hardly win her sir i could perceive nothing at all from her no not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter and being so hard to me that brought your mind i fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your mind give her no token but stones for she's as hard as steel no not so much as take this for thy pains to testify your bounty i thank you you have testerned me in requital whereof henceforth carry your letters yourself and so sir i'll commend you to my master sir your glove why then this may be yours for this is but one madam sylvia madam sylvia she is not within hearing sir your worship sir or else i mistook and yet i was last chidden for being too slow she that your worship loves marry by these special marks first you have learned like sir proteus to wreathe your arms like a malcontent to relish a love song like a robin redbreast to walk alone like one that had the pestilence to sigh like a schoolboy that had lost his abc to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam to fast like one that takes diet to watch like one that fears robbing to speak puling like a beggar at hallowmas you were wont when you laughed to crow like a cock when you walked to walk like one of the lions when you fasted it was presently after dinner when you looked sadly it was for want of money and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress that when i look on you i can hardly think you my master they are all perceived without you without you nay that's certain for without you were so simple none else would but you are so without these follies that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady she that you gaze on so as she sits at supper why sir i know her not is she not hard favored sir sir i know that well enough that she is not so fair as of you well favored that's because the one is painted and the other out of all count marry sir so painted to make her fair that no man counts of her beauty you never saw her since she was deformed ever since you loved her if you love her you cannot see her because love is blind o that you had mine eyes or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at sir proteus for going ungartered your own present folly and her passing deformity for he being in love could not see to garter his hose and you being in love cannot see to put on your hose true sir i was in love with my bed i thank you you swinged me for my love which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours i would you were set so your affection would cease and have you are they not lamely writ o excellent motion o exceeding puppet now will he interpret to her o give ye good ev'n here's a million of manners he should give her interest and she gives it him and yet you will and yet another yet o jest unseen inscrutable invisible as a nose on a man's face or a weathercock on a steeple my master sues to her and she hath taught her suitor he being her pupil to become her tutor o excellent device was there ever heard a better that my master being scribe to himself should write the letter nay i was rhyming 'tis you that have the reason to be a spokesman from madam sylvia to yourself why she woos you by a figure by a letter i should say what need she when she hath made you write to yourself why do you not perceive the jest no believing you indeed sir but did you perceive her earnest why she hath given you a letter and that letter hath she delivered and there an end i'll warrant you 'tis as well for often have you writ to her and she in modesty or else for want of idle time could not again reply or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover all this i speak in print for in print i found it why muse you sir 'tis dinnertime ay but hearken sir though the chameleon love can feed on the air i am one that am nourished by my victuals and would fain have meat o be not like your mistress be moved be moved master sir thurio frowns on you not of you 'twere good you knocked him lance by mine honesty welcome to padua come on you madcap i'll to the alehouse with you presently where for one shot of five pence thou shalt have five thousand welcomes but sirrah how did thy master part with madam julia but shall she marry him how then shall he marry her what are they broken why then how stands the matter with them what an ass art thou i understand thee
