believe it sir i have seen him in britain he was then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of but i could then have looked on him without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items this matter of marrying his king's daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him i doubt not a great deal from the matter ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colors are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality but how comes it he is to sojourn with you how creeps acquaintance can we with manners ask what was the difference that lady is not now living or this gentleman's opinion by this worn out you must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of italy as fair and as good a kind of hand in hand comparison had been something too fair and too good for any lady in britain if she went before others i have seen as that diamond of yours outlusters many i have beheld i could not but believe she excelled many but i have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the lady what do you esteem it at either your unparagoned mistress is dead or she's outprized by a trifle which the gods have given you you may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighboring ponds your ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplished courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last with five times so much conversation i should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion o'ervalues it something but i make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offense herein too i durst attempt it against any lady in the world what's that would i had put my estate and my neighbor's on th' approbation of what i have spoke yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and i will bring from thence that honor of hers which you imagine so reserved you are a friend and therein the wiser if you buy ladies' flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting but i see you have some religion in you that you fear i am the master of my speeches and would undergo what's spoken i swear by the gods it is one if i bring you no sufficient testimony that i have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too if i come off and leave her in such honor as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided i have your commendation for my more free entertainment your hand a covenant we will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve i will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded change you madam the worthy leonatus is in safety and greets your highness dearly all of her that is out of door most rich if she be furnished with a mind so rare she is alone th' arabian bird and i have lost the wager boldness be my friend arm me audacity from head to foot or like the parthian i shall flying fight  rather directly fly thanks fairest lady  what are men mad hath nature given them eyes to see this vaulted arch and the rich crop of sea and land which can distinguish 'twixt the fiery orbs above and the twinned stones upon the numbered beach and can we not partition make with spectacles so precious 'twixt fair and foul it cannot be i' th' eye for apes and monkeys 'twixt two such shes would chatter this way and contemn with mows the other nor i' th' judgment for idiots in this case of favor would be wisely definite nor i' th' appetite  sluttery to such neat excellence opposed should make desire vomit emptiness not so allured to feed the cloyèd will that satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub both filled and running ravening first the lamb longs after for the garbage thanks madam well beseech you sir desire my man's abode where i did leave him he's strange and peevish well madam exceeding pleasant none a stranger there so merry and so gamesome he is called the briton reveler i never saw him sad there is a frenchman his companion one an eminent monsieur that it seems much loves a gallian girl at home he furnaces the thick sighs from him whiles the jolly briton  your lord i mean laughs from 's free lungs cries o can my sides hold to think that man who knows by history report or his own proof what woman is yea what she cannot choose but must be will 's free hours languish for assurèd bondage ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter it is a recreation to be by and hear him mock the frenchman but heavens know some men are much to blame not he but yet heaven's bounty towards him might be used more thankfully in himself 'tis much in you which i account his beyond all talents whilst i am bound to wonder i am bound to pity too two creatures heartily lamentable what to hide me from the radiant sun and solace i' th' dungeon by a snuff that others do  i was about to say enjoy your but it is an office of the gods to venge it not mine to speak on 't had i this cheek to bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch whose every touch would force the feeler's soul to th' oath of loyalty this object which takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye fixing it only here should i damned then slaver with lips as common as the stairs that mount the capitol join gripes with hands made hard with hourly falsehood falsehood as with labor then by peeping in an eye base and illustrous as the smoky light that's fed with stinking tallow it were fit that all the plagues of hell should at one time encounter such revolt and himself not i inclined to this intelligence pronounce the beggary of his change but 'tis your graces that from my mutest conscience to my tongue charms this report out o dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart with pity that doth make me sick a lady so fair and fastened to an empery would make the great'st king double to be partnered with tomboys hired with that self exhibition which your own coffers yield with diseased ventures that play with all infirmities for gold which rottenness can lend nature such boiled stuff as well might poison poison be revenged or she that bore you was no queen and you recoil from your great stock should he make me live like diana's priest betwixt cold sheets whiles he is vaulting variable ramps in your despite upon your purse revenge it i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure more noble than that runagate to your bed and will continue fast to your affection still close as sure let me my service tender on your lips o happy leonatus i may say the credit that thy lady hath of thee deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness her assured credit blessèd live you long a lady to the worthiest sir that ever country called his and you his mistress only for the most worthiest fit give me your pardon i have spoke this to know if your affiance were deeply rooted and shall make your lord that which he is new o'er and he is one the truest mannered such a holy witch that he enchants societies into him half all men's hearts are his he sits 'mongst men like a descended god he hath a kind of honor sets him off more than a mortal seeming be not angry most mighty princess that i have adventured to try your taking of a false report which hath honored with confirmation your great judgment in the election of a sir so rare which you know cannot err the love i bear him made me to fan you thus but the gods made you unlike all others chaffless pray your pardon my humble thanks i had almost forgot t' entreat your grace but in a small request and yet of moment too for it concerns your lord myself and other noble friends are partners in the business some dozen romans of us and your lord  the best feather of our wing have mingled sums to buy a present for the emperor which i the factor for the rest have done in france 'tis plate of rare device and jewels of rich and exquisite form their values great and i am something curious being strange to have them in safe stowage may it please you to take them in protection they are in a trunk attended by my men i will make bold to send them to you only for this night i must aboard tomorrow yes i beseech or i shall short my word by length'ning my return from gallia i crossed the seas on purpose and on promise to see your grace o i must madam therefore i shall beseech you if you please to greet your lord with writing do 't tonight i have outstood my time which is material to th' tender of our present the crickets sing and man's o'erlabored sense repairs itself by rest our tarquin thus did softly press the rushes ere he wakened the chastity he wounded cytherea how bravely thou becom'st thy bed fresh lily and whiter than the sheets that i might touch but kiss one kiss rubies unparagoned how dearly they do 't 'tis her breathing that perfumes the chamber thus the flame o' th' taper bows toward her and would underpeep her lids to see th' enclosèd lights now canopied under these windows white and azure laced with blue of heaven's own tinct but my design to note the chamber i will write all down such and such pictures there the window such th' adornment of her bed the arras figures why such and such and the contents o' th' story ah but some natural notes about her body above ten thousand meaner movables would testify t' enrich mine inventory o sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her and be her sense but as a monument thus in a chapel lyingcome off come off as slippery as the gordian knot was hard 'tis mine and this will witness outwardly as strongly as the conscience does within to th' madding of her lord on her left breast a mole cinque spotted like the crimson drops i' th' bottom of a cowslip here's a voucher stronger than ever law could make this secret will force him think i have picked the lock and ta'en the treasure of her honor no more to what end why should i write this down that's riveted screwed to my memory she hath been reading late the tale of tereus here the leaf's turned down where philomel gave up i have enough to th' trunk again and shut the spring of it swift swift you dragons of the night that dawning may bare the raven's eye i lodge in fear though this a heavenly angel hell is here one two three time time your lady is one of the fairest that i have looked upon here are letters for you 'tis very like he was expected then but not approached if i have lost it i should have lost the worth of it in gold i'll make a journey twice as far t' enjoy a second night of such sweet shortness which was mine in britain for the ring is won not a whit your lady being so easy good sir we must if you keep covenant had i not brought the knowledge of your mistress home i grant we were to question farther but i now profess myself the winner of her honor together with your ring and not the wronger of her or you having proceeded but by both your wills sir my circumstances being so near the truth as i will make them must first induce you to believe whose strength i will confirm with oath which i doubt not you'll give me leave to spare when you shall find you need it not first her bedchamber  where i confess i slept not but profess had that was well worth watching it was hanged with tapestry of silk and silver the story proud cleopatra when she met her roman and cydnus swelled above the banks or for the press of boats or pride a piece of work so bravely done so rich that it did strive in workmanship and value which i wondered could be so rarely and exactly wrought since the true life on 't was  more particulars must justify my knowledge the chimney is south the chamber and the chimney piece chaste dian bathing never saw i figures so likely to report themselves the cutter was as another nature dumb outwent her motion and breath left out the roof o' th' chamber with golden cherubins is fretted her andirons  i had forgot them were two winking cupids of silver each on one foot standing nicely depending on their brands then if you can be pale i beg but leave to air this jewel see  and now 'tis up again it must be married to that your diamond i'll keep them sir i thank her that she stripped it from her arm i see her yet her pretty action did outsell her gift and yet enriched it too she gave it me and said she prized it once she writes so to you doth she by jupiter i had it from her arm if you seek for further satisfying under her breast worthy the pressing lies a mole right proud of that most delicate lodging by my life i kissed it and it gave me present hunger to feed again though full you do remember this stain upon her will you hear more i'll be sworn  i'll deny nothing with all my heart the heaviness and guilt within my bosom takes off my manhood i have belied a lady the princess of this country and the air on 't revengingly enfeebles me or could this carl a very drudge of nature's have subdued me in my profession knighthoods and honors borne as i wear mine are titles but of scorn if that thy gentry britain go before this lout as he exceeds our lords the odds is that we scarce are men and you are gods 'tis their fresh supplies thou 'lt torture me to leave unspoken that which to be spoke would torture thee i am glad to be constrained to utter that which torments me to conceal by villainy i got this ring 'twas leonatus' jewel whom thou didst banish and which more may grieve thee as it doth me a nobler sir ne'er lived 'twixt sky and ground wilt thou hear more my lord that paragon thy daughter for whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits quail to remember give me leave i faint upon a time unhappy was the clock that struck the hour it was in rome accursed the mansion where 'twas at a feast o would our viands had been poisoned or at least those which i heaved to head the good posthumus  what should i say he was too good to be where ill men were and was the best of all amongst the rar'st of good ones sitting sadly hearing us praise our loves of italy for beauty that made barren the swelled boast of him that best could speak for feature laming the shrine of venus or straight pight minerva postures beyond brief nature for condition a shop of all the qualities that man loves woman for besides that hook of wiving fairness which strikes the eye  all too soon i shall unless thou wouldst grieve quickly this posthumus most like a noble lord in love and one that had a royal lover took his hint and not dispraising whom we praised therein he was as calm as virtue he began his mistress' picture which by his tongue being made and then a mind put in 't either our brags were cracked of kitchen trulls or his description proved us unspeaking sots your daughter's chastity there it begins he spake of her as dian had hot dreams and she alone were cold whereat i wretch made scruple of his praise and wagered with him pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore upon his honored finger to attain in suit the place of 's bed and win this ring by hers and mine adultery he true knight no lesser of her honor confident than i did truly find her stakes this ring and would so had it been a carbuncle of phoebus' wheel and might so safely had it been all the worth of 's car away to britain post i in this design well may you sir remember me at court where i was taught of your chaste daughter the wide difference 'twixt amorous and villainous being thus quenched of hope not longing mine italian brain gan in your duller britain operate most vilely for my vantage excellent and to be brief my practice so prevailed that i returned with simular proof enough to make the noble leonatus mad by wounding his belief in her renown with tokens thus and thus averring notes of chamber hanging pictures this her bracelet  o cunning how i got it nay some marks of secret on her person that he could not but think her bond of chastity quite cracked i having ta'en the forfeit whereupon  methinks i see him now  i am down again but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee as then your force did take that life beseech you which i so often owe but your ring first and here the bracelet of the truest princess that ever swore her faith
