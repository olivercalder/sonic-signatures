how now prince troilus wherefore not afield that paris is return√®d home and hurt troilus by menelaus hark what good sport is out of town today in all swift haste is this great agamemnon's tent i pray you may one that is a herald and a prince do a fair message to his kingly eyes fair leave and large security how may a stranger to those most imperial looks know them from eyes of other mortals ay i ask that i might waken reverence and bid the cheek be ready with a blush modest as morning when she coldly eyes the youthful phoebus which is that god in office guiding men which is the high and mighty agamemnon courtiers as free as debonair unarmed as bending angels that's their fame in peace but when they would seem soldiers they have galls good arms strong joints true swords and great jove's accord  nothing so full of heart but peace aeneas peace trojan lay thy finger on thy lips the worthiness of praise distains his worth if that the praised himself bring the praise forth but what the repining enemy commends that breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends ay greek that is my name sir pardon 'tis for agamemnon's ears nor i from troy come not to whisper with him i bring a trumpet to awake his ear to set his sense on the attentive bent and then to speak trumpet blow loud send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents and every greek of mettle let him know what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud we have great agamemnon here in troy a prince called hector priam is his father  who in this dull and long continued truce is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet and to this purpose speak kings princes lords if there be one among the fair'st of greece that holds his honor higher than his ease that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril that knows his valor and knows not his fear that loves his mistress more than in confession with truant vows to her own lips he loves and dare avow her beauty and her worth in other arms than hers to him this challenge hector in view of trojans and of greeks shall make it good or do his best to do it he hath a lady wiser fairer truer than ever greek did couple in his arms and will tomorrow with his trumpet call midway between your tents and walls of troy to rouse a grecian that is true in love if any come hector shall honor him if none he'll say in troy when he retires the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth the splinter of a lance even so much now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth is the prince there in person  had i so good occasion to lie long as you prince paris nothing but heavenly business should rob my bedmate of my company health to you valiant sir during all question of the gentle truce but when i meet you armed as black defiance as heart can think or courage execute and thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly with his face backward in human gentleness welcome to troy now by anchises' life welcome indeed by venus' hand i swear no man alive can love in such a sort the thing he means to kill more excellently we know each other well i was sent for to the king but why i know not that i assure you troilus had rather troy were borne to greece than cressid borne from troy good morrow all good morrow lord good morrow is not prince troilus here come he is here my lord do not deny him it doth import him much to speak with me ho nay then come come you'll do him wrong ere you are ware you'll be so true to him to be false to him do not you know of him but yet go fetch him hither go my lord i scarce have leisure to salute you my matter is so rash there is at hand paris your brother and deiphobus the grecian diomed and our antenor delivered to us and for him forthwith ere the first sacrifice within this hour we must give up to diomedes' hand the lady cressida by priam and the general state of troy they are at hand and ready to effect it good good my lord the secrets of nature have not more gift in taciturnity my lord is the lady ready nay good my lord  how have we spent this morning the prince must think me tardy and remiss that swore to ride before him to the field yea with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity let us address to tend on hector's heels the glory of our troy doth this day lie on his fair worth and single chivalry hail all the state of greece what shall be done to him that victory commands or do you purpose a victor shall be known will you the knights shall to the edge of all extremity pursue each other or shall they be divided by any voice or order of the field hector bade ask he cares not he'll obey conditions if not achilles sir what is your name therefore achilles but whate'er know this in the extremity of great and little valor and pride excel themselves in hector the one almost as infinite as all the other blank as nothing weigh him well and that which looks like pride is courtesy this ajax is half made of hector's blood in love whereof half hector stays at home half heart half hand half hector comes to seek this blended knight half trojan and half greek princes enough so please you there is expectance here from both the sides what further you will do the noble menelaus 'tis the old nestor i have been seeking you this hour my lord hector by this is arming him in troy ajax your guard stays to conduct you home stand ho yet are we masters of the field never go home here starve we out the night hector the gods forbid my lord you do discomfort all the host
