that have dishonored me rome and the righteous heavens be my judge how i have loved and honored saturnine i thank your majesty and her my lord these words these looks infuse new life in me tomorrow an it please your majesty to hunt the panther and the hart with me with horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour the hunt is up the moon is bright and gray the fields are fragrant and the woods are green uncouple here and let us make a bay and wake the emperor and his lovely bride and rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal that all the court may echo with the noise sons let it be your charge as it is ours to attend the emperor's person carefully i have been troubled in my sleep this night but dawning day new comfort hath inspired many good morrows to your majesty  madam to you as many and as good  i promisèd your grace a hunter's peal and i have horse will follow where the game makes way and runs like swallows o'er the plain high emperor upon my feeble knee i beg this boon with tears not lightly shed that this fell fault of my accursèd sons  accursèd if the faults be proved in them  i did my lord yet let me be their bail for by my father's reverend tomb i vow they shall be ready at your highness' will to answer their suspicion with their lives come lucius come stay not to talk with them hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay for pity of mine age whose youth was spent in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept for all my blood in rome's great quarrel shed for all the frosty nights that i have watched and for these bitter tears which now you see filling the agèd wrinkles in my cheeks be pitiful to my condemnèd sons whose souls is not corrupted as 'tis thought for two and twenty sons i never wept because they died in honor's lofty bed for these tribunes in the dust i write my heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite my sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush o earth i will befriend thee more with rain that shall distil from these two ancient ruins than youthful april shall with all his showers in summer's drought i'll drop upon thee still in winter with warm tears i'll melt the snow and keep eternal springtime on thy face so thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood o reverend tribunes o gentle agèd men unbind my sons reverse the doom of death and let me say that never wept before my tears are now prevailing orators ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead  grave tribunes once more i entreat of you  why 'tis no matter man if they did hear they would not mark me if they did mark they would not pity me yet plead i must and bootless unto them therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones who though they cannot answer my distress yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes for that they will not intercept my tale when i do weep they humbly at my feet receive my tears and seem to weep with me and were they but attirèd in grave weeds rome could afford no tribunes like to these a stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones a stone is silent and offendeth not and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death but wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn o happy man they have befriended thee why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive that rome is but a wilderness of tigers tigers must prey and rome affords no prey but me and mine how happy art thou then from these devourers to be banishèd but who comes with our brother marcus here will it consume me let me see it then why marcus so she is faint hearted boy arise and look upon her  speak lavinia what accursèd hand hath made thee handless in thy father's sight what fool hath added water to the sea or brought a faggot to bright burning troy my grief was at the height before thou cam'st and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds  give me a sword i'll chop off my hands too for they have fought for rome and all in vain and they have nursed this woe in feeding life in bootless prayer have they been held up and they have served me to effectless use now all the service i require of them is that the one will help to cut the other  'tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands for hands to do rome service is but vain it was my dear and he that wounded her hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead for now i stand as one upon a rock environed with a wilderness of sea who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave expecting ever when some envious surge will in his brinish bowels swallow him this way to death my wretched sons are gone here stands my other son a banished man and here my brother weeping at my woes but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn is dear lavinia dearer than my soul had i but seen thy picture in this plight it would have madded me what shall i do now i behold thy lively body so thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears nor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee thy husband he is dead and for his death thy brothers are condemned and dead by this  look marcus ah son lucius look on her when i did name her brothers then fresh tears stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew upon a gathered lily almost withered if they did kill thy husband then be joyful because the law hath ta'en revenge on them  no no they would not do so foul a deed witness the sorrow that their sister makes  gentle lavinia let me kiss thy lips or make some sign how i may do thee ease shall thy good uncle and thy brother lucius and thou and i sit round about some fountain looking all downwards to behold our cheeks how they are stained like meadows yet not dry with miry slime left on them by a flood and in the fountain shall we gaze so long till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness and made a brine pit with our bitter tears or shall we cut away our hands like thine or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows pass the remainder of our hateful days what shall we do let us that have our tongues plot some device of further misery to make us wondered at in time to come ah marcus marcus brother well i wot thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine for thou poor man hast drowned it with thine own mark marcus mark i understand her signs had she a tongue to speak now would she say that to her brother which i said to thee his napkin with his true tears all bewet can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks o what a sympathy of woe is this as far from help as limbo is from bliss o gracious emperor o gentle aaron did ever raven sing so like a lark that gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise with all my heart i'll send the emperor my hand good aaron wilt thou help to chop it off sirs strive no more such withered herbs as these are meet for plucking up and therefore mine agree between you i will spare my hand come hither aaron i'll deceive them both lend me thy hand and i will give thee mine now stay your strife what shall be is dispatched  good aaron give his majesty my hand tell him it was a hand that warded him from thousand dangers bid him bury it more hath it merited that let it have as for my sons say i account of them as jewels purchased at an easy price and yet dear too because i bought mine own o here i lift this one hand up to heaven and bow this feeble ruin to the earth if any power pities wretched tears to that i call what wouldst thou kneel with me do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim and stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds when they do hug him in their melting bosoms is not my sorrow deep having no bottom then be my passions bottomless with them if there were reason for these miseries then into limits could i bind my woes when heaven doth weep doth not the earth o'erflow if the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad threat'ning the welkin with his big swoll'n face and wilt thou have a reason for this coil i am the sea hark how her sighs doth flow she is the weeping welkin i the earth then must my sea be movèd with her sighs then must my earth with her continual tears become a deluge overflowed and drowned forwhy my bowels cannot hide her woes but like a drunkard must i vomit them then give me leave for losers will have leave to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues when will this fearful slumber have an end ha ha ha why i have not another tear to shed besides this sorrow is an enemy and would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes and make them blind with tributary tears then which way shall i find revenge's cave for these two heads do seem to speak to me and threat me i shall never come to bliss till all these mischiefs be returned again even in their throats that hath committed them come let me see what task i have to do you heavy people circle me about that i may turn me to each one of you and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs the vow is made come brother take a head and in this hand the other will i bear  and lavinia thou shalt be employed in these arms bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth  as for thee boy go get thee from my sight thou art an exile and thou must not stay hie to the goths and raise an army there and if you love me as i think you do let's kiss and part for we have much to do so so now sit and look you eat no more than will preserve just so much strength in us as will revenge these bitter woes of ours marcus unknit that sorrow wreathen knot thy niece and i poor creatures want our hands and cannot passionate our tenfold grief with folded arms this poor right hand of mine is left to tyrannize upon my breast who when my heart all mad with misery beats in this hollow prison of my flesh then thus i thump it down  thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating thou canst not strike it thus to make it still wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans or get some little knife between thy teeth and just against thy heart make thou a hole that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall may run into that sink and soaking in drown the lamenting fool in sea salt tears how now has sorrow made thee dote already why marcus no man should be mad but i what violent hands can she lay on her life ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands to bid aeneas tell the tale twice o'er how troy was burnt and he made miserable o handle not the theme to talk of hands lest we remember still that we have none  fie fie how franticly i square my talk as if we should forget we had no hands if marcus did not name the word of hands come let's fall to and gentle girl eat this here is no drink hark marcus what she says i can interpret all her martyred signs she says she drinks no other drink but tears brewed with her sorrow mashed upon her cheeks  speechless complainer i will learn thy thought in thy dumb action will i be as perfect as begging hermits in their holy prayers thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign but i of these will wrest an alphabet and by still practice learn to know thy meaning peace tender sapling thou art made of tears and tears will quickly melt thy life away what dost thou strike at marcus with thy knife out on thee murderer thou kill'st my heart mine eyes are cloyed with view of tyranny a deed of death done on the innocent becomes not titus' brother get thee gone i see thou art not for my company but how if that fly had a father and mother how would he hang his slender gilded wings and buzz lamenting doings in the air poor harmless fly that with his pretty buzzing melody came here to make us merry and thou hast killed him o o o then pardon me for reprehending thee for thou hast done a charitable deed give me thy knife i will insult on him flattering myself as if it were the moor come hither purposely to poison me there's for thyself and that's for tamora ah sirrah yet i think we are not brought so low but that between us we can kill a fly that comes in likeness of a coal black moor come take away lavinia go with me i'll to thy closet

shame with thee and with thy shame thy father's sorrow die killed her for whom my tears have made me blind i am as woeful as virginius was and have a thousand times more cause than he to do this outrage and it now is done will 't please you eat will 't please your highness feed not i 'twas chiron and demetrius they ravished her and cut away her tongue and they 'twas they that did her all this wrong why there they are both bakèd in this pie whereof their mother daintily hath fed eating the flesh that she herself hath bred 'tis true 'tis true witness my knife's sharp point
