shake quoth the dovehouse 'twas no need i trow to bid me trudge and since that time it is eleven years for then she could stand high lone nay by th' rood she could have run and waddled all about for even the day before she broke her brow and then my husband god be with his soul he was a merry man took up the child yea quoth he dost thou fall upon thy face thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit wilt thou not jule and by my holidam the pretty wretch left crying and said ay to see now how a jest shall come about i warrant an i should live a thousand years i never should forget it wilt
