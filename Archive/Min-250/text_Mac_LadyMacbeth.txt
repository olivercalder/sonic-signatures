they met me in the day of success and i have learned by the perfect'st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge when i burned in desire to question them further they made themselves air into which they vanished whiles i stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king who all hailed me thane of cawdor by which title before these weïrd sisters saluted me and referred me to the coming on of time with hail king that shalt be this have i thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou might'st not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee lay it to thy heart and farewell glamis thou art and cawdor and shalt be what thou art promised yet do i fear thy nature it is too full o' th' milk of human kindness to catch the nearest way thou wouldst be great art not without ambition but without the illness should attend it what thou wouldst highly that wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false and yet wouldst wrongly win thou 'dst have great glamis that which cries thus thou must do if thou have it and that which rather thou dost fear to do than wishest should be undone hie thee hither that i may pour my spirits in thine ear and chastise with the valor of my tongue all that impedes thee from the golden round which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem to have thee crowned withal what is your tidings thou 'rt mad to say it is not thy master with him who were 't so would have informed for preparation give him tending he brings great news the raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of duncan under my battlements come you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here and fill me from the crown to the toe top full of direst cruelty make thick my blood stop up th' access and passage to remorse that no compunctious visitings of nature shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between th' effect and it come to my woman's breasts and take my milk for gall you murd'ring ministers wherever in your sightless substances you wait on nature's mischief come thick night and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell that my keen knife see not the wound it makes nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark to cry hold hold great glamis worthy cawdor greater than both by the all hail hereafter thy letters have transported me beyond this ignorant present and i feel now the future in the instant and when goes hence o never shall sun that morrow see your face my thane is as a book where men may read strange matters to beguile the time look like the time bear welcome in your eye your hand your tongue look like th' innocent flower but be the serpent under 't he that's coming must be provided for and you shall put this night's great business into my dispatch which shall to all our nights and days to come give solely sovereign sway and masterdom only look up clear to alter favor ever is to fear leave all the rest to me all our service in every point twice done and then done double were poor and single business to contend against those honors deep and broad wherewith your majesty loads our house for those of old and the late dignities heaped up to them we rest your hermits your servants ever have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt to make their audit at your highness' pleasure still to return your own he has almost supped why have you left the chamber know you not he has was the hope drunk wherein you dressed yourself hath it slept since and wakes it now to look so green and pale at what it did so freely from this time such i account thy love art thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valor as thou art in desire wouldst thou have that which thou esteem'st the ornament of life and live a coward in thine own esteem letting i dare not wait upon i would like the poor cat i' th' adage what beast was 't then that made you break this enterprise to me when you durst do it then you were a man and to be more than what you were you would be so much more the man nor time nor place did then adhere and yet you would make both they have made themselves and that their fitness now does unmake you i have given suck and know how tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me i would while it was smiling in my face have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums and dashed the brains out had i so sworn as you have done to this we fail but screw your courage to the sticking place and we'll not fail when duncan is asleep whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey soundly invite him his two chamberlains will i with wine and wassail so convince that memory the warder of the brain shall be a fume and the receipt of reason a limbeck only when in swinish sleep their drenchèd natures lies as in a death what cannot you and i perform upon th' unguarded duncan what not put upon his spongy officers who shall bear the guilt of our great quell who dares receive it other as we shall make our griefs and clamor roar upon his death that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold what hath quenched them hath given me fire hark peace it was the owl that shrieked the fatal bellman which gives the stern'st good night he is about it the doors are open and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores i have drugged their possets that death and nature do contend about them whether they live or die alack i am afraid they have awaked and 'tis not done th' attempt and not the deed confounds us hark i laid their daggers ready he could not miss 'em had he not resembled my father as he slept i had done 't my husband i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry did not you speak now ay donalbain a foolish thought to say a sorry sight there are two lodged together consider it not so deeply these deeds must not be thought after these ways so it will make us mad what do you mean who was it that thus cried why worthy thane you do unbend your noble strength to think so brainsickly of things go get some water and wash this filthy witness from your hand  why did you bring these daggers from the place they must lie there go carry them and smear the sleepy grooms with blood infirm of purpose give me the daggers the sleeping and the dead are but as pictures 'tis the eye of childhood that fears a painted devil if he do bleed i'll gild the faces of the grooms withal for it must seem their guilt my hands are of your color but i shame to wear a heart so white i hear a knocking at the south entry retire we to our chamber a little water clears us of this deed how easy is it then your constancy hath left you unattended hark more knocking get on your nightgown lest occasion call us and show us to be watchers be not lost so poorly in your thoughts what's the business that such a hideous trumpet calls to parley the sleepers of the house speak speak woe alas what in our house help me hence ho if he had been forgotten it had been as a gap in our great feast and all thing unbecoming is banquo gone from court say to the king i would attend his leisure for a few words naught's had all's spent where our desire is got without content 'tis safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy how now my lord why do you keep alone of sorriest fancies your companions making using those thoughts which should indeed have died with them they think on things without all remedy should be without regard what's done is done come on gentle my lord sleek o'er your rugged looks be bright and jovial among your guests tonight you must leave this but in them nature's copy's not eterne what's to be done pronounce it for me sir to all our friends for my heart speaks they are welcome my royal lord you do not give the cheer the feast is sold that is not often vouched while 'tis a making 'tis given with welcome to feed were best at home from thence the sauce to meat is ceremony meeting were bare without it sit worthy friends my lord is often thus and hath been from his youth pray you keep seat the fit is momentary upon a thought he will again be well if much you note him you shall offend him and extend his passion feed and regard him not are you a man o proper stuff this is the very painting of your fear this is the air drawn dagger which you said led you to duncan o these flaws and starts impostors to true fear would well become a woman's story at a winter's fire authorized by her grandam shame itself why do you make such faces when all's done you look but on a stool what quite unmanned in folly fie for shame my worthy lord your noble friends do lack you think of this good peers but as a thing of custom 'tis no other only it spoils the pleasure of the time you have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting with most admired disorder i pray you speak not he grows worse and worse question enrages him at once good night stand not upon the order of your going but go at once a kind good night to all almost at odds with morning which is which did you send to him sir you lack the season of all natures sleep yet here's a spot out damned spot out i say one two why then 'tis time to do 't hell is murky fie my lord fie a soldier and afeard what need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to account yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him the thane of fife had a wife where is she now what will these hands ne'er be clean no more o' that my lord no more o' that you mar all with this starting here's the smell of the blood still all the perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little hand o o o wash your hands
