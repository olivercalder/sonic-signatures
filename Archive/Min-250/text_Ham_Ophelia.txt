do you doubt that no more but so i shall the effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whiles like a puffed and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede 'tis in my memory locked and you yourself shall keep the key of it so please you something touching the lord hamlet he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me i do not know my lord what i should think my lord he hath importuned me with love in honorable fashion  and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven i shall obey my lord o my lord my lord i have been so affrighted my lord as i was sewing in my closet lord hamlet with his doublet all unbraced no hat upon his head his stockings fouled ungartered and down gyvèd to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosèd out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o'er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stayed he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turned he seemed to find his way without his eyes for out o' doors he went without their helps and to the last bended their light on me no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me madam i wish it may good my lord how does your honor for this many a day my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longèd long to redeliver i pray you now receive them my honored lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath composed as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there my lord my lord what means your lordship could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty indeed my lord you made me believe so i was the more deceived at home my lord o help him you sweet heavens heavenly powers restore him o what a noble mind is here o'erthrown the courtier's soldier's scholar's eye tongue sword th' expectancy and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mold of form th' observed of all observers quite quite down and i of ladies most deject and wretched that sucked the honey of his musicked vows now see that noble and most sovereign reason like sweet bells jangled out of time and harsh that unmatched form and stature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me t' have seen what i have seen see what i see no my lord ay my lord i think nothing my lord what is my lord you are merry my lord ay my lord nay 'tis twice two months my lord what means this my lord belike this show imports the argument of the play will he tell us what this show

beauteous majesty of denmark how should i your true love know from another one by his cockle hat and staff and his sandal shoon say you nay pray you mark he is dead and gone lady he is dead and gone at his head a grass green turf at his heels a stone oh ho pray you mark white his shroud as the mountain snow  larded all with sweet flowers which bewept to the ground did not go with true love
