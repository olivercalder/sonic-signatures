when thou clovest thy crown i' th' middle and gav'st away both parts thou bor'st thine ass on thy back o'er the dirt thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gav'st thy golden one away if i speak like myself in this let him be whipped that first finds it so fools had ne'er less grace in a year for wise men are grown foppish and know not how their wits to wear their manners are so apish i have used it nuncle e'er since thou mad'st thy daughters thy mothers for when thou gav'st them the rod and put'st down thine own breeches then they for sudden joy did weep and i for sorrow sung that such a king should play bo peep and go the fools among prithee nuncle keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie i would fain learn to lie i marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are they'll have me whipped for speaking true thou 'lt have me whipped for lying and sometimes i am whipped for holding my peace i had rather be any kind o' thing than a fool and yet i would not be thee nuncle

all shall want some that's a shelled peascod for you know nuncle the hedge sparrow fed the cuckoo so long that it's had it head bit off by it young so out went the candle and we were left darkling may not an ass know when the cart draws the horse whoop jug i love thee lear's shadow which they will make an obedient father nuncle lear nuncle lear tarry take the fool with thee a fox when one has caught her and such a daughter should sure to the slaughter if my cap would buy a halter so the fool follows after if a man's brains were in 's heels were 't not in danger of kibes then i prithee be merry thy wit shall not go slipshod shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly for though she's as like this as a crab's like an apple yet i can tell what i can tell she will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab thou canst tell why one's nose stands i' th' middle on 's face why to keep one's eyes of either side 's nose that what a man cannot smell out he may spy into canst tell how an oyster makes his shell nor i neither but i can tell why a snail has a house why to put 's head in not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case thy asses are gone about 'em the reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason yes indeed thou wouldst make a good fool if thou wert my fool nuncle i'd have thee beaten for being old before thy time thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise she that's a maid now and laughs at my departure shall not be a maid long unless things be cut shorter ha ha he wears cruel garters horses are tied by the heads dogs and bears by th' neck monkeys by th' loins and men by th' legs when a man's overlusty at legs then he wears wooden netherstocks winter's not gone yet if the wild geese fly that way fathers that wear rags do make their children blind but fathers that bear bags shall see their children kind fortune that arrant whore ne'er turns the key to th' poor but for all this thou shalt have as many dolors for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year an thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question thou 'dst well deserved it we'll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there's no laboring i' th' winter all that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men and there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him that's stinking let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with following but the great one that goes upward let him draw thee after when a wise man gives thee better counsel give me mine again i would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it that sir which serves and seeks for gain and follows but for form will pack when it begins to rain and leave thee in the storm but i will tarry the fool will stay and let the wise man fly the knave turns fool that runs away the fool no knave perdie not i' th' stocks fool cry to it nuncle as the cockney did to the eels when she put 'em i' th' paste alive she knapped 'em o' th' coxcombs with a stick and cried down wantons down 'twas her brother that in pure kindness to his horse buttered his hay o nuncle court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o' door good nuncle in ask thy daughters' blessing here's a night pities neither wise men nor fools he that has a house to put 's head in has a good headpiece the codpiece that will house before the head has any the head and he shall louse so beggars marry many the man that makes his toe what he his heart should make shall of a corn cry woe and turn his sleep to wake for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass marry here's grace and a codpiece that's a wise man and a fool he that has and a little tiny wit with hey ho the wind and the rain must make content with his fortunes fit though the rain it raineth every day this is a brave night to cool a courtesan i'll speak a prophecy ere i go when priests are more in word than matter when brewers mar their malt with water when nobles are their tailors' tutors no heretics burned but wenches' suitors when every case in law is right no squire in debt nor no poor knight when slanders do not live in tongues nor cutpurses come not to throngs when usurers tell their gold i' th' field and bawds and whores do churches build then shall the realm of albion come to great confusion then comes the time who lives to see 't that going shall be used with feet this prophecy merlin shall make for i live before his time come not in here nuncle here's a spirit help me help me a spirit a spirit he says his name's poor tom nay he reserved a blanket else we had been all shamed this cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen prithee nuncle be contented 'tis a naughty night to swim in now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's heart a small spark all the rest on 's body cold look here comes a walking fire prithee nuncle tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a yeoman no he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him he's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf a horse's health a boy's love or a whore's oath her boat hath a leak and she must not speak why she dares not come over to thee come hither mistress is your name goneril cry you mercy i took you for a joint stool and i'll go to bed at noon
