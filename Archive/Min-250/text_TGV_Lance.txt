nay'twill be this hour ere i have done weeping all the kind of the lances have this very fault i have received my proportion like the prodigious son and am going with sir proteus to the imperial's court i think crab my dog be the sourest natured dog that lives my mother weeping my father wailing my sister crying our maid howling our cat wringing her hands and all our house in a great perplexity yet did not this cruel hearted cur shed one tear he is a stone a very pibble stone and has no more pity in him than a dog a jew would have wept to have seen our parting why my grandam having no eyes look you wept herself blind at my parting nay i'll show you the manner of it this shoe is my father no this left shoe is my father no no this left shoe is my mother nay that cannot be so neither yes it is so it is so it hath the worser sole this shoe with the hole in it is my mother and this my father a vengeance on 't there 'tis now sir this staff is my sister for look you she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand this hat is nan our maid i am the dog no the dog is himself and i am the dog o the dog is me and i am myself ay so so now come i to my father father your blessing now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping now should i kiss my father well he weeps on now come i to my mother o that she could speak now like a wold woman well i kiss her why there 'tis here's my mother's breath up and down now come i to my sister mark the moan she makes now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word but see how i lay the dust with my tears it is no matter if the tied were lost for it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied why he that's tied here crab my dog for fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue in thy tale lose the tide and the voyage and the master and the service and the tied why man if the river were dry i am able to fill it with my tears if the wind were down i could drive the boat with my sighs sir call me what thou dar'st well i will go forswear not thyself sweet youth for i am not welcome i reckon this always that a man is never undone till he be hanged nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say welcome marry after they closed in earnest they parted very fairly in jest no no neither no they are both as whole as a fish marry thus when it stands well with him it stands well with her what a block art thou that thou canst not my staff understands me ay and what i do too look thee i'll but lean and my staff understands me why stand under and understand is all one ask my dog if he say ay it will if he say no it will if he shake his tail and say nothing it will thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable i never knew him otherwise a notable lubber as thou reportest him to be why fool i meant not thee i meant thy master why i tell thee i care not though he burn himself in love if thou wilt go with me to the alehouse if not thou art an hebrew a jew and not worth the name of a christian because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a christian wilt thou go so ho so ho him we go to find there's not a hair on 's head but 'tis a valentine can nothing speak master shall i strike nothing why sir i'll strike nothing i pray you  sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished i am but a fool look you and yet i have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave but that's all one if he be but one knave he lives not now that knows me to be in love yet i am in love but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me nor who 'tis i love and yet 'tis a woman but what woman i will not tell myself and yet 'tis a milk maid yet 'tis not a maid for she hath had gossips yet 'tis a maid for she is her master's maid and serves for wages she hath more qualities than a water spaniel which is much in a bare christian here is the catalog of her condition imprimis she can fetch and carry why a horse can do no more nay a horse cannot fetch but only carry therefore is she better than a jade item she can milk look you a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands with my master's ship why it is at sea the black'st news that ever thou heard'st why as black as ink fie on thee jolt head thou canst not read i will try thee tell me this who begot thee o illiterate loiterer it was the son of thy grandmother this proves that thou canst not read there and saint nicholas be thy speed ay that she can and thereof comes the proverb blessing of your heart you brew good ale that's as much as to say can she so what need a man care for a stock with a wench when she can knit him a stock a special virtue for then she need not be washed and scoured then may i set the world on wheels when she can spin for her living that's as much as to say bastard virtues that indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no names close at the heels of her virtues well that fault may be mended with a breakfast read on that makes amends for her sour breath it's no matter for that so she sleep not in her talk o villain that set this down among her vices to be slow in words is a woman's only virtue i pray thee out with 't and place it for her chief virtue out with that too it was eve's legacy and cannot be ta'en from her i care not for that neither because i love crusts well the best is she hath no teeth to bite if her liquor be good she shall if she will not i will for good things should be praised of her tongue she cannot for that's writ down she is slow of of her purse she shall not for that i'll keep shut now of another thing she may and that cannot i help well proceed stop there i'll have her she was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article rehearse that once more more hair than wit it may be i'll prove it the cover of the salt hides the salt and therefore it is more than the salt the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit for the greater hides the less what's next that's monstrous o that that were out why that word makes the faults gracious well i'll have her and if it be a match as nothing is impossible  why then will i tell thee that thy master stays for thee at the north gate for thee ay who art thou he hath stayed for a better man than thee thou must run to him for thou hast stayed so long that going will scarce serve the turn now will he be swinged for reading my letter an unmannerly slave that will thrust himself into secrets i'll after to rejoice in the boy's correction when a man's servant shall play the cur with him look you it goes hard one that i brought up of a puppy one that i saved from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it i have taught him even as one would say precisely thus i would teach a dog i was sent to deliver him as a present to mistress sylvia from my master and i came no sooner into the dining chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg o 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies i would have as one should say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things if i had not had more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did i think verily he had been hanged for 't sure as i live he had suffered for 't you shall judge he thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table he had not been there bless the mark a pissing while but all the chamber smelt him out with the dog says one what cur is that says another whip him out says the third hang him up says the duke i having been acquainted with the smell before knew it was crab and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs friend quoth i you mean to whip the dog ay marry do i quoth he you do him the more wrong quoth i 'twas i did the thing you wot of he makes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber how many masters would do this for his servant nay i'll be sworn i have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen otherwise he had been executed i have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed otherwise he had suffered for 't thou think'st not of this now nay i remember the trick you served me when i took my

marry sir i carried mistress sylvia the dog you bade me marry she says your dog was a cur and tells you currish thanks is good enough for such a present no indeed did she not here have i brought him
