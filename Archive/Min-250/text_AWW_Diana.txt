they say the french count has done most honorable service you shall not need to fear me the count rossillion know you such a one whatsome'er he is he's bravely taken here he stole from france as 'tis reported for the king had married him against his liking think you it is so there is a gentleman that serves the count reports but coarsely of her monsieur parolles alas poor lady 'tis a hard bondage to become the wife of a detesting lord he that with the plume 'tis a most gallant fellow i would he loved his wife if he were honester he were much goodlier is 't not a handsome gentleman 'tis pity he is not honest yond's that same knave that leads him to these places were i his lady i would poison that vile rascal that jackanapes with scarves why is he melancholy we'll take your offer kindly no my good lord diana she then was honest no my mother did but duty such my lord as you owe to your wife ay so you serve us till we serve you but when you have our roses you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves and mock us with our bareness 'tis not the many oaths that makes the truth but the plain single vow that is vowed true what is not holy that we swear not by but take the high'st to witness then pray you tell me if i should swear by jove's great attributes i loved you dearly would you believe my oaths when i did love you ill this has no holding to swear by him whom i protest to love that i will work against him therefore your oaths are words and poor conditions but unsealed at least in my opinion i see that men may rope 's in such a snare that we'll forsake ourselves give me that ring will you not my lord mine honor's such a ring my chastity's the jewel of our house bequeathèd down from many ancestors which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world in me to lose thus your own proper wisdom brings in the champion honor on my part against your vain assault when midnight comes knock at my chamber window i'll order take my mother shall not hear now will i charge you in the band of truth when you have conquered my yet maiden bed remain there but an hour nor speak to me my reasons are most strong and you shall know them when back again this ring shall be delivered and on your finger in the night i'll put another ring that what in time proceeds may token to the future our past deeds adieu till then then fail not you have won a wife of me though there my hope be done for which live long to thank both heaven and me you may so in the end my mother told me just how he would woo as if she sat in 's heart she says all men have the like oaths he had sworn to marry me when his wife's dead therefore i'll lie with him when i am buried since frenchmen are so braid marry that will i live and die a maid only in this disguise i think 't no sin to cozen him that would unjustly win let death and honesty go with your impositions i am yours upon your will to suffer i am my lord a wretched florentine derivèd from the ancient capilet my suit as i do understand you know and therefore know how far i may be pitied why do you look so strange upon your wife if you shall marry you give away this hand and that is mine you give away heaven's vows and those are mine you give away myself which is known mine for i by vow am so embodied yours that she which marries you must marry me either both or none good my lord ask him upon his oath if he does think he had not my virginity he does me wrong my lord if i were so he might have bought me at a common price do not believe him o behold this ring whose high respect and rich validity did lack a parallel yet for all that he gave it to a commoner o' th' camp if i be one i did my lord but loath am to produce so bad an instrument his name's parolles i must be patient you that have turned off a first so noble wife may justly diet me i pray you yet  since you lack virtue i will lose a husband  send for your ring i will return it home and give me mine again sir much like the same upon your finger and this was it i gave him being abed i have spoke the truth ay my lord do you know he promised me marriage ay my good lord it was not given me nor i did not buy it it was not lent me neither i found it not i never gave it him it might be yours or hers for aught i know i'll never tell you i'll put in bail my liege by jove if ever i knew man 'twas you because he's guilty and he is not guilty he knows i am no maid and he'll swear to 't i'll swear i am a maid and he knows not great king i am no strumpet by my life i am either maid or else this old man's wife good mother fetch my bail stay royal sir the jeweler that owes the ring is sent for and he shall surety me but for this lord who hath abused me as he knows himself though yet he never harmed me here i quit him he knows himself my bed he hath defiled and at that time he got his wife with child dead though she be she feels her young one kick so there's my riddle one that's dead is quick and now behold the meaning
