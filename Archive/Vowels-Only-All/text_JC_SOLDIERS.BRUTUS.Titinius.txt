good night lord brutus o cassius brutus gave the word too early who having some advantage on octavius took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil whilst we by antony are all enclosed they are my lord i will be here again even with a thought these tidings will well comfort cassius all disconsolate with pindarus his bondman on this hill he lies not like the living o my heart no this was he messala but cassius is no more o setting sun as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night so in his red blood cassius' day is set the sun of rome is set our day is gone clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done mistrust of my success hath done this deed what pindarus where art thou pindarus hie you messala and i will seek for pindarus the while why didst thou send me forth brave cassius did i not meet thy friends and did not they put on my brows this wreath of victory and bid me give it thee didst thou not hear their shouts alas thou hast misconstrued everything but hold thee take this garland on thy brow thy brutus bid me give it thee and i will do his bidding brutus come apace and see how i regarded caius cassius  by your leave gods this is a roman's part come cassius' sword and find titinius' heart
