my dread lord your leave and favor to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon my necessaries are embarked farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convey is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you for hamlet and the trifling of his favor hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weighed his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalued persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the safety and the health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscribed unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honor may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmastered importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclosed and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave most humbly do i take my leave my lord farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you farewell where is this king sirs stand you all without i pray you give me leave i thank you keep the door o thou vile king give me my father that drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot even here between the chaste unsmirchèd brow of my true mother where is my father how came he dead i'll not be juggled with to hell allegiance vows to the blackest devil conscience and grace to the profoundest pit i dare damnation to this point i stand that both the worlds i give to negligence let come what comes only i'll be revenged most throughly for my father my will not all the world and for my means i'll husband them so well they shall go far with little none but his enemies to his good friends thus wide i'll ope my arms and like the kind life rend'ring pelican repast them with my blood how now what noise is that o heat dry up my brains tears seven times salt burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye by heaven thy madness shall be paid with weight till our scale turn the beam o rose of may dear maid kind sister sweet ophelia o heavens is 't possible a young maid's wits should be as mortal as an old man's life nature is fine in love and where 'tis fine it sends some precious instance of itself after the thing it loves hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge it could not move thus this nothing's more than matter a document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted thought and afflictions passion hell itself she turns to favor and to prettiness do you see this o god let this be so his means of death his obscure funeral no trophy sword nor hatchment o'er his bones no noble rite nor formal ostentation cry to be heard as 'twere from heaven to earth that i must call 't in question it well appears but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats so criminal and so capital in nature as by your safety greatness wisdom all things else you mainly were stirred up and so have i a noble father lost a sister driven into desp'rate terms whose worth if praises may go back again stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections but my revenge will come know you the hand i am lost in it my lord but let him come it warms the very sickness in my heart that i shall live and tell him to his teeth thus didst thou ay my lord so you will not o'errule me to a peace my lord i will be ruled the rather if you could devise it so that i might be the organ what part is that my lord a norman was 't upon my life lamord i know him well he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation what out of this my lord why ask you this to cut his throat i' th' church i will do 't and for that purpose i'll anoint my sword i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that but dip a knife in it where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death that is but scratched withal i'll touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death drowned o where alas then she is drowned too much of water hast thou poor ophelia and therefore i forbid my tears but yet it is our trick nature her custom holds let shame say what it will when these are gone the woman will be out adieu my lord i have a speech o' fire that fain would blaze but that this folly drowns it what ceremony else what ceremony else must there no more be done lay her i' th' earth and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring i tell thee churlish priest a minist'ring angel shall my sister be when thou liest howling o treble woe fall ten times treble on that cursèd head whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of hold off the earth awhile till i have caught her once more in mine arms now pile your dust upon the quick and dead till of this flat a mountain you have made t' o'ertop old pelion or the skyish head of blue olympus the devil take thy soul i am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge but in my terms of honor i stand aloof and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honor i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored but till that time i do receive your offered love like love and will not wrong it come one for me you mock me sir this is too heavy let me see another come my lord no well again a touch a touch i do confess 't my lord i'll hit him now and yet it is almost against my conscience say you so come on have at you now why as a woodcock to mine own springe osric i am justly killed with mine own treachery it is here hamlet hamlet thou art slain no med'cine in the world can do thee good in thee there is not half an hour's life the treacherous instrument is in thy hand unbated and envenomed the foul practice hath turned itself on me lo here i lie never to rise again thy mother's poisoned i can no more the king the king's to blame he is justly served it is a poison tempered by himself exchange forgiveness with me noble hamlet mine and my father's death come not upon thee nor thine on me
