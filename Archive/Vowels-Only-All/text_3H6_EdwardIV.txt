lord stafford's father duke of buckingham is either slain or wounded dangerous i cleft his beaver with a downright blow that this is true father behold his blood sweet father do so set it on your head no i can better play the orator no quarrel but a slight contention now you are heir therefore enjoy it now by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe it will outrun you father in the end but for a kingdom any oath may be broken i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year i hear their drums let's set our men in order and issue forth and bid them battle straight i wonder how our princely father scaped or whether he be scaped away or no from clifford's and northumberland's pursuit had he been ta'en we should have heard the news had he been slain we should have heard the news or had he scaped methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape how fares my brother why is he so sad dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns 'tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of i think it cites us brother to the field that we the sons of brave plantagenet each one already blazing by our meeds should notwithstanding join our lights together and overshine the earth as this the world whate'er it bodes henceforward will i bear upon my target three fair shining suns o speak no more for i have heard too much sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay o clifford boist'rous clifford thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquished him for hand to hand he would have vanquished thee now my soul's palace is become a prison ah would she break from hence that this my body might in the ground be clos√®d up in rest for never henceforth shall i joy again never o never shall i see more joy his name that valiant duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left o warwick warwick that plantagenet which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption is by the stern lord clifford done to death where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou fail'st as god forbid the hour  must edward fall which peril heaven forfend then strike up drums god and saint george for us now perjured henry wilt thou kneel for grace and set thy diadem upon my head or bide the mortal fortune of the field i am his king and he should bow his knee i was adopted heir by his consent since when his oath is broke for as i hear you that are king though he do wear the crown have caused him by new act of parliament to blot out me and put his own son in say henry shall i have my right or no a thousand men have broke their fasts today that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns to make this shameless callet know herself  helen of greece was fairer far than thou although thy husband may be menelaus and ne'er was agamemnon's brother wronged by that false woman as this king by thee his father reveled in the heart of france and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop and had he matched according to his state he might have kept that glory to this day but when he took a beggar to his bed and graced thy poor sire with his bridal day even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him that washed his father's fortunes forth of france and heaped sedition on his crown at home for what hath broached this tumult but thy pride hadst thou been meek our title still had slept and we in pity of the gentle king had slipped our claim until another age and in this resolution i defy thee not willing any longer conference since thou denied'st the gentle king to speak  sound trumpets let our bloody colors wave and either victory or else a grave no wrangling woman we'll no longer stay these words will cost ten thousand lives this day smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death for this world frowns and edward's sun is clouded bootless is flight they follow us with wings and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit o warwick i do bend my knee with thine and in this vow do chain my soul to thine and ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee thou setter up and plucker down of kings beseeching thee if with thy will it stands that to my foes this body must be prey yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope and give sweet passage to my sinful soul now lords take leave until we meet again where'er it be in heaven or in earth now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks some troops pursue the bloody minded queen that led calm henry though he were a king as doth a sail filled with a fretting gust command an argosy to stem the waves but think you lords that clifford fled with them see who it is and now the battle's ended if friend or foe let him be gently used bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threat'ning sound and his ill boding tongue no more shall speak clifford repent in bootless penitence thou pitied'st rutland i will pity thee even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be for in thy shoulder do i build my seat and never will i undertake the thing wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting  richard i will create thee duke of gloucester and george of clarence warwick as ourself shall do and undo as him pleaseth best brother of gloucester at saint albans field this lady's husband sir richard grey was slain his land then seized on by the conqueror her suit is now to repossess those lands which we in justice cannot well deny because in quarrel of the house of york the worthy gentleman did lose his life it were no less but yet i'll make a pause widow we will consider of your suit and come some other time to know our mind how many children hast thou widow tell me 'twere pity they should lose their father's lands lords give us leave i'll try this widow's wit now tell me madam do you love your children and would you not do much to do them good then get your husband's lands to do them good i'll tell you how these lands are to be got what service wilt thou do me if i give them but you will take exceptions to my boon ay but thou canst do what i mean to ask an easy task 'tis but to love a king why then thy husband's lands i freely give thee but stay thee 'tis the fruits of love i mean ay but i fear me in another sense what love think'st thou i sue so much to get no by my troth i did not mean such love but now you partly may perceive my mind to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily ay if thou wilt say ay to my request no if thou dost say no to my demand her looks doth argue her replete with modesty her words doth show her wit incomparable all her perfections challenge sovereignty one way or other she is for a king and she shall be my love or else my queen  say that king edward take thee for his queen sweet widow by my state i swear to thee i speak no more than what my soul intends and that is to enjoy thee for my love you cavil widow i did mean my queen no more than when my daughters call thee mother thou art a widow and thou hast some children and by god's mother i being but a bachelor have other some why 'tis a happy thing to be the father unto many sons answer no more for thou shalt be my queen brothers you muse what chat we two have had you'd think it strange if i should marry her why clarence to myself well jest on brothers i can tell you both her suit is granted for her husband's lands see that he be conveyed unto the tower and go we brothers to the man that took him to question of his apprehension  widow go you along lords use her honorably now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent suppose they take offense without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwick's and must have my will yea brother richard are you offended too setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england's queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think what if both lewis and warwick be appeased by such invention as i can devise ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brother's will my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath now messenger what letters or what news from france go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henry's queen for i have heard that she was there in place belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarned they shall have wars and pay for their presumption but say is warwick friends with margaret clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i armed against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desp'rate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect now brother richard will you stand by us why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign power the duke why warwick when we parted thou call'dst me king yea brother of clarence art thou here too nay then i see that edward needs must down yet warwick in despite of all mischance of thee thyself and all thy complices edward will always bear himself as king though fortune's malice overthrow my state my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel what fates impose that men must needs abide it boots not to resist both wind and tide nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand  now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest stand you thus close to steal the bishop's deer but whither shall we then stanley i will requite thy forwardness huntsman what sayst thou wilt thou go along bishop farewell shield thee from warwick's frown and pray that i may repossess the crown now brother richard lord hastings and the rest yet thus far fortune maketh us amends and says that once more i shall interchange my wan√®d state for henry's regal crown well have we passed and now re passed the seas and brought desir√®d help from burgundy what then remains we being thus arrived from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york but that we enter as into our dukedom tush man abodements must not now affright us by fair or foul means we must enter in for hither will our friends repair to us but master mayor if henry be your king yet edward at the least is duke of york why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom as being well content with that alone so master mayor these gates must not be shut but in the night or in the time of war what fear not man but yield me up the keys for edward will defend the town and thee and all those friends that deign to follow me welcome sir john but why come you in arms thanks good montgomery but we now forget our title to the crown and only claim our dukedom till god please to send the rest nay stay sir john a while and we'll debate by what safe means the crown may be recovered when we grow stronger then we'll make our claim till then 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning then be it as you will for 'tis my right and henry but usurps the diadem thanks brave montgomery and thanks unto you all if fortune serve me i'll requite this kindness now for this night let's harbor here in york and when the morning sun shall raise his car above the border of this horizon we'll forward towards warwick and his mates for well i wot that henry is no soldier ah froward clarence how evil it beseems thee to flatter henry and forsake thy brother yet as we may we'll meet both thee and warwick come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day and that once gotten doubt not of large pay seize on the shamefaced henry bear him hence and once again proclaim us king of england  you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow now stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dry and swell so much the higher by their ebb  hence with him to the tower let him not speak and lords towards coventry bend we our course where peremptory warwick now remains the sun shines hot and if we use delay cold biting winter mars our hoped for hay go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle now warwick wilt thou ope the city gates speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee call edward king and at his hands beg mercy and he shall pardon thee these outrages why then 'tis mine if but by warwick's gift but warwick's king is edward's prisoner and gallant warwick do but answer this what is the body when the head is off 'tis even so yet you are warwick still sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend this hand fast wound about thy coal black hair shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off write in the dust this sentence with thy blood wind changing warwick now can change no more so other foes may set upon our backs stand we in good array for they no doubt will issue out again and bid us battle if not the city being but of small defense we'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same the harder matched the greater victory my mind presageth happy gain and conquest now welcome more and ten times more beloved than if thou never hadst deserved our hate what warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight or shall we beat the stones about thine ears yes warwick edward dares and leads the way  lords to the field saint george and victory so lie thou there die thou and die our fear for warwick was a bug that feared us all now montague sit fast i seek for thee that warwick's bones may keep thine company thus far our fortune keeps an upward course and we are graced with wreaths of victory but in the midst of this bright shining day i spy a black suspicious threat'ning cloud that will encounter with our glorious sun ere he attain his easeful western bed i mean my lords those powers that the queen hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast and as we hear march on to fight with us we are advertised by our loving friends that they do hold their course toward tewkesbury we having now the best at barnet field will thither straight for willingness rids way and as we march our strength will be augmented in every county as we go along strike up the drum cry courage and away brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood which by the heavens' assistance and your strength must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night i need not add more fuel to your fire for well i wot you blaze to burn them out give signal to the fight and to it lords now here a period of tumultuous broils away with oxford to hames castle straight for somerset off with his guilty head go bear them hence i will not hear them speak is proclamation made that who finds edward shall have a high reward and he his life bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak what can so young a thorn begin to prick  edward what satisfaction canst thou make for bearing arms for stirring up my subjects and all the trouble thou hast turned me to peace willful boy or i will charm your tongue take that the likeness of this railer here hold richard hold for we have done too much what doth she swoon use means for her recovery away with her go bear her hence perforce away i say i charge you bear her hence where's richard gone he's sudden if a thing comes in his head now march we hence discharge the common sort with pay and thanks and let's away to london and see our gentle queen how well she fares by this i hope she hath a son for me once more we sit in england's royal throne repurchased with the blood of enemies what valiant foemen like to autumn's corn have we mowed down in tops of all their pride three dukes of somerset threefold renowned for hardy and undoubted champions two cliffords as the father and the son and two northumberlands two braver men ne'er spurred their coursers at the trumpet's sound with them the two brave bears warwick and montague that in their chains fettered the kingly lion and made the forest tremble when they roared thus have we swept suspicion from our seat and made our footstool of security  come hither bess and let me kiss my boy  young ned for thee thine uncles and myself have in our armors watched the winter's night went all afoot in summer's scalding heat that thou mightst repossess the crown in peace and of our labors thou shalt reap the gain clarence and gloucester love my lovely queen and kiss your princely nephew brothers both thanks noble clarence worthy brother thanks now am i seated as my soul delights having my country's peace and brothers' loves away with her and waft her hence to france and now what rests but that we spend the time with stately triumphs mirthful comic shows such as befits the pleasure of the court sound drums and trumpets farewell sour annoy for here i hope begins our lasting joy
