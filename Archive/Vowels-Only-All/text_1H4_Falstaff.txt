if then thou be son to me here lies the point why being son to me art thou so pointed at shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries a question not to be asked shall the son of england prove a thief and take purses a question to be asked there is a thing harry which thou hast often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch as ancient writers do report doth defile so doth the company thou keepest for harry now i do not speak to thee in drink but in tears not in pleasure but in passion not in words only but in woes also and yet

think his age some fifty or by 'r lady inclining to threescore and now i remember me his name is falstaff if that man should be lewdly given he deceiveth me for harry i see virtue in his looks if then

ball of wildfire there's no purchase in money o thou art a perpetual triumph an everlasting bonfire light thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches walking with thee in the night

lieutenant peto meet me at town's end if i be not ashamed of my soldiers i am a soused gurnet i have misused the king's press damnably i have got in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers three hundred and odd pounds i press me none but good householders yeomen's sons inquire me out contracted bachelors such as had been asked twice on the banns such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lief hear the devil as a drum such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck i pressed me none but such toasts and butter with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins' heads and they have bought out their services and now my whole charge consists of ancients corporals lieutenants gentlemen of companies slaves as ragged as lazarus in the painted cloth where the glutton's dogs licked his sores and such as indeed were never soldiers but discarded unjust servingmen younger sons to younger brothers revolted tapsters and ostlers tradefallen the cankers of a calm world and a long peace ten times more dishonorable ragged than an old feazed ancient and such have i to fill up the rooms of them as have bought out their services that you would think that i had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from swine keeping from eating draff and husks a mad fellow met me on the way and told me i had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies no eye hath seen such scarecrows i'll not march through coventry with them that's flat nay and the villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on for indeed i had the most of them out of prison there's not a shirt and a half in all my company and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald's coat without sleeves and the shirt to say the truth stolen from my host at saint albans or the red nose innkeeper of daventry but that's all one they'll find linen enough on every hedge what hal how now mad wag what a devil dost thou in warwickshire my good lord of westmoreland i cry you mercy i thought your honor had already been at shrewsbury tut never fear me i am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream mine hal mine tut tut good enough to toss food for powder food for powder they'll fill a pit as well as better tush man mortal men mortal men faith for their poverty i know not where they had that and for their bareness i am sure they never learned that of me what is the king encamped well to the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast fits a dull fighter and a keen guest rebellion lay in his way and he found it hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me so 'tis a point of friendship i would 'twere bedtime hal and all well 'tis not due yet i would be loath to pay him before his day what need i be so forward with him that calls not on me well 'tis no matter honor pricks me on yea but how if honor prick me off when i come on how then can honor set to a leg no or an arm no or take away the grief of a wound no honor hath no skill in surgery then no what is honor a word what is in that word honor what is that honor air a trim reckoning who hath it he that died o' wednesday doth he feel it no doth he hear it no 'tis insensible then yea to the dead but will it not live with the living no why detraction will not suffer it therefore i'll none of it honor is a mere scutcheon and so ends my catechism though i could 'scape shot free at london i fear the shot here here's no scoring but upon the pate soft who are you sir walter blunt there's honor for you here's no vanity i am as hot as molten lead and as heavy too god keep lead out of me i need no more weight than mine own bowels i have led my ragamuffins where they are peppered there's not three of my hundred and fifty left alive and they are for the town's end to beg during life but who comes here o hal i prithee give me leave to breathe awhile turk gregory never did such deeds in arms as i have done this day i have paid percy i have made him sure nay before god hal if percy be alive thou gett'st not my sword but take my pistol if thou wilt ay hal 'tis hot 'tis hot there's that will sack a city well if percy be alive i'll pierce him if he do come in my way so if he do not if i come in his willingly let him make a carbonado of me i like not such grinning honor as sir walter hath give me life which if i can save so if not honor comes unlooked for and there's an end well said hal to it hal nay you shall find no boys' play here i can tell you emboweled if thou embowel me today i'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too tomorrow 'sblood 'twas time to counterfeit or that hot termagant scot had paid me scot and lot too counterfeit i lie i am no counterfeit to die is to be a counterfeit for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and perfect image of life indeed the better part of valor is discretion in the which better part i have saved my life zounds i am afraid of this gunpowder percy though he be dead how if he should counterfeit too and rise by my faith i am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit therefore i'll make him sure yea and i'll swear i killed him why may not he rise as well as i nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me therefore sirrah with a new wound in your thigh come you along with me no that's certain i am not a double man but if i be not jack falstaff then am i a jack there is percy if your father will do me any honor so if not let him kill the next percy himself i look to be either earl or duke i can assure you didst thou lord lord how this world is given to lying i grant you i was down and out of breath and so was he but we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by shrewsbury clock if i may be believed so if not let them that should reward valor bear the sin upon their own heads i'll take it upon my death i gave him this wound in the thigh if the man were alive and would deny it zounds i would make him eat a piece of my sword i'll follow as they say for reward he that rewards me god reward him if i do grow great i'll grow less for i'll purge and leave sack and live cleanly as a nobleman should do
