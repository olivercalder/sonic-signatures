though no man lesser fears the greeks than i as far as toucheth my particular yet dread priam there is no lady of more softer bowels more spongy to suck in the sense of fear more ready to cry out who knows what follows than hector is the wound of peace is surety surety secure but modest doubt is called the beacon of the wise the tent that searches to th' bottom of the worst let helen go since the first sword was drawn about this question every tithe soul 'mongst many thousand dismes hath been as dear as helen i mean of ours if we have lost so many tenths of ours to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us had it our name the value of one ten  what merit's in that reason which denies the yielding of her up brother she is not worth what she doth cost the keeping but value dwells not in particular will it holds his estimate and dignity as well wherein 'tis precious of itself as in the prizer 'tis mad idolatry to make the service greater than the god and the will dotes that is attributive to what infectiously itself affects without some image of th' affected merit it is cassandra peace sister peace now youthful troilus do not these high strains of divination in our sister work some touches of remorse or is your blood so madly hot that no discourse of reason nor fear of bad success in a bad cause can qualify the same paris and troilus you have both said well and on the cause and question now in hand have glozed but superficially not much unlike young men whom aristotle thought unfit to hear moral philosophy the reasons you allege do more conduce to the hot passion of distempered blood than to make up a free determination 'twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge have ears more deaf than adders to the voice of any true decision nature craves all dues be rendered to their owners now what nearer debt in all humanity than wife is to the husband if this law of nature be corrupted through affection and that great minds of partial indulgence to their benumb√®d wills resist the same there is a law in each well ordered nation to curb those raging appetites that are most disobedient and refractory if helen then be wife to sparta's king as it is known she is these moral laws of nature and of nations speak aloud to have her back returned thus to persist in doing wrong extenuates not wrong but makes it much more heavy hector's opinion is this in way of truth yet ne'ertheless my sprightly brethren i propend to you in resolution to keep helen still for 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependence upon our joint and several dignities i am yours you valiant offspring of great priamus i have a roisting challenge sent amongst the dull and factious nobles of the greeks will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits i was advertised their great

expecters of our trojan part desire them home give me thy hand my cousin i will go eat with thee and see your knights the worthiest of them tell me name by name but for achilles my own searching eyes

where thou wilt hit me dead wert thou an oracle to tell me so i'd not believe thee henceforth guard thee well for i'll not kill thee there nor there nor there but by the forge that stithied mars his helm i'll kill thee everywhere yea o'er and o'er  you wisest grecians pardon me this brag his insolence draws folly from my lips but i'll endeavor deeds to match these words or may i never  i pray you let us see you in the field we have had pelting wars since you refused the grecians' cause thy hand upon that match i trouble you thanks and good night to the greeks' general good night sweet lord menelaus give me your hand and so good night you train me to offend you get you in by all the everlasting gods i'll go no more i say ho bid my trumpet sound begone i say the gods have heard me swear
