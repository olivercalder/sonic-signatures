here my lord what mean you caesar think you to walk forth you shall not stir out of your house today caesar i never stood on ceremonies yet now they fright me there is one within besides the things that we have heard and seen recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch a lioness hath whelp√®d in the streets and graves have yawned and yielded up their dead fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds in ranks and squadrons and right form of war which drizzled blood upon the capitol the noise of battle hurtled in the air horses did neigh and dying men did groan and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets o caesar these things are beyond all use and i do fear them when beggars die there are no comets seen the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes alas my lord your wisdom is consumed in confidence do not go forth today call it my fear that keeps you in the house and not your own we'll send mark antony to the senate house and he shall say you are not well today let me upon my knee prevail in this say he is sick
