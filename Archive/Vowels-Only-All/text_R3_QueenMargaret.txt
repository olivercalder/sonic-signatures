darkness folded up your aerie buildeth in our aerie's nest o god that seest it do not suffer it as it is won with blood lost be it so urge neither charity nor shame to me uncharitably with me have you

and hell have set their marks on him and all their ministers attend on him what dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel and soothe the devil that i warn thee from o but remember this another day when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow and say poor margaret was a prophetess  live each of you the subjects to his hate and he to yours and all of you to god's so now prosperity begins to mellow and drop into the rotten mouth of death here in these confines slyly have i lurked to watch the waning of mine enemies a dire induction am i witness to and will to france hoping the consequence will prove as bitter black and tragical withdraw thee wretched margaret who comes here hover about her say that right for right hath dimmed your infant morn to agèd night plantagenet doth quit plantagenet edward for edward pays a dying debt when holy harry died and my sweet son if ancient sorrow be most reverend give mine the benefit of seigniory and let my griefs frown on the upper hand if sorrow can admit society tell over your woes again by viewing mine i had an edward till a richard killed him i had a husband till a richard killed him thou hadst an edward till a richard killed him thou hadst a richard till a richard killed him thou hadst a clarence too and richard killed him from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept a hellhound that doth hunt us all to death  that dog that had his teeth before his eyes to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood that excellent grand tyrant of the earth that reigns in gallèd eyes of weeping souls that foul defacer of god's handiwork thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves o upright just and true disposing god how do i thank thee that this carnal cur preys on the issue of his mother's body and makes her pew fellow with others' moan bear with me i am hungry for revenge and now i cloy me with beholding it thy edward he is dead that killed my edward thy other edward dead to quit my edward young york he is but boot because both they matched not the high perfection of my loss thy clarence he is dead that stabbed my edward and the beholders of this frantic play th' adulterate hastings rivers vaughan grey untimely smothered in their dusky graves richard yet lives hell's black intelligencer only reserved their factor to buy souls and send them thither but at hand at hand ensues his piteous and unpitied end earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray to have him suddenly conveyed from hence cancel his bond of life dear god i pray that i may live and say the dog is dead i called thee then vain flourish of my fortune i called thee then poor shadow painted queen the presentation of but what i was the flattering index of a direful pageant one heaved a high to be hurled down below a mother only mocked with two fair babes a dream of what thou wast a garish flag to be the aim of every dangerous shot a sign of dignity a breath a bubble a queen in jest only to fill the scene where is thy husband now where be thy brothers where are thy two sons wherein dost thou joy who sues and kneels and says god save the queen where be the bending peers that flattered thee where be the thronging troops that followed thee decline all this and see what now thou art for happy wife a most distressèd widow for joyful mother one that wails the name for one being sued to one that humbly sues for queen a very caitiff crowned with care for she that scorned at me now scorned of me for she being feared of all now fearing one for she commanding all obeyed of none thus hath the course of justice whirled about and left thee but a very prey to time having no more but thought of what thou wast to torture thee the more being what thou art thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not usurp the just proportion of my sorrow now thy proud neck bears half my burdened yoke from which even here i slip my weary head and leave the burden of it all on thee farewell york's wife and queen of sad mischance these english woes shall make me smile in france forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days compare dead happiness with living woe think that thy babes were sweeter than they were and he that slew them fouler than he is bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse revolving this will teach thee how to curse thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine
