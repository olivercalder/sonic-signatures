hast thou of me as she is for a wife i will anon first let us go to dinner no pray thee let it serve for table talk then howsome'er thou speak'st 'mong other things i shall digest it the moon shines bright in such a night as this when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise in such a night troilus methinks mounted the trojan walls and sighed his soul toward the grecian tents where cressid lay that night in such a night stood dido with a willow in her hand upon the wild sea banks and waft her love to come again to carthage in such a night did jessica steal from the wealthy jew and with an unthrift love did run from venice as far as belmont in such a night did pretty jessica like a little shrew slander her love and he forgave it her who comes so fast in silence of the night a friend what friend your name i pray you friend who comes with her he is not nor we have not heard from him  but go we in i pray thee jessica and ceremoniously let us prepare some welcome for the mistress of the house who calls leave holloaing man here here let's in and there expect their coming and yet no matter why should we go in  my friend stephano signify i pray you within the house your mistress is at hand and bring your music forth into the air how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony sit jessica look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold there's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st but in his motion like an angel sings still choiring to the young eyed cherubins such harmony is in immortal souls but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it come ho and wake diana with a hymn with sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear and draw her home with music the reason is your spirits are attentive for do but note a wild and wanton herd or race of youthful and unhandled colts fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud which is the hot condition of their blood if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since naught so stockish hard and full of rage but music for the time doth change his nature the man that hath no music in himself nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus let no such man be trusted mark the music that is the voice or i am much deceived of portia dear lady welcome home madam they are not yet but there is come a messenger before to signify their coming your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet we are no tell tales madam fear you not fair ladies you drop manna in the way of starvèd people
