as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search 'tis not unknown to you antonio how much i have disabled mine estate by something showing a more swelling port than my faint means would grant continuance nor do i now make moan to be abridged from such a noble rate but my chief care is to come fairly off from the great debts wherein my time something too prodigal hath left me gaged to you antonio i owe the most in money and in love and from your love i have a warranty to unburden all my plots and purposes how to get clear of all the debts i owe in my school days when i had lost one shaft i shot his fellow of the selfsame flight the selfsame way with more advisèd watch to find the other forth and by adventuring both i oft found both i urge this childhood proof because what follows is pure innocence i owe you much and like a willful youth that which i owe is lost but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first i do not doubt as i will watch the aim or to find both or bring your latter hazard back again and thankfully rest debtor for the first in belmont is a lady richly left and she is fair and fairer than that word of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes i did receive fair speechless messages her name is portia nothing undervalued to cato's daughter brutus' portia nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth for the four winds blow in from every coast renownèd suitors and her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden fleece which makes her seat of belmont colchos' strond and many jasons come in quest of her o my antonio had i but the means to hold a rival place with one of them i have a mind presages me such thrift that i should questionless be fortunate ay sir for three months for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound may you stead me will you pleasure me shall i know your answer your

these letters delivered put the liveries to making and desire gratiano to come anon to my lodging gramercy wouldst thou aught with me one speak for both what would you i know thee well thou hast

being bought and orderly bestowed return in haste for i do feast tonight my best esteemed acquaintance hie thee go gratiano you have obtained it why then you must but hear thee gratiano thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice  parts that become thee happily enough and in such eyes as ours appear not faults but where thou art not known why there they show something too liberal pray thee take pain to allay with some cold drops of modesty thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behavior i be misconstered in the place i go to and lose my hopes well we shall see your bearing no that were pity i would entreat you rather to put on your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends that purpose merriment but fare you well i have some business let me choose for as i am i live upon the rack

truth confess and love had been the very sum of my confession o happy torment when my torturer doth teach me answers for deliverance but let me to my fortune and the caskets so may the outward shows be least themselves the world is still deceived with ornament in law what plea so tainted and corrupt but being seasoned with a gracious voice obscures the show of evil in religion what damnèd error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts how many cowards whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins the beards of hercules and frowning mars who inward searched have livers white as milk and these assume but valor's excrement to render them redoubted look on beauty and you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight which therein works a miracle in nature making them lightest that wear most of it so are those crispèd snaky golden locks which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind upon supposèd fairness often known to be the dowry of a second head the skull that bred them in the sepulcher thus ornament is but the guilèd shore to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty in a word the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest therefore then thou gaudy gold hard food for midas i will none of thee nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge 'tween man and man but thou thou meager lead which rather threaten'st than dost promise aught thy paleness moves me more than eloquence and here choose i joy be the consequence what find i here fair portia's counterfeit what demigod hath come so near creation move these eyes or whether riding on the balls of mine seem they in motion here are severed lips parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar should sunder such sweet friends here in her hairs the painter plays the spider and hath woven a golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes how could he see to do them having made one methinks it should have power to steal both his and leave itself unfurnished yet look how far the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow in underprizing it so far this shadow doth limp behind the substance here's the scroll the continent and summary of my fortune you that choose not by the view chance as fair and choose as true since this fortune falls to you be content and seek no new if you be well pleased with this and hold your fortune for your bliss turn you where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss a gentle scroll fair lady by your leave i come by note to give and to receive like one of two contending in a prize that thinks he hath done well in people's eyes hearing applause and universal shout giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt whether those peals of praise be his or no so thrice fair lady stand i even so as doubtful whether what i see be true until confirmed signed ratified by you madam you have bereft me of all words only my blood speaks to you in my veins and there is such confusion in my powers as after some oration fairly spoke by a belovèd prince there doth appear among the buzzing pleasèd multitude where every something being blent together turns to a wild of nothing save of joy expressed and not expressed but when this ring parts from this finger then parts life from hence o then be bold to say bassanio's dead with all my heart so thou canst get a wife and do you gratiano mean good faith our feast shall be much honored in your

it for him in the court yea twice the sum if that will not suffice i will be bound to pay it ten times o'er on forfeit of my hands my head my heart if this will not suffice it must appear that malice bears down truth and i beseech you wrest once the law to your authority to do a great right do a little wrong and curb this cruel devil of his will antonio i am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself but life itself my wife and all the world are not with me esteemed above thy life i would lose all ay sacrifice them all here to this devil to deliver you here is the money i have it

with the antipodes if you would walk in absence of the sun i thank you madam give welcome to my friend this is the man this is antonio to whom i am so infinitely bound why i were best to cut my left hand off and swear i lost the ring defending it if i could add a lie unto a fault i would deny it but you see my finger hath not the ring upon it it is gone sweet portia if you did know to whom i gave the ring if you did know for whom i gave the ring and would conceive for what i gave the ring and how unwillingly i left the ring when naught would be accepted but the ring you would abate the strength of your displeasure no by my honor madam by my soul no woman had it but a civil doctor which did refuse three thousand ducats of me and begged the ring the which i did deny him and suffered him to go displeased away even he that had held up the very life of my dear friend what should i say sweet lady i was enforced to send it after him i was beset with shame and courtesy my honor would not let ingratitude so much besmear it pardon me good lady for by these blessèd candles of the night had you been there i think you would have begged the ring of me to give the worthy doctor portia forgive me this enforcèd wrong and in the hearing of these many friends i swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes wherein i see myself  nay but hear me pardon this fault and by my soul i swear i never more will break an oath with thee by heaven it is the same i gave the doctor were you the doctor and i knew you not sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow when i am absent then lie with my wife
