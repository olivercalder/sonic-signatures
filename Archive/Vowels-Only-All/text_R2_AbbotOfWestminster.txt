a woeful pageant have we here beheld my lord before i freely speak my mind herein you shall not only take the sacrament to bury mine intents but also to effect whatever i shall happen to devise i see your brows are full of discontent your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears come home with me to supper i'll lay a plot shall show us all a merry day
