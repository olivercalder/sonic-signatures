you have fought together it is your former promise noble martius breathe you my friends well fought we are come off like romans neither foolish in our stands nor cowardly in retire believe me sirs we shall be charged again whiles we have struck by interims and conveying gusts we have heard the charges of our friends the roman gods lead their successes as we wish our own that both our powers with smiling fronts encount'ring may give you thankful sacrifice thy news though thou speakest truth methinks thou speak'st not well how long is 't since 'tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour and bring thy news so late who's yonder that does appear as he were flayed o gods he has the stamp of martius and i have before time seen him thus the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor more than i know the sound of martius' tongue from every meaner man ay if you come not in the blood of others but mantled in your own flower of warriors how is 't with titus lartius where is that slave which told me they had beat you to your trenches where is he call him hither but how prevailed you martius we have at disadvantage fought and did retire to win our purpose as i guess martius their bands i' th' vaward are the antiates of their best trust o'er them aufidius their very heart of hope though i could wish you were conducted to a gentle bath and balms applied to you yet dare i never deny your asking take your choice of those that best can aid your action march on my fellows make good this ostentation and you shall divide in all with us if i should tell thee o'er this thy day's work thou 't not believe thy deeds but i'll report it where senators shall mingle tears with smiles where great patricians shall attend and shrug i' th' end admire where ladies shall be frighted and gladly quaked hear more where the dull tribunes that with the fusty plebeians hate thine honors shall say against their hearts we thank the gods our rome hath such a soldier yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast having fully dined before you shall not be the grave of your deserving rome must know the value of her own 'twere a concealment worse than a theft no less than a traducement to hide your doings and to silence that which to the spire and top of praises vouched would seem but modest therefore i beseech you  in sign of what you are not to reward what you have done before our army hear me should they not well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude and tent themselves with death of all the horses  whereof we have ta'en good and good store of all the treasure in this field achieved and city we render you the tenth to be ta'en forth before the common distribution at your only choice too modest are you more cruel to your good report than grateful to us that give you truly by your patience if 'gainst yourself you be incensed we'll put you like one that means his proper harm in manacles then reason safely with you therefore be it known as to us to all the world that caius martius wears this war's garland in token of the which my noble steed known to the camp i give him with all his trim belonging and from this time for what he did before corioles call him with all th' applause and clamor of the host martius caius coriolanus bear th' addition nobly ever so to our tent where ere we do repose us we will write to rome of our success you titus lartius must to corioles back send us to rome the best with whom we may articulate for their own good and ours take 't 'tis yours what is 't o well begged were he the butcher of my son he should be free as is the wind deliver him titus go we to our tent the blood upon your visage dries 'tis time it should be looked to come look sir your mother ever right on to the capitol i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus should not be uttered feebly it is held that valor is the chiefest virtue and most dignifies the haver if it be the man i speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised at sixteen years when tarquin made a head for rome he fought beyond the mark of others our then dictator whom with all praise i point at saw him fight when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him he bestrid an o'erpressed roman and i' th' consul's view slew three opposers tarquin's self he met and struck him on his knee in that day's feats when he might act the woman in the scene he proved best man i' th' field and for his meed was brow bound with the oak his pupil age man entered thus he waxèd like a sea and in the brunt of seventeen battles since he lurched all swords of the garland for this last before and in corioles let me say i cannot speak him home he stopped the flyers and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport as weeds before a vessel under sail so men obeyed and fell below his stem his sword death's stamp where it did mark it took from face to foot he was a thing of blood whose every motion was timed with dying cries alone he entered the mortal gate o' th' city which he painted with shunless destiny aidless came off and with a sudden reinforcement struck corioles like a planet now all's his when by and by the din of war gan pierce his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit requickened what in flesh was fatigate and to the battle came he where he did run reeking o'er the lives of men as if 'twere a perpetual spoil and till we called both field and city ours he never stood to ease his breast with panting our spoils he kicked at and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world he covets less than misery itself would give rewards his deeds with doing them and is content to spend the time to end it they are worn lord consul so that we shall hardly in our ages see their banners wave again hath he not passed the noble and the common you are like to do such business the people are abused set on this palt'ring becomes not rome nor has coriolanus deserved this so dishonored rub laid falsely i' th' plain way of his merit 'twas from the canon well on to th' marketplace agèd sir hands off peace peace peace stay hold peace come sir along with us but now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic and manhood is called foolery when it stands against a falling fabric will you hence before the tag return whose rage doth rend like interrupted waters and o'erbear what they are used to bear nay come away i have been i' th' marketplace and sir 'tis fit you make strong party or defend yourself by calmness or by absence all's in anger i think 'twill serve if he can thereto frame his spirit come come we'll prompt you away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself to answer mildly for they are prepared with accusations as i hear more strong than are upon you yet well well no more know i pray you  hear me my masters and my common friends  let me speak i have been consul and can show for rome her enemies' marks upon me i do love my country's good with a respect more tender more holy and profound than mine own life my dear wife's estimate her womb's increase and treasure of my loins then if i would speak that  i'll follow thee a month devise with thee where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us and we of thee so if the time thrust forth a cause for thy repeal we shall not send o'er the vast world to seek a single man and lose advantage which doth ever cool i' th' absence of the needer o you have made good work you have holp to ravish your own daughters and to melt the city leads upon your pates to see your wives dishonored to your noses  your temples burnèd in their cement and your franchises whereon you stood confined into an auger's bore if he is their god he leads them like a thing made by some other deity than nature that shapes man better and they follow him against us brats with no less confidence than boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies he'll shake your rome about your ears ay and you'll look pale before you find it other all the regions do smilingly revolt and who resists are mocked for valiant ignorance and perish constant fools who is 't can blame him your enemies and his find something in him who shall ask it the tribunes cannot do 't for shame the people deserve such pity of him as the wolf does of the shepherds for his best friends if they should say be good to rome they charged him even as those should do that had deserved his hate and therein showed like enemies you have brought a trembling upon rome such as was never s' incapable of help but i fear they'll roar him in again tullus aufidius the second name of men obeys his points as if he were his officer desperation is all the policy strength and defense that rome can make against them you're goodly things you voices o ay what else he would not seem to know me yet one time he did call me by my name i urged our old acquaintance and the drops that we have bled together coriolanus he would not answer to forbade all names he was a kind of nothing titleless till he had forged himself a name o' th' fire of burning rome i minded him how royal 'twas to pardon when it was less expected he replied it was a bare petition of a state to one whom they had punished i offered to awaken his regard for 's private friends his answer to me was he could not stay to pick them in a pile of noisome musty chaff he said 'twas folly for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt and still to nose th' offense he'll never hear him i tell you he does sit in gold his eye red as 'twould burn rome and his injury the jailor to his pity i kneeled before him 'twas very faintly he said rise dismissed me thus with his speechless hand what he would do he sent in writing after me what he would not bound with an oath to yield to his conditions so that all hope is vain unless his noble mother and his wife who as i hear mean to solicit him for mercy to his country therefore let's hence and with our fair entreaties haste them on
