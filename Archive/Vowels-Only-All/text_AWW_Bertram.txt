our success some dishonor we had in the loss of that drum but it is not to be recovered it might but it is not now why if you have a stomach to 't monsieur if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honor again into his native quarter be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on i will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness but you must not now slumber in it may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it i know thou 'rt valiant and to the possibility of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee farewell why do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto your brother he shall go along with me now will i lead you to the house and show you the lass i spoke of that's all the fault i spoke with her but once and found her wondrous cold but i sent to her by this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind tokens and letters which she did re send and this is all i have done she's a fair creature will you go see her they told me that your name was fontibell titled goddess and worth it with addition but fair soul in your fine frame hath love no quality if the quick fire of youth light not your mind you are no maiden but a monument when you are dead you should be such a one as you are now for you are cold and stern and now you should be as your mother was when your sweet self was got so should you be no more o' that i prithee do not strive against my vows i was compelled to her but i love thee by love's own sweet constraint and will forever do thee all rights of service how have i sworn change it change it be not so holy cruel love is holy and my integrity ne'er knew the crafts that you do charge men with stand no more off but give thyself unto my sick desires who then recovers say thou art mine and ever my love as it begins shall so persever i'll lend it thee my dear but have no power to give it from me it is an honor 'longing to our house bequeathèd down from many ancestors which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world in me to lose here take my ring my house mine honor yea my life be thine and i'll be bid by thee a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee i have tonight dispatched sixteen businesses a month's length apiece by an abstract of success i have congeed with the duke done my adieu with his nearest buried a wife mourned for her writ to my lady mother i am returning entertained my convoy and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs the last was the greatest but that i have not ended yet i mean the business is not ended as fearing to hear of it hereafter but shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier come bring forth this counterfeit module has deceived me like a double meaning prophesier no matter his heels have deserved it in usurping his spurs so long how does he carry himself nothing of me has he a plague upon him muffled he can say nothing of me all's one to him what a past saving slave is this but i con him no thanks for 't in the nature he delivers it what shall be done to him nay by your leave hold your hands though i know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls our interpreter does it well damnable both sides rogue he shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in 's forehead i could endure anything before but a cat and now he's a cat to me for this description of thine honesty a pox upon him for me he's more and more a cat a pox on him he's a cat still good morrow noble captain my high repented blames dear sovereign pardon to me admiringly my liege at first i stuck my choice upon her ere my heart durst make too bold a herald of my tongue where the impression of mine eye infixing contempt his scornful perspective did lend me which warped the line of every other favor scorned a fair color or expressed it stol'n extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object thence it came that she whom all men praised and whom myself since i have lost have loved was in mine eye the dust that did offend it hers it was not my gracious sovereign howe'er it pleases you to take it so the ring was never hers you are deceived my lord she never saw it in florence was it from a casement thrown me wrapped in a paper which contained the name of her that threw it noble she was and thought i stood ungaged but when i had subscribed to mine own fortune and informed her fully i could not answer in that course of honor as she had made the overture she ceased in heavy satisfaction and would never receive the ring again she never saw it if you shall prove this ring was ever hers you shall as easy prove that i husbanded her bed in florence where yet she never was my lord i neither can nor will deny but that i know them do they charge me further she's none of mine my lord my lord this is a fond and desp'rate creature whom sometime i have laughed with let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honor than for to think that i would sink it here she's impudent my lord and was a common gamester to the camp what of him he's quoted for a most perfidious slave with all the spots o' th' world taxed and debauched whose nature sickens but to speak a truth am i or that or this for what he'll utter that will speak anything i think she has certain it is i liked her and boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth she knew her distance and did angle for me madding my eagerness with her restraint as all impediments in fancy's course are motives of more fancy and in fine her infinite cunning with her modern grace subdued me to her rate she got the ring and i had that which any inferior might at market price have bought i have it not my lord i do confess the ring was hers both both o pardon if she my liege can make me know this clearly i'll love her dearly ever ever dearly
