before god i am exceeding weary faith it does me though it discolors the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer belike then my appetite was not princely got for by my troth i do now remember the poor creature small beer but indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness what a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name or to know thy face tomorrow or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast with these and those that were thy peach colored ones or to bear the inventory of thy shirts as one for superfluity and another for use but that the tennis court keeper knows better than i for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done a great while because the rest of the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland and god knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the midwives say the children are not in the fault whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily strengthened shall i tell thee one thing poins it shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine marry i tell thee it is not meet that i should be sad now my father is sick albeit i could tell to thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a better to call my friend i could be sad and sad indeed too by this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's book as thou and falstaff for obduracy and persistency let the end try the man but i tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow what wouldst thou think of me if i should weep it would be every man's thought and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks never a man's thought in the world keeps the roadway better than thine every man would think me an hypocrite indeed and what accites your most worshipful thought to think so and to thee and the boy that i gave falstaff he had him from me christian and look if the fat villain have not transformed him ape and yours most noble bardolph has not the boy profited instruct us boy what dream boy a crown's worth of good interpretation there 'tis boy and how doth thy master bardolph i do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog and he holds his place for

peace i will imitate the honorable romans in brevity i commend me to thee i commend thee and i leave thee be not too familiar with poins for he misuses thy favors so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister nell repent at idle times as thou mayst and so farewell thine by yea and no which is as much as to say as thou usest him jack falstaff with my familiars john with my brothers and sisters and sir john with all europe that's to make him eat twenty of his words but do you use me thus ned must i marry your sister well thus we play the fools with the time and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us is your master here in london where sups he doth the old boar feed in the old frank what company sup any women with him what pagan may that be even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull shall we steal upon them ned at supper sirrah you boy and bardolph no word to your master that i am yet come to town there's for your silence fare you well go this doll tearsheet should be some road how might we see falstaff bestow himself tonight in his true colors and not ourselves be seen from a god to a bull a heavy descension it was jove's case from a prince to a 'prentice a low transformation that shall be mine for in everything the purpose must weigh with the folly follow me ned would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off look whe'er the withered elder hath not his poll clawed like a parrot saturn and venus this year in conjunction what says th' almanac to that anon anon sir why thou globe of sinful continents what a life dost thou lead very true sir and i come to draw you out by the ears you whoreson candle mine you how vilely did you speak of me even now before this honest virtuous civil gentlewoman yea and you knew me as you did when you ran away by gad's hill you knew i was at your back and spoke it on purpose to try my patience i shall drive you then to confess the wilfull abuse and then i know how to handle you not to dispraise me and call me pantler and bread chipper and i know not what see now whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us is she of the wicked is thine hostess here of the wicked or is thy boy of the wicked or honest bardolph whose zeal burns in his nose of the wicked for the women you gentlewoman peto how now what news by heaven poins i feel me much to blame so idly to profane the precious time when tempest of commotion like the south borne with black vapor doth begin to melt and drop upon our bare unarmèd heads  give me my sword and cloak falstaff good night who saw the duke of clarence how now rain within doors and none abroad how doth the king heard he the good news yet tell it him if he be sick with joy he'll recover without physic no i will sit and watch here by the king why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow being so troublesome a bedfellow o polished perturbation golden care that keep'st the ports of slumber open wide to many a watchful night sleep with it now yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet as he whose brow with homely biggen bound snores out the watch of night o majesty when thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit like a rich armor worn in heat of day that scald'st with safety by his gates of breath there lies a downy feather which stirs not did he suspire that light and weightless down perforce must move my gracious lord my father this sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep that from this golden rigol hath divorced so many english kings thy due from me is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood which nature love and filial tenderness shall o dear father pay thee plenteously my due from thee is this imperial crown which as immediate from thy place and blood derives itself to me lo where it sits which god shall guard and put the world's whole strength into one giant arm it shall not force this lineal honor from me this from thee will i to mine leave as 'tis left to me i never thought to hear you speak again o pardon me my liege but for my tears the moist impediments unto my speech i had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard the course of it so far there is your crown and he that wears the crown immortally long guard it yours if i affect it more than as your honor and as your renown let me no more from this obedience rise which my most inward true and duteous spirit teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending god witness with me when i here came in and found no course of breath within your majesty how cold it struck my heart if i do feign o let me in my present wildness die and never live to show th' incredulous world the noble change that i have purposèd coming to look on you thinking you dead and dead almost my liege to think you were i spake unto this crown as having sense and thus upbraided it the care on thee depending hath fed upon the body of my father therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold other less fine in carat is more precious preserving life in med'cine potable but thou most fine most honored most renowned hast eat thy bearer up thus my most royal liege accusing it i put it on my head to try with it as with an enemy that had before my face murdered my father the quarrel of a true inheritor but if it did infect my blood with joy or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride if any rebel or vain spirit of mine did with the least affection of a welcome give entertainment to the might of it let god forever keep it from my head and make me as the poorest vassal is that doth with awe and terror kneel to it my gracious liege you won it wore it kept it gave it me then plain and right must my possession be which i with more than with a common pain 'gainst all the world will rightfully maintain my lord of warwick this new and gorgeous garment majesty sits not so easy on me as you think  brothers you mix your sadness with some fear this is the english not the turkish court not amurath an amurath succeeds but harry harry yet be sad good brothers for by my faith it very well becomes you sorrow so royally in you appears that i will deeply put the fashion on and wear it in my heart why then be sad but entertain no more of it good brothers than a joint burden laid upon us all for me by heaven i bid you be assured i'll be your father and your brother too let me but bear your love i'll bear your cares yet weep that harry's dead and so will i but harry lives that shall convert those tears by number into hours of happiness you all look strangely on me and you most you are i think assured i love you not no how might a prince of my great hopes forget so great indignities you laid upon me what rate rebuke and roughly send to prison th' immediate heir of england was this easy may this be washed in lethe and forgotten you are right justice and you weigh this well therefore still bear the balance and the sword and i do wish your honors may increase till you do live to see a son of mine offend you and obey you as i did so shall i live to speak my father's words happy am i that have a man so bold that dares do justice on my proper son and not less happy having such a son that would deliver up his greatness so into the hands of justice you did commit me for which i do commit into your hand th' unstainèd sword that you have used to bear with this remembrance that you use the same with the like bold just and impartial spirit as you have done 'gainst me there is my hand you shall be as a father to my youth my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear and i will stoop and humble my intents to your well practiced wise directions  and princes all believe me i beseech you my father is gone wild into his grave for in his tomb lie my affections and with his spirits sadly i survive to mock the expectation of the world to frustrate prophecies and to raze out rotten opinion who hath writ me down after my seeming the tide of blood in me hath proudly flowed in vanity till now now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea where it shall mingle with the state of floods and flow henceforth in formal majesty now call we our high court of parliament and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel that the great body of our state may go in equal rank with the best governed nation that war or peace or both at once may be as things acquainted and familiar to us in which you father shall have foremost hand our coronation done we will accite as i before remembered all our state and god consigning to my good intents no prince nor peer shall have just cause to say god shorten harry's happy life one day my lord chief justice speak to that vain man i know thee not old man fall to thy prayers how ill white hairs becomes a fool and jester i have long dreamt of such a kind of man so surfeit swelled so old and so profane but being awaked i do despise my dream make less thy body hence and more thy grace leave gormandizing know the grave doth gape for thee thrice wider than for other men reply not to me with a fool born jest presume not that i am the thing i was for god doth know so shall the world perceive  that i have turned away my former self so will i those that kept me company when thou dost hear i am as i have been approach me and thou shalt be as thou wast the tutor and the feeder of my riots till then i banish thee on pain of death as i have done the rest of my misleaders not to come near our person by ten mile for competence of life i will allow you that lack of means enforce you not to evils and as we hear you do reform yourselves we will according to your strengths and qualities give you advancement be it your charge my lord to see performed the tenor of my word  set on
