escalus of government the properties to unfold would seem in me t' affect speech and discourse since i am put to know that your own science exceeds in that the lists of all advice my strength can give you then no more remains but that to your sufficiency as your worth is able and let them work the nature of our people our city's institutions and the terms for common justice you're as pregnant in as art and practice hath enrichèd any that we remember there is our commission from which we would not have you warp call hither i say bid come before us angelo what figure of us think you he will bear for you must know we have with special soul elected him our absence to supply lent him our terror dressed him with our love and given his deputation all the organs of our own power what think you of it look where he comes angelo there is a kind of character in thy life that to th' observer doth thy history fully unfold thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues they on thee heaven doth with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us 'twere all alike as if we had them not spirits are not finely touched but to fine issues nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines herself the glory of a creditor both thanks and use but i do bend my speech to one that can my part in him advertise hold therefore angelo in our remove be thou at full ourself mortality and mercy in vienna live in thy tongue and heart old escalus though first in question is thy secondary take thy commission no more evasion we have with a leavened and preparèd choice proceeded to you therefore take your honors our haste from hence is of so quick condition that it prefers itself and leaves unquestioned matters of needful value we shall write to you as time and our concernings shall importune how it goes with us and do look to know what doth befall you here so fare you well to th' hopeful execution do i leave you of your commissions my haste may not admit it nor need you on mine honor have to do with any scruple your scope is as mine own so to enforce or qualify the laws as to your soul seems good give me your hand i'll privily away i love the people but do not like to stage me to their eyes though it do well i do not relish well their loud applause and aves vehement nor do i think the man of safe discretion that does affect it once more fare you well i thank you fare you well no holy father throw away that thought believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee to give me secret harbor hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth my holy sir none better knows than you how i have ever loved the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth and cost witless bravery keeps i have delivered to lord angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence my absolute power and place here in vienna and he supposes me traveled to poland for so i have strewed it in the common ear and so it is received now pious sir you will demand of me why i do this we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds which for this fourteen years we have let slip even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch only to stick it in their children's sight for terror not to use in time the rod more mocked than feared so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum i do fear too dreadful sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope 'twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment therefore indeed my father i have on angelo imposed the office who may in th' ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander and to behold his sway i will as 'twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people therefore i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear like a true friar more reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you only this one lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone hence shall we see if power change purpose what our seemers be hail to you provost so i think you are bound by my charity and my blest order i come to visit the afflicted spirits here in the prison do me the common right to let me see them and to make me know the nature of their crimes that i may minister to them accordingly when must he die repent you fair one of the sin you carry i'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience and try your penitence if it be sound or hollowly put on love you the man that wronged you so then it seems your most offenseful act was mutually committed then was your sin of heavier kind than his 'tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven showing we would not spare heaven as we love it but as we stand in fear  there rest your partner as i hear must die tomorrow and i am going with instruction to him grace go with you benedicite so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo be absolute for death either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep a breath thou art servile to all the skyey influences that doth this habitation where thou keep'st hourly afflict merely thou art death's fool for him thou labor'st by thy flight to shun and yet runn'st toward him still thou art not noble for all th' accommodations that thou bear'st are nursed by baseness thou 'rt by no means valiant for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provok'st yet grossly fear'st thy death which is no more thou art not thyself for thou exists on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou striv'st to get and what thou hast forget'st thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon if thou art rich thou 'rt poor for like an ass whose back with ingots bows thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey and death unloads thee friend hast thou none for thine own bowels which do call thee sire the mere effusion of thy proper loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an after dinner's sleep dreaming on both for all thy blessèd youth becomes as agèd and doth beg the alms of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant what's yet in this that bears the name of life yet in this life lie hid more thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes these odds all even dear sir ere long i'll visit you again provost a word with you bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed vouchsafe a word young sister but one word might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction i would require is likewise your own benefit son i have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practice his judgment with the disposition of natures she having the truth of honor in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make ready hold you there farewell provost a word with you that now you are come you will be gone leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair the assault that angelo hath made to you fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo how will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have you not heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea she should this angelo have married was affianced to her oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was wracked at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriage dowry with both her combinate husband this well seeming angelo left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonor in few bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonor in doing it this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience this being granted in course and now follows all we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honor untainted the poor mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt if you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof what think you of it it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction i will presently to saint luke's there at the moated grange resides this dejected mariana at that place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that it may be quickly o heavens what stuff is here and you good brother father what offense hath this man made you sir fie sirrah a bawd a wicked bawd the evil that thou causest to be done that is thy means to live do thou but think what 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back from such a filthy vice say to thyself from their abominable and beastly touches i drink i eat array myself and live canst thou believe thy living is a life so stinkingly depending go mend go mend nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin thou wilt prove his take him to prison officer correction and instruction must both work ere this rude beast will profit that we were all as some would seem to be from our faults as faults from seeming free still thus and thus still worse and you i know none can you tell me of any i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well he does well in 't it is too general a vice and severity must cure it how should he be made then you are pleasant sir and speak apace i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way 'tis not possible you do him wrong surely what i prithee might be the cause wise why no question but he was either this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own bringings forth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier therefore you speak unskillfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call upon you and i pray you your name he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you o you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i can do you little harm you'll forswear this again why should he die sir no might nor greatness in mortality can censure scape back wounding calumny the whitest virtue strikes what king so strong can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue but who comes here bliss and goodness on you not of this country though my chance is now to use it for my time i am a brother of gracious order late come from the see in special business from his holiness none but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accursed much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this news is old enough yet it is every day's news i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke what pleasure was he given to he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which i by my good leisure have discredited to him and now is he resolved to die if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced himself peace be with you he who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severe pattern in himself to know grace to stand and virtue go more nor less to others paying than by self offenses weighing shame to him whose cruel striking kills for faults of his own liking twice treble shame on angelo to weed my vice and let his grow o what may man within him hide though angel on the outward side how may likeness made in crimes making practice on the times to draw with idle spiders' strings most ponderous and substantial things craft against vice i must apply with angelo tonight shall lie his old betrothèd but despisèd so disguise shall by th' disguisèd pay with falsehood false exacting and perform an old contracting 'tis good though music oft hath such a charm to make bad good and good provoke to harm i pray you tell me hath anybody inquired for me here today much upon this time have i promised here to meet i do constantly believe you the time is come even now i shall crave your forbearance a little maybe i will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself very well met and welcome what is the news from this good deputy but shall you on your knowledge find this way are there no other tokens between you 'greed concerning her observance 'tis well borne up i have not yet made known to mariana a word of this what ho within come forth i pray you be acquainted with this maid she comes to do you good do you persuade yourself that i respect you take then this your companion by the hand who hath a story ready for your ear i shall attend your leisure but make haste the vaporous night approaches o place and greatness millions of false eyes are stuck upon thee volumes of report run with these false and most contrarious quest upon thy doings thousand escapes of wit make thee the father of their idle dream and rack thee in their fancies welcome how agreed it is not my consent but my entreaty too nor gentle daughter fear you not at all he is your husband on a precontract to bring you thus together 'tis no sin sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit come let us go our corn's to reap for yet our tithe's to sow the best and wholesom'st spirits of the night envelop you good provost who called here of late not isabel they will then ere 't be long there's some in hope not so not so his life is paralleled even with the stroke and line of his great justice he doth with holy abstinence subdue that in himself which he spurs on his power to qualify in others were he mealed with that which he corrects then were he tyrannous but this being so he's just now are they come this is a gentle provost seldom when the steelèd jailer is the friend of men how now what noise that spirit's possessed with haste that wounds th' unsisting postern with these strokes have you no countermand for claudio yet but he must die tomorrow as near the dawning provost as it is you shall hear more ere morning and here comes claudio's pardon this is his pardon purchased by such sin for which the pardoner himself is in hence hath offense his quick celerity when it is borne in high authority when vice makes mercy mercy's so extended that for the fault's love is th' offender friended now sir what news pray you let's hear what is that barnardine who is to be executed in th' afternoon how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him i have heard it was ever his manner to do so it is now apparent hath he borne himself penitently in prison how seems he to be touched he wants advice more of him anon there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him to make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four days' respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy in the delaying death by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions may be your guide let this barnardine be this morning executed and his head borne to angelo o death's a great disguiser and you may add to it shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common if anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against it with my life were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy you will think you have made no offense if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke you know the character i doubt not and the signet is not strange to you the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon overread it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenor perchance of the duke's death perchance entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ look th' unfolding star calls up the shepherd put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known call your executioner and off with barnardine's head i will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place yet you are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you come away it is almost clear dawn sir induced by my charity and hearing how hastily you are to depart i am come to advise you comfort you and pray with you o sir you must and therefore i beseech you look forward on the journey you shall go but hear you

provides dispatch it presently the hour draws on prefixed by angelo see this be done and sent according to command whiles i persuade this rude wretch willingly to die let this be done put them in secret holds both barnardine and claudio ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting to yonder generation you shall find your safety manifested quick dispatch and send the head to angelo now will i write letters to angelo  the provost he shall bear them whose contents shall witness to him i am near at home and that by great injunctions i am bound to enter publicly him i'll desire to meet me at the consecrated fount a league below the city and from thence by cold gradation and well balanced form we shall proceed with angelo convenient is it make a swift return for i would commune with you of such things that want no ear but yours the tongue of isabel she's come to know if yet her brother's pardon be come hither but i will keep her ignorant of her good to make her heavenly comforts of despair when it is least expected good morning to you fair and gracious daughter he hath released him isabel from the world his head is off and sent to angelo it is no other show your wisdom daughter

brother by himself and not have cut him off someone hath set you on confess the truth and say by whose advice thou cam'st here to complain i know you'd fain be gone an officer to prison with her shall

than he dare rack his own his subject am i not nor here provincial my business in this state made me a looker on here in vienna where i have seen corruption boil and bubble till it o'errun the stew

rash remonstrance of my hidden power than let him so be lost o most kind maid it was the swift celerity of his death which i did think with slower foot came on that brained my purpose but peace be with him that life is better life past fearing death than that which lives to fear make it your comfort so happy is your brother for this new married man approaching here whose salt imagination yet hath wronged your well defended honor you must pardon for mariana's sake but as he adjudged your brother  being criminal in double violation of sacred chastity and of promise breach thereon dependent for your brother's life  the very mercy of the law cries out most audible even from his proper tongue an angelo for claudio death for death haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure like doth quit like and measure still for measure  then angelo thy fault's thus manifested which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage we do condemn thee to the very block where claudio stooped to death and with like haste  away with him it is your husband mocked you with a husband consenting to the safeguard of your honor i thought your marriage fit else imputation for that he knew you might reproach your life and choke your good to come for his possessions although by confiscation they are ours we do instate and widow you with all to buy you a better husband never crave him we are definitive you do but lose your labor  away with him to death now sir to you against all sense you do importune her should she kneel down in mercy of this fact her brother's ghost his pavèd bed would

brother for his sake is he pardoned and for your lovely sake give me your hand and say you will be mine he is my brother too but fitter time for that by this lord angelo perceives he's safe methinks i see a quick'ning in his eye  well angelo your evil quits you well look that you love your wife her worth worth yours i find an apt remission in myself and yet here's one in place i cannot pardon you
