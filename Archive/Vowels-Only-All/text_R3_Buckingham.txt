good time of day unto your royal grace madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully ay madam he desires to make atonement between the duke of gloucester and your brothers and between them and my lord chamberlain and sent to warn them to his royal presence northumberland then present wept to see it peace peace for shame if not for charity have done have done nor no one here for curses never pass the lips of those that breathe them in the air nothing that i respect my gracious lord my hair doth stand an end to hear her curses whenever buckingham doth turn his hate upon your grace but with all duteous love doth cherish you and yours god punish me with hate in those where i expect most love when i have most need to employ a friend and most assurèd that he is a friend deep hollow treacherous and full of guile be he unto me this do i beg of god when i am cold in love to you or yours and in good time here comes sir richard ratcliffe and the duke look i so pale lord dorset as the rest we wait upon your grace you cloudy princes and heart sorrowing peers that bear this heavy mutual load of moan now cheer each other in each other's love though we have spent our harvest of this king we are to reap the harvest of his son the broken rancor of your high swoll'n hates but lately splintered knit and joined together must gently be preserved cherished and kept meseemeth good that with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fet hither to london to be crowned our king marry my lord lest by a multitude the new healed wound of malice should break out which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and yet ungoverned where every horse bears his commanding rein and may direct his course as please himself as well the fear of harm as harm apparent in my opinion ought to be prevented my lord whoever journeys to the prince for god's sake let not us two stay at home for by the way i'll sort occasion as index to the story we late talked of to part the queen's proud kindred from the prince welcome sweet prince to london to your chamber and in good time here comes the sweating lord fie what an indirect and peevish course is this of hers lord cardinal will your grace persuade the queen to send the duke of york unto his princely brother presently  if she deny lord hastings go with him and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce you are too senseless obstinate my lord too ceremonious and traditional weigh it but with the grossness of this age you break not sanctuary in seizing him the benefit thereof is always granted to those whose dealings have deserved the place and those who have the wit to claim the place this prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it then taking him from thence that is not there you break no privilege nor charter there oft have i heard of sanctuary men but sanctuary children never till now he did my gracious lord begin that place which since succeeding ages have re edified upon record my gracious lord what my gracious lord now in good time here comes the duke of york with what a sharp provided wit he reasons to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle he prettily and aptly taunts himself so cunning and so young is wonderful think you my lord this little prating york was not incensèd by his subtle mother to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously well let them rest come hither catesby thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend as closely to conceal what we impart thou knowest our reasons urged upon the way what thinkest thou is it not an easy matter to make william lord hastings of our mind for the installment of this noble duke in the seat royal of this famous isle what think'st thou then of stanley will not he well then no more but this go gentle catesby and as it were far off sound thou lord hastings how he doth stand affected to our purpose and summon him tomorrow to the tower to sit about the coronation if thou dost find him tractable to us encourage him and tell him all our reasons if he be leaden icy cold unwilling be thou so too and so break off the talk and give us notice of his inclination for we tomorrow hold divided councils wherein thyself shalt highly be employed good catesby go effect this business soundly now my lord what shall we do if we perceive lord hastings will not yield to our complots i'll claim that promise at your grace's hand what talking with a priest lord chamberlain your friends at pomfret they do need the priest your honor hath no shriving work in hand i do my lord but long i cannot stay there i shall return before your lordship thence and supper too although thou know'st it not  come will you go is all things ready for the royal time who knows the lord protector's mind herein who is most inward with the noble duke we know each other's faces for our hearts he knows no more of mine than i of yours or i of his my lord than you of mine  lord hastings you and he are near in love had you not come upon your cue my lord william lord hastings had pronounced your part  i mean your voice for crowning of the king withdraw yourself awhile i'll go with you tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian speak and look back and pry on every side tremble and start at wagging of a straw intending deep suspicion ghastly looks are at my service like enforcèd smiles and both are ready in their offices at any time to grace my stratagems but what is catesby gone lord mayor  hark a drum lord mayor the reason we have sent  god and our innocence defend and guard us well well he was the covert'st sheltered traitor that ever lived  would you imagine or almost believe were 't not that by great preservation we live to tell it that the subtle traitor this day had plotted in the council house to murder me and my good lord of gloucester i never looked for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore yet had we not determined he should die until your lordship came to see his end which now the loving haste of these our friends something against our meanings have prevented because my lord i would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treasons that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens who haply may misconster us in him and wail his death which since you come too late of our intent yet witness what you hear we did intend and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell doubt not my lord i'll play the orator as if the golden fee for which i plead were for myself and so my lord adieu i go and towards three or four o'clock look for the news that the guildhall affords now by the holy mother of our lord the citizens are mum say not a word i did with his contract with lady lucy and his contract by deputy in france th' unsatiate greediness of his desire and his enforcement of the city wives his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy as being got your father then in france and his resemblance being not like the duke withal i did infer your lineaments being the right idea of your father both in your form and nobleness of mind laid open all your victories in scotland your discipline in war wisdom in peace your bounty virtue fair humility indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose untouched or slightly handled in discourse and when mine oratory drew toward end i bid them that did love their country's good cry god save richard england's royal king no so god help me they spake not a word but like dumb statues or breathing stones stared each on other and looked deadly pale which when i saw i reprehended them and asked the mayor what meant this willful silence his answer was the people were not used to be spoke to but by the recorder then he was urged to tell my tale again thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferred  but nothing spoke in warrant from himself when he had done some followers of mine own at lower end of the hall hurled up their caps and some ten voices cried god save king richard and thus i took the vantage of those few thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i this general applause and cheerful shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard  and even here brake off and came away the mayor is here at hand intend some fear be not you spoke with but by mighty suit and look you get a prayer book in your hand and stand between two churchmen good my lord for on that ground i'll make a holy descant and be not easily won to our requests play the maid's part still answer nay and take it go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks welcome my lord i dance attendance here i think the duke will not be spoke withal now catesby what says your lord to my request return good catesby to the gracious duke tell him myself the mayor and aldermen in deep designs in matter of great moment no less importing than our general good are come to have some conference with his grace ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward he is not lolling on a lewd love bed but on his knees at meditation not dallying with a brace of courtesans but meditating with two deep divines not sleeping to engross his idle body but praying to enrich his watchful soul happy were england would this virtuous prince take on his grace the sovereignty thereof but sure i fear we shall not win him to it i fear he will here catesby comes again now catesby what says his grace sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him by heaven we come to him in perfect love and so once more return and tell his grace when holy and devout religious men are at their beads 'tis much to draw them thence so sweet is zealous contemplation two props of virtue for a christian prince to stay him from the fall of vanity and see a book of prayer in his hand true ornaments to know a holy man  famous plantagenet most gracious prince lend favorable ear to our requests and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal even that i hope which pleaseth god above and all good men of this ungoverned isle you have my lord would it might please your grace on our entreaties to amend your fault know then it is your fault that you resign the supreme seat the throne majestical the sceptered office of your ancestors your state of fortune and your due of birth the lineal glory of your royal house to the corruption of a blemished stock whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts which here we waken to our country's good the noble isle doth want her proper limbs  her face defaced with scars of infamy her royal stock graft with ignoble plants and almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion which to recure we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land not as protector steward substitute or lowly factor for another's gain but as successively from blood to blood your right of birth your empery your own for this consorted with the citizens your very worshipful and loving friends and by their vehement instigation in this just cause come i to move your grace my lord this argues conscience in your grace but the respects thereof are nice and trivial all circumstances well considerèd you say that edward is your brother's son so say we too but not by edward's wife for first was he contract to lady lucy  your mother lives a witness to his vow  and afterward by substitute betrothed to bona sister to the king of france these both put off a poor petitioner a care crazed mother to a many sons a beauty waning and distressèd widow even in the afternoon of her best days made prize and purchase of his wanton eye seduced the pitch and height of his degree to base declension and loathed bigamy by her in his unlawful bed he got this edward whom our manners call the prince more bitterly could i expostulate save that for reverence to some alive i give a sparing limit to my tongue then good my lord take to your royal self this proffered benefit of dignity if not to bless us and the land withal yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal true derivèd course refuse not mighty lord this proffered love if you refuse it as in love and zeal loath to depose the child your brother's son  as well we know your tenderness of heart and gentle kind effeminate remorse which we have noted in you to your kindred and equally indeed to all estates  yet know whe'er you accept our suit or no your brother's son shall never reign our king but we will plant some other in the throne to the disgrace and downfall of your house and in this resolution here we leave you  come citizens zounds i'll entreat no more then i salute you with this royal title long live richard england's worthy king tomorrow may it please you to be crowned tomorrow then we will attend your grace and so most joyfully we take our leave my gracious sovereign still live they and forever let them last say on my loving lord why so you are my thrice renownèd lord true noble prince your grace may do your pleasure give me some little breath some pause dear lord before i positively speak in this i will resolve you herein presently my lord i have considered in my mind the late request that you did sound me in i hear the news my lord my lord i claim the gift my due by promise for which your honor and your faith is pawned  th' earldom of hereford and the movables which you have promisèd i shall possess what says your highness to my just request my lord  my lord your promise for the earldom  my lord  i am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promised me upon the stroke of ten why let it strike why then resolve me whether you will or no and is it thus repays he my deep service with such contempt made i him king for this o let me think on hastings and be gone to brecknock while my fearful head is on will not king richard let me speak with him hastings and edward's children grey and rivers holy king henry and thy fair son edward vaughan and all that have miscarrièd by underhand corrupted foul injustice if that your moody discontented souls do through the clouds behold this present hour even for revenge mock my destruction  this is all souls' day fellow is it not why then all souls' day is my body's doomsday this is the day which in king edward's time i wished might fall on me when i was found false to his children and his wife's allies this is the day wherein i wished to fall by the false faith of him whom most i trusted this this all souls' day to my fearful soul is the determined respite of my wrongs that high all seer which i dallied with hath turned my feignèd prayer on my head and given in earnest what i begged in jest thus doth he force the swords of wicked men to turn their own points in their masters' bosoms thus margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck when he quoth she shall split thy heart with sorrow remember margaret was a prophetess  come lead me officers to the block of shame wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame the first was i that helped thee to the crown the last was i that felt thy tyranny o in the battle think on buckingham and die in terror of thy guiltiness dream on dream on of bloody deeds and death fainting despair despairing yield thy breath i died for hope ere i could lend thee aid but cheer thy heart and be thou not dismayed god and good angels fight on richmond's side and richard fall in height of all his pride
