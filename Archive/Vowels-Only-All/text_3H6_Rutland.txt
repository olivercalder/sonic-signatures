ah whither shall i fly to scape their hands ah tutor look where bloody clifford comes so looks the pent up lion o'er the wretch that trembles under his devouring paws and so he walks insulting o'er his prey and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder ah gentle clifford kill me with thy sword and not with such a cruel threat'ning look sweet clifford hear me speak before i die i am too mean a subject for thy wrath be thou revenged on men and let me live then let my father's blood open it again he is a man and clifford cope with him o let me pray before i take my death to thee i pray sweet clifford pity me i never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me but 'twas ere i was born thou hast one son for his sake pity me lest in revenge thereof sith god is just he be as miserably slain as i ah let me live in prison all my days and when i give occasion of offense then let me die for now thou hast no cause di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae
