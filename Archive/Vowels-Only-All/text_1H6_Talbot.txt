the duke of bedford had a prisoner called the brave lord ponton de santrailles for him was i exchanged and ransomèd but with a baser man of arms by far once in contempt they would have bartered me which i disdaining scorned and cravèd death rather than i would be so vile esteemed in fine redeemed i was as i desired but o the treacherous fastolf wounds my heart whom with my bare fists i would execute if i now had him brought into my power with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts in open marketplace produced they me to be a public spectacle to all here said they is the terror of the french the scarecrow that affrights our children so then broke i from the officers that led me and with my nails digged stones out of the ground to hurl at the beholders of my shame my grisly countenance made others fly none durst come near for fear of sudden death in iron walls they deemed me not secure so great fear of my name 'mongst them were spread that they supposed i could rend bars of steel and spurn in pieces posts of adamant wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had that walked about me every minute while and if i did but stir out of my bed ready they were to shoot me to the heart for aught i see this city must be famished or with light skirmishes enfeeblèd what chance is this that suddenly hath crossed us  speak salisbury at least if thou canst speak how far'st thou mirror of all martial men one of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off  accursèd tower accursèd fatal hand that hath contrived this woeful tragedy in thirteen battles salisbury o'ercame henry the fifth he first trained to the wars whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up his sword did ne'er leave striking in the field  yet liv'st thou salisbury though thy speech doth fail one eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace the sun with one eye vieweth all the world heaven be thou gracious to none alive if salisbury wants mercy at thy hands  sir thomas gargrave hast thou any life speak unto talbot nay look up to him  bear hence his body i will help to bury it salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort thou shalt not die whiles  he beckons with his hand and smiles on me as who should say when i am dead and gone remember to avenge me on the french plantagenet i will and like thee nero play on the lute beholding the towns burn wretched shall france be only in my name what stir is this what tumult's in the heavens whence cometh this alarum and the noise hear hear how dying salisbury doth groan it irks his heart he cannot be revenged frenchmen i'll be a salisbury to you pucelle or puzel dauphin or dogfish your hearts i'll stamp out with my horse's heels and make a quagmire of your mingled brains convey we salisbury into his tent and then try what these dastard frenchmen dare where is my strength my valor and my force our english troops retire i cannot stay them a woman clad in armor chaseth them here here she comes i'll have a bout with thee devil or devil's dam i'll conjure thee blood will i draw on thee thou art a witch  and straightway give thy soul to him thou serv'st heavens can you suffer hell so to prevail my breast i'll burst with straining of my courage and from my shoulders crack my arms asunder but i will chastise this high minded strumpet my thoughts are whirlèd like a potter's wheel i know not where i am nor what i do a witch by fear not force like hannibal  drives back our troops and conquers as she lists so bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench are from their hives and houses driven away they called us for our fierceness english dogs now like to whelps we crying run away hark countrymen either renew the fight or tear the lions out of england's coat renounce your soil give sheep in lions' stead sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf or horse or oxen from the leopard as you fly from your oft subduèd slaves it will not be retire into your trenches you all consented unto salisbury's death for none would strike a stroke in his revenge pucelle is entered into orleance in spite of us or aught that we could do o would i were to die with salisbury the shame hereof will make me hide my head lord regent and redoubted burgundy by whose approach the regions of artois walloon and picardy are friends to us this happy night the frenchmen are secure having all day caroused and banqueted embrace we then this opportunity as fitting best to quittance their deceit contrived by art and baleful sorcery a maid they say well let them practice and converse with spirits god is our fortress in whose conquering name let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks not all together better far i guess that we do make our entrance several ways that if it chance the one of us do fail the other yet may rise against their force and here will talbot mount or make his grave now salisbury for thee and for the right of english henry shall this night appear how much in duty i am bound to both bring forth the body of old salisbury and here advance it in the marketplace the middle center of this cursèd town now have i paid my vow unto his soul for every drop of blood was drawn from him there hath at least five frenchmen died tonight and that hereafter ages may behold what ruin happened in revenge of him within their chiefest temple i'll erect a tomb wherein his corpse shall be interred upon the which that everyone may read shall be engraved the sack of orleance the treacherous manner of his mournful death and what a terror he had been to france but lords in all our bloody massacre i muse we met not with the dauphin's grace his new come champion virtuous joan of arc nor any of his false confederates here is the talbot who would speak with him ne'er trust me then for when a world of men could not prevail with all their oratory yet hath a woman's kindness overruled  and therefore tell her i return great thanks and in submission will attend on her  will not your honors bear me company well then alone since there's no remedy i mean to prove this lady's courtesy  come hither captain you perceive my mind madam i have been bold to trouble you but since your ladyship is not at leisure i'll sort some other time to visit you marry for that she's in a wrong belief i go to certify her talbot's here prisoner to whom ha ha ha i laugh to see your ladyship so fond to think that you have aught but talbot's shadow whereon to practice your severity i am indeed no no i am but shadow of myself you are deceived my substance is not here for what you see is but the smallest part and least proportion of humanity i tell you madam were the whole frame here it is of such a spacious lofty pitch your roof were not sufficient to contain 't that will i show you presently how say you madam are you now persuaded that talbot is but shadow of himself these are his substance sinews arms and strength with which he yoketh your rebellious necks razeth your cities and subverts your towns and in a moment makes them desolate be not dismayed fair lady nor misconster the mind of talbot as you did mistake the outward composition of his body what you have done hath not offended me nor other satisfaction do i crave but only with your patience that we may taste of your wine and see what cates you have for soldiers' stomachs always serve them well france thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears if talbot but survive thy treachery pucelle that witch that damnèd sorceress hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares that hardly we escaped the pride of france foul fiend of france and hag of all despite encompassed with thy lustful paramours becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age and twit with cowardice a man half dead damsel i'll have a bout with you again or else let talbot perish with this shame dare you come forth and meet us in the field i speak not to that railing hecate but unto thee alanson and the rest will you like soldiers come and fight it out seigneur hang base muleteers of france like peasant footboys do they keep the walls and dare not take up arms like gentlemen and there will we be too ere it be long or else reproach be talbot's greatest fame  vow burgundy by honor of thy house pricked on by public wrongs sustained in france either to get the town again or die and i as sure as english henry lives and as his father here was conqueror as sure as in this late betrayèd town great coeur de lion's heart was burièd so sure i swear to get the town or die but ere we go regard this dying prince the valiant duke of bedford come my lord we will bestow you in some better place fitter for sickness and for crazy age undaunted spirit in a dying breast then be it so heavens keep old bedford safe  and now no more ado brave burgundy but gather we our forces out of hand and set upon our boasting enemy lost and recovered in a day again this is a double honor burgundy yet heavens have glory for this victory thanks gentle duke but where is pucelle now i think her old familiar is asleep now where's the bastard's braves and charles his gleeks what all amort roan hangs her head for grief that such a valiant company are fled now will we take some order in the town placing therein some expert officers and then depart to paris to the king for there young henry with his nobles lie but yet before we go let's not forget the noble duke of bedford late deceased but see his exequies fulfilled in roan a braver soldier never couchèd lance a gentler heart did never sway in court but kings and mightiest potentates must die for that's the end of human misery my gracious prince and honorable peers hearing of your arrival in this realm i have awhile given truce unto my wars to do my duty to my sovereign in sign whereof this arm that hath reclaimed to your obedience fifty fortresses twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength besides five hundred prisoners of esteem lets fall his sword before your highness' feet and with submissive loyalty of heart ascribes the glory of his conquest got first to my god and next unto your grace shame to the duke of burgundy and thee i vowed base knight when i did meet thee next to tear the garter from thy craven's leg which i have done because unworthily thou wast installèd in that high degree  pardon me princely henry and the rest this dastard at the battle of patay when but in all i was six thousand strong and that the french were almost ten to one before we met or that a stroke was given like to a trusty squire did run away in which assault we lost twelve hundred men myself and divers gentlemen besides were there surprised and taken prisoners then judge great lords if i have done amiss or whether that such cowards ought to wear this ornament of knighthood yea or no when first this order was ordained my lords knights of the garter were of noble birth valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage such as were grown to credit by the wars not fearing death nor shrinking for distress but always resolute in most extremes he then that is not furnished in this sort doth but usurp the sacred name of knight profaning this most honorable order and should if i were worthy to be judge be quite degraded like a hedge born swain that doth presume to boast of gentle blood content my liege yes but that i am prevented i should have begged i might have been employed i go my lord in heart desiring still you may behold confusion of your foes go to the gates of bordeaux trumpeter summon their general unto the wall english john talbot captains calls you forth servant in arms to harry king of england and thus he would open your city gates be humble to us call my sovereign yours and do him homage as obedient subjects and i'll withdraw me and my bloody power but if you frown upon this proffered peace you tempt the fury of my three attendants lean famine quartering steel and climbing fire who in a moment even with the earth shall lay your stately and air braving towers if you forsake the offer of their love he fables not i hear the enemy out some light horsemen and peruse their wings o negligent and heedless discipline how are we parked and bounded in a pale a little herd of england's timorous deer mazed with a yelping kennel of french curs if we be english deer be then in blood not rascal like to fall down with a pinch but rather moody mad and desperate stags turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel and make the cowards stand aloof at bay sell every man his life as dear as mine and they shall find dear deer of us my friends god and saint george talbot and england's right prosper our colors in this dangerous fight o young john talbot i did send for thee to tutor thee in stratagems of war that talbot's name might be in thee revived when sapless age and weak unable limbs should bring thy father to his drooping chair but o malignant and ill boding stars  now thou art come unto a feast of death a terrible and unavoided danger therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse and i'll direct thee how thou shalt escape by sudden flight come dally not be gone fly to revenge my death if i be slain if we both stay we both are sure to die shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb upon my blessing i command thee go part of thy father may be saved in thee thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain and leave my followers here to fight and die my age was never tainted with such shame then here i take my leave of thee fair son born to eclipse thy life this afternoon come side by side together live and die and soul with soul from france to heaven fly saint george and victory fight soldiers fight the regent hath with talbot broke his word and left us to the rage of france his sword where is john talbot pause and take thy breath i gave thee life and rescued thee from death when from the dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire it warmed thy father's heart with proud desire of bold faced victory then leaden age quickened with youthful spleen and warlike rage beat down alanson orleance burgundy and from the pride of gallia rescued thee the ireful bastard orleance that drew blood from thee my boy and had the maidenhood of thy first fight i soon encounterèd and interchanging blows i quickly shed some of his bastard blood and in disgrace bespoke him thus contaminated base and misbegotten blood i spill of thine mean and right poor for that pure blood of mine which thou didst force from talbot my brave boy here purposing the bastard to destroy came in strong rescue speak thy father's care art thou not weary john how dost thou fare wilt thou yet leave the battle boy and fly now thou art sealed the son of chivalry fly to revenge my death when i am dead the help of one stands me in little stead o too much folly is it well i wot to hazard all our lives in one small boat if i today die not with frenchmen's rage tomorrow i shall die with mickle age by me they nothing gain and if i stay 'tis but the short'ning of my life one day in thee thy mother dies our household's name my death's revenge thy youth and england's fame all these and more we hazard by thy stay all these are saved if thou wilt fly away then follow thou thy desp'rate sire of crete thou icarus thy life to me is sweet if thou wilt fight fight by thy father's side and commendable proved let's die in pride where is my other life mine own is gone o where's young talbot where is valiant john triumphant death smeared with captivity young talbot's valor makes me smile at thee when he perceived me shrink and on my knee his bloody sword he brandished over me and like a hungry lion did commence rough deeds of rage and stern impatience but when my angry guardant stood alone tend'ring my ruin and assailed of none dizzy eyed fury and great rage of heart suddenly made him from my side to start into the clust'ring battle of the french and in that sea of blood my boy did drench his over mounting spirit and there died my icarus my blossom in his pride thou antic death which laugh'st us here to scorn anon from thy insulting tyranny coupled in bonds of perpetuity two talbots wingèd through the lither sky in thy despite shall scape mortality  o thou whose wounds become hard favored death speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath brave death by speaking whither he will or no imagine him a frenchman and thy foe  poor boy he smiles methinks as who should say had death been french then death had died today  come come and lay him in his father's arms my spirit can no longer bear these harms soldiers adieu i have what i would have now my old arms are young john talbot's grave
