benedick didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato is she not a modest young lady no i pray thee speak in sober judgment thou thinkest i am in sport i pray thee tell me truly how thou lik'st her can the world buy such a jewel in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on i would scarce trust myself though i had sworn the contrary if hero would be my wife if this were so so were it uttered if my passion change not shortly god forbid it should be otherwise you speak this to fetch me in my lord and in faith my lord i spoke mine that i love her i feel and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will if this should ever happen thou wouldst be horn mad to the tuition of god from my house if i had it  my liege your highness now may do me good hath leonato any son my lord o my lord when you went onward on this ended action i looked upon her with a soldier's eye that liked but had a rougher task in hand than to drive liking to the name of love but now i am returned and that war thoughts have left their places vacant in their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires all prompting me how fair young hero is saying i liked her ere i went to wars how sweetly you do minister to love that know love's grief by his complexion but lest my liking might too sudden seem i would have salved it with a longer treatise you know me well i am he how know you he loves her thus answer i in name of benedick but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio 'tis certain so the prince woos for himself friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues let every eye negotiate for itself and trust no agent for beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melteth into blood this is an accident of hourly proof which i mistrusted not farewell therefore hero yea the same whither i wish him joy of her i pray you leave me if it will not be i'll leave you not sad my lord neither my lord silence is the perfectest herald of joy i were but little happy if i could say how much lady as you are mine i am yours i give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange and so she doth cousin tomorrow my lord time goes on crutches till love have all his rites and i my lord yea my good lord how still the evening is as hushed on purpose to grace harmony o very well my lord the music ended we'll fit the kid fox with a pennyworth o ay stalk on stalk on the fowl sits i did never think that lady would have loved any man faith like enough bait the hook well this fish will bite she did indeed he hath ta'en th' infection hold it up 'tis true indeed so your daughter says shall i says she that have so oft encountered him with scorn write to him that i love him now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of that then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses o sweet benedick god give me patience to what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse and she is exceeding wise hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness he is a very proper man before god and in my mind very wise and i take him to be valiant never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel if he do not dote on her upon this i will never trust my expectation i'll bring you thither my lord if you'll vouchsafe me i hope he be in love you must hang it first and draw it afterwards yet say i he is in love if he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs he brushes his hat o' mornings what should that bode no but the barber's man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls that's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love and when was he wont to wash his face nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops  nay but i know who loves him yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him 'tis even so hero and margaret have by this played their parts with beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet if there be any impediment i pray you discover it who hero disloyal may this be so if i see anything tonight why i should not marry her tomorrow in the congregation where i should wed there will i shame her o mischief strangely thwarting no know you any hero o what men dare do what men may do what men daily do not knowing what they do stand thee by friar father by your leave will you with free and unconstrainèd soul give me this maid your daughter and what have i to give you back whose worth may counterpoise this rich and precious gift sweet prince you learn me noble thankfulness  there leonato take her back again give not this rotten orange to your friend she's but the sign and semblance of her honor behold how like a maid she blushes here o what authority and show of truth can cunning sin cover itself withal comes not that blood as modest evidence to witness simple virtue would you not swear all you that see her that she were a maid by these exterior shows but she is none she knows the heat of a luxurious bed her blush is guiltiness not modesty not to be married not to knit my soul to an approvèd wanton i know what you would say if i have known her you will say she did embrace me as a husband and so extenuate the forehand sin no leonato i never tempted her with word too large but as a brother to his sister showed bashful sincerity and comely love out on thee seeming i will write against it you seem to me as dian in her orb as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown but you are more intemperate in your blood than venus or those pampered animals that rage in savage sensuality leonato stand i here is this the prince is this the prince's brother is this face hero's are our eyes our own let me but move one question to your daughter and by that fatherly and kindly power that you have in her bid her answer truly to make you answer truly to your name marry that can hero hero itself can blot out hero's virtue what man was he talked with you yesternight out at your window betwixt twelve and one now if you are a maid answer to this o hero what a hero hadst thou been if half thy outward graces had been placed about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart but fare thee well most foul most fair farewell thou pure impiety and impious purity for thee i'll lock up all the gates of love and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm and never shall it more be gracious good day to both of you who wrongs him marry beshrew my hand if it should give your age such cause of fear in faith my hand meant nothing to my sword my villainy away i will not have to do with you now signior what news we had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth we have been up and down to seek thee for we are high proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten away wilt thou use thy wit never any did so though very many have been beside their wit i will bid thee draw as we do the minstrels draw to pleasure us what courage man what though care killed a cat thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care nay then give him another staff this last was broke 'cross if he be he knows how to turn his girdle god bless me from a challenge well i will meet you so i may have good cheer i' faith i thank him he hath bid me to a calf's head and a capon the which if i do not carve most curiously say my knife's naught shall i not find a woodcock too for the which she wept heartily and said she cared not all all and moreover god saw him when he was hid in the garden yea and text underneath here dwells benedick the married man in most profound earnest and i'll warrant you for the love of beatrice most sincerely he is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a doctor to such a man hearken after their offense my lord rightly reasoned and in his own division and by my troth there's one meaning well suited i have drunk poison whiles he uttered it sweet hero now thy image doth appear in the rare semblance that i loved it first i know not how to pray your patience yet i must speak choose your revenge yourself impose me to what penance your invention can lay upon my sin yet sinned i not but in mistaking o noble sir your overkindness doth wring tears from me i do embrace your offer and dispose for henceforth of poor claudio tonight i'll mourn with hero is this the monument of leonato done to death by slanderous tongues was the hero that here lies death in guerdon of her wrongs gives her fame which never dies so the life that died with shame lives in death with glorious fame hang thou there upon the tomb praising her when i am dumb now music sound and sing your solemn hymn now unto thy bones goodnight yearly will i do this rite good morrow masters each his several way and hymen now with luckier issue speed 's than this for whom we rendered up this woe i'll hold my mind were she an ethiope i think he thinks upon the savage bull tush fear not man we'll tip thy horns with gold and all europa shall rejoice at thee as once europa did at lusty jove when he would play the noble beast in love for this i owe you here comes other reck'nings which is the lady i must seize upon why then she's mine sweet let me see your face give me your hand before this holy friar i am your husband if you like of me another hero and i'll be sworn upon 't that he loves her for here's a paper written in his hand a halting sonnet of his own pure brain fashioned to beatrice i had well hoped thou wouldst have denied beatrice that i might have cudgeled thee out of thy single life to make thee a double dealer which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee
