i do affect a sorrow indeed but i have it too o were that all i think not on my father and these great tears grace his remembrance more than those i shed for him what was he like i have forgot him my imagination carries no favor in 't but bertram's i am undone there is no living none if bertram be away 'twere all one that i should love a bright particular star and think to wed it he is so above me in his bright radiance and collateral light must i be comforted not in his sphere th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love 'twas pretty though a plague to see him every hour to sit and draw his archèd brows his hawking eye his curls in our heart's table heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favor but now he's gone and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his relics who comes here one that goes with him i love him for his sake and yet i know him a notorious liar think him a great way fool solely a coward yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him that they take place when virtue's steely bones looks bleak i' th' cold wind withal full oft we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly and you monarch and no ay you have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a question man is enemy to virginity how may we barricado it against him but he assails and our virginity though valiant in the defense yet is weak unfold to us some warlike resistance bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men i will stand for 't a little though therefore i die a virgin how might one do sir to lose it to her own liking not my virginity yet  there shall your master have a thousand loves a mother and a mistress and a friend a phoenix captain and an enemy a guide a goddess and a sovereign a counselor a traitress and a dear his humble ambition proud humility his jarring concord and his discord dulcet his faith his sweet disaster with a world of pretty fond adoptious christendoms that blinking cupid gossips now shall he  i know not what he shall god send him well the court's a learning place and he is one  that i wish well 'tis pity  that wishing well had not a body in 't which might be felt that we the poorer born whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes might with effects of them follow our friends and show what we alone must think which never returns us thanks monsieur parolles you were born under a charitable star i especially think under mars the wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born under mars when he was retrograde i think rather you go so much backward when you fight so is running away when fear proposes the safety but the composition that your valor and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing and i like the wear well our remedies oft in ourselves do lie which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky gives us free scope only doth backward pull our slow designs when we ourselves are dull what power is it which mounts my love so high that makes me see and cannot feed mine eye the mightiest space in fortune nature brings to join like likes and kiss like native things impossible be strange attempts to those that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose what hath been cannot be who ever strove to show her merit that did miss her love the king's disease my project may deceive me but my intents are fixed and will not leave me what is your pleasure madam mine honorable mistress that i am not pardon madam the count rossillion cannot be my brother i am from humble he from honored name no note upon my parents his all noble my master my dear lord he is and i his servant live and will his vassal die he must not be my brother you are my mother madam would you were  so that my lord your son were not my brother  indeed my mother or were you both our mothers i care no more for than i do for heaven so i were not his sister can 't no other but i your daughter he must be my brother good

poor but honest so 's my love be not offended for it hurts not him that he is loved of me i follow him not by any token of presumptuous suit nor would i have him till i do deserve him yet never know how that desert should be i know i love in vain strive against hope yet in this captious and intenible sieve i still pour in the waters of my love and lack not to lose still thus indian like religious in mine error i adore the sun that looks upon his worshipper but knows of him no more my dearest madam let not your hate encounter with my love for loving where you do but if yourself whose agèd honor cites a virtuous youth did ever in so true a flame of liking wish chastely and love dearly that your dian was both herself and love o then give pity to her whose state is such that cannot choose but lend and give where she is sure to lose that seeks not to find that her search implies but riddle like lives sweetly where she dies madam i had i will tell truth by grace itself i swear you know my father left me some prescriptions of rare and proved effects such as his reading and manifest experience had collected for general sovereignty and that he willed me in heedfull'st reservation to bestow them as notes whose faculties inclusive were more than they were in note amongst the rest there is a remedy approved set down to cure the desperate languishings whereof the king is rendered lost my lord your son made me to think of this else paris and the medicine and the king had from the conversation of my thoughts haply been absent then there's something in 't more than my father's skill which was the great'st of his profession that his good receipt shall for my legacy be sanctified by th' luckiest stars in heaven and would your honor but give me leave to try success i'd venture the well lost life of mine on his grace's cure by such a day an hour ay madam knowingly ay my good lord gerard de narbon was my father in what he did profess well found the rather will i spare my praises towards him knowing him is enough on 's bed of death many receipts he gave me chiefly one which as the dearest issue of his practice and of his old experience th' only darling he bade me store up as a triple eye safer than mine own two more dear i have so and hearing your high majesty is touched with that malignant cause wherein the honor of my dear father's gift stands chief in power i come to tender it and my appliance with all bound humbleness my duty then shall pay me for my pains i will no more enforce mine office on you humbly entreating from your royal thoughts a modest one to bear me back again what i can do can do no hurt to try since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy he that of greatest works is finisher oft does them by the weakest minister so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown when judges have been babes great floods have flown from simple sources and great seas have dried when miracles have by the great'st been denied oft expectation fails and most oft there where most it promises and oft it hits where hope is coldest and despair most shifts inspirèd merit so by breath is barred it is not so with him that all things knows as 'tis with us that square our guess by shows but most it is presumption in us when the help of heaven we count the act of men dear sir to my endeavors give consent of heaven not me make an experiment i am not an impostor that proclaim myself against the level of mine aim but know i think and think i know most sure my art is not past power nor you past cure the greatest grace lending grace ere twice the horses of the sun

lord is 't i that chase thee from thy country and expose those tender limbs of thine to the event of the none sparing war and is it i that drive thee from the sportive court where thou wast shot at with fair eyes to be the mark of smoky muskets o you leaden messengers that ride upon the violent speed of fire fly with false aim move the still 'pearing air that sings with piercing do not touch my lord whoever shoots at him i set him there whoever charges on his forward breast i am the caitiff that do hold him to 't and though i kill him not i am the cause his death was so effected better 'twere i met the ravin lion when he roared with sharp constraint of hunger better 'twere that all the miseries which nature owes were mine at once no come thou home rossillion whence honor but of danger wins a scar as oft it loses all i will be gone my being here it is that holds thee hence shall i stay here to do 't no no although the air of paradise did fan the house and angels officed all i

beseech you is this the way is it yourself i thank you and will stay upon your leisure i did so his name i pray you but by the ear that hears most nobly of him his face i know not ay surely mere the truth i know his lady what's his name o i believe with him in argument of praise or to the worth of the great count himself she is too mean to have her name repeated all her deserving is a reservèd honesty and that i have not heard examined how do you mean maybe the amorous count solicits her in the unlawful purpose which is the frenchman i like him well which is he perchance he's hurt i' th' battle i humbly thank you please it this matron and this gentle maid to eat with us tonight the charge and thanking shall be for me and to requite you further i will bestow some precepts of this virgin worthy the note if you misdoubt me that i am not she i know not how i shall assure you further but i shall lose the grounds i work upon nor would i wish you first give me trust the count he is my husband and what to your sworn counsel i have spoken is so from word to word and then you cannot by the good aid that i of you shall borrow err in bestowing it take this purse of gold and let me buy your friendly help thus far which i will overpay and pay again when i have found it the count he woos your daughter lays down his wanton siege before her beauty resolved to carry her let her in fine consent as we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it now his important blood will naught deny that she'll demand a ring the county wears that downward hath succeeded in his house from son to son some four or five descents since the first father wore it this ring he holds in most rich choice yet in his idle fire to buy his will it would not seem too dear howe'er repented after you see it lawful then it is no more but that your daughter ere she seems as won desires this ring appoints him an encounter in fine delivers me to fill the time herself most chastely absent after to marry her i'll add three thousand crowns to what is passed already why then tonight let us assay our plot which if it speed is wicked meaning in a lawful deed and lawful meaning in a lawful act where both not sin and yet a sinful fact but let's about it that you may well perceive i have not wronged you one of the greatest in the christian world shall be my surety 'fore whose throne 'tis needful ere i can perfect mine intents to kneel time was i did him a desirèd office dear almost as his life which gratitude through flinty tartar's bosom would peep forth and answer thanks i duly am informed his grace is at marseilles to which place we have convenient convoy you must know i am supposèd dead the army breaking my husband hies him home where heaven aiding and by the leave of my good lord the king we'll be before our welcome nor you mistress ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labor to recompense your love doubt not but heaven hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower as it hath fated her to be my motive and helper to a husband but o strange men that can such sweet use make of what they hate when saucy trusting of the cozened thoughts defiles the pitchy night so lust doth play with what it loathes for that which is away but more of this hereafter you diana under my poor instructions yet must suffer something in my behalf yet i pray you  but with the word the time will bring on summer when briers shall have leaves as well as thorns and be as sweet as sharp we must away our wagon is prepared and time revives us all's well that ends well still the fine's the crown whate'er the course the end is the renown but this exceeding posting day and night must wear your spirits low we cannot help it but since you have made the days and nights as one to wear your gentle limbs in my affairs be bold you do so grow in my requital as nothing can unroot you in happy time this man may help me to his majesty's ear if he would spend his power god save you sir sir i have seen you in the court of france i do presume sir that you are not fall'n from the report that goes upon your goodness and therefore goaded with most sharp occasions which lay nice manners by i put you to the use of your own virtues for the which i shall continue thankful that it will please you to give this poor petition to the king and aid me with that store of power you have to come into his presence not here sir all's well that ends well yet though time seem so adverse and means unfit  i do beseech you whither is he gone i do beseech you sir since you are like to see the king before me commend the paper to his gracious hand which i presume shall render you no blame but rather make you thank your pains for it i will come after you with what good speed our means will make us means and you shall find yourself to be well thanked whate'er falls more we must to horse again  go go provide no my good lord 'tis but the shadow of a wife you see the name and not the thing o my good lord when i was like this maid i found you wondrous kind there is your ring and look you here's your letterthis it says when from my finger you can get this ring and are by me with child etc this is done will you be mine
