what speech my good lord anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal matched pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th' unnervèd father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus' ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seemed i' th' air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus' pause arousèd vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops' hammers fall on mars's armor forged for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus' bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends but who ah woe had seen the moblèd queen  run barefoot up and down threat'ning the flames with bisson rheum a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood and for a robe about her lank and all o'erteemèd loins a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up  who this had seen with tongue in venom steeped 'gainst fortune's state would treason have pronounced but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband's limbs the instant burst of clamor that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods ay my lord ay my lord
