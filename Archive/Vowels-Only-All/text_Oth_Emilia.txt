you have little cause to say so you shall not write my praise how if fair and foolish good morrow good lieutenant i am sorry for your displeasure but all will sure be well the general and his wife are talking of it and she speaks for you stoutly the moor replies that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again pray you come in i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely good madam do i warrant it grieves my husband as if the cause were his madam here comes my lord i am glad i have found this napkin this was her first remembrance from the moor my wayward husband hath a hundred times wooed me to steal it but she so loves the token for he conjured her she should ever keep it that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to i'll have the work ta'en out and give 't iago what he will do with it heaven knows not i i nothing but to please his fantasy do not you chide i have a thing for you ha o is that all what will you give me now for that same handkerchief what handkerchief why that the moor first gave to desdemona that which so often you did bid me steal no faith she let it drop by negligence and to th' advantage i being here took 't up look here 'tis what will you do with 't that you have been so earnest to have me filch it if it be not for some purpose of import give 't me again poor lady she'll run mad when she shall lack it i know not madam is he not jealous look where he comes is not this man jealous 'tis not a year or two shows us a man they are all but stomachs and we all but food they eat us hungerly and when they are full they belch us look you cassio and my husband he went hence but now and certainly in strange unquietness pray heaven it be state matters as you think and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you but jealous souls will not be answered so they are not ever jealous for the cause but jealous for they're jealous it is a monster begot upon itself born on itself lady amen nor ever heard nor ever did suspect but then i saw no harm and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them never my lord never never my lord i durst my lord to wager she is honest lay down my soul at stake if you think other remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom if any wretch have put this in your head let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse for if she be not honest chaste and true there's no man happy the purest of their wives is foul as slander alas what does this gentleman conceive how do you madam how do you my good lady good madam what's the matter with my lord why with my lord madam he that is yours sweet lady here's a change indeed alas iago my lord hath so bewhored her thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her as true hearts cannot bear he called her whore a beggar in his drink could not have laid such terms upon his callet hath she forsook so many noble matches her father and her country and her friends to be called whore would it not make one weep i will be hanged if some eternal villain some busy and insinuating rogue some cogging cozening slave to get some office have not devised this slander i will be hanged else a halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones why should he call her whore who keeps her company what place what time what form what likelihood the moor's abused by some most villainous knave some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow o heaven that such companions thou 'dst unfold and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascals naked through the world even from the east to th' west o fie upon them some such squire he was that turned your wit the seamy side without and made you to suspect me with the moor how goes it now he looks gentler than he did dismiss me i would you had never seen him i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed come come you talk shall i go fetch your nightgown a very handsome man i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot to palestine for a touch of his nether lip it's the wind 'tis neither here nor there there be some such no question why would not you nor i neither by this heavenly light i might do 't as well i' th' dark the world's a huge thing it is a great price for a small vice in troth i think i should and undo 't when i had done it marry i would not do such a thing for a joint ring nor for measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition but for the whole world 'uds pity who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch i should venture purgatory for 't why the wrong is but a wrong i' th' world and having the world for your labor 'tis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it right yes a dozen and as many to th' vantage as would store the world they played for but i do think it is their husbands' faults if wives do fall say that they slack their duties and pour our treasures into foreign laps or else break out in peevish jealousies throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us or scant our former having in despite why we have galls and though we have some grace yet have we some revenge let husbands know their wives have sense like them they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have what is it that they do when they change us for others is it sport i think it is and doth affection breed it i think it doth is 't frailty that thus errs it is so too and have not we affections desires for sport and frailty as men have then let them use us well else let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us so alas what is the matter what is the matter husband alas good gentleman alas good cassio o fie upon thee strumpet as i faugh fie upon thee my lord my lord what ho my lord my lord what ho my lord my lord o good my lord i would speak a
