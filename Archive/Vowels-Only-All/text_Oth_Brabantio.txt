what is the reason of this terrible summons what is the matter there why wherefore ask you this what have you lost your wits not i what are you the worser welcome i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors in honest plainness thou hast heard me say my daughter is not for thee and now in madness being full of supper and distemp'ring draughts upon malicious bravery dost thou come to start my quiet but thou must needs be sure my spirit and my place have in them power to make this bitter to thee what tell'st thou me of robbing this is venice my house is not a grange what profane wretch art thou thou art a villain this thou shalt answer i know thee roderigo strike on the tinder ho give me a taper call up all my people this accident is not unlike my dream belief of it oppresses me already light i say light it is too true an evil gone she is and what's to come of my despisèd time is naught but bitterness now roderigo where didst thou see her o unhappy girl  with the moor sayst thou who would be a father  how didst thou know 'twas she o she deceives me past thought what said she to you get more tapers raise all my kindred are they married think you o heaven how got she out o treason of the blood fathers from hence trust not your daughters' minds by what you see them act is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused have you not read roderigo of some such thing call up my brother o would you had had her  some one way some another do you know where we may apprehend her and the moor pray you lead on at every house i'll call i may command at most get weapons ho and raise some special officers of night  on good roderigo i will deserve your pains down with him thief o thou foul thief where hast thou stowed my daughter damned as thou art thou hast enchanted her for i'll refer me to all things of sense if she in chains of magic were not bound whether a maid so tender fair and happy so opposite to marriage that she shunned the wealthy curlèd darlings of our nation would ever have t' incur a general mock run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight judge me the world if 'tis not gross in sense that thou hast practiced on her with foul charms abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weakens motion i'll have 't disputed on 'tis probable and palpable to thinking i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world a practicer of arts inhibited and out of warrant  lay hold upon him if he do resist subdue him at his peril to prison till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer how the duke in council in this time of the night bring him away mine's not an idle cause the duke himself or any of my brothers of the state cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own for if such actions may have passage free bondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be so did i yours good your grace pardon me neither my place nor aught i heard of business hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care take hold on me for my particular grief is of so floodgate and o'erbearing nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows and it is still itself my daughter o my daughter ay to me she is abused stol'n from me and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks for nature so prepost'rously to err  being not deficient blind or lame of sense  sans witchcraft could not humbly i thank your grace here is the man this moor whom now it seems your special mandate for the state affairs hath hither brought nothing but this is so a maiden never bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushed at herself and she in spite of nature of years of country credit everything to fall in love with what she feared to look on it is a judgment maimed and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature and must be driven to find out practices of cunning hell why this should be i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood or with some dram conjured to this effect he wrought upon her i pray you hear her speak if she confess that she was half the wooer destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man come hither gentle mistress do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience god be with you i have done please it your grace on to the state affairs i had rather to adopt a child than get it  come hither moor i here do give thee that with all my heart which but thou hast already with all my heart i would keep from thee for your sake jewel i am glad at soul i have no other child for thy escape would teach me tyranny to hang clogs on them i have done my lord so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow these sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the bruised heart was piercèd through the ear i humbly beseech you proceed to th' affairs of state i will not have it so look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see she has deceived her father and may thee
