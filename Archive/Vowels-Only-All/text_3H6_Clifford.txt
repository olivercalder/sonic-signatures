the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel patience is for poltroons such as he he durst not sit there had your father lived my gracious lord here in the parliament let us assail the family of york whom should he follow but his natural king urge it no more lest that instead of words i send thee warwick such a messenger as shall revenge his death before i stir king henry be thy title right or wrong lord clifford vows to fight in thy defense may that ground gape and swallow me alive where i shall kneel to him that slew my father what wrong is this unto the prince your son how hast thou injured both thyself and us come cousin let us tell the queen these news in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome or live in peace abandoned and despised chaplain away thy priesthood saves thy life as for the brat of this accursèd duke whose father slew my father he shall die soldiers away with him how now is he dead already or is it fear that makes him close his eyes i'll open them in vain thou speak'st poor boy my father's blood hath stopped the passage where thy words should enter had i thy brethren here their lives and thine were not revenge sufficient for me no if i digged up thy forefathers' graves and hung their rotten coffins up in chains it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart the sight of any of the house of york is as a fury to torment my soul and till i root out their accursèd line and leave not one alive i live in hell therefore  such pity as my rapier's point affords thy father hath no cause thy father slew my father therefore die plantagenet i come plantagenet and this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood congealed with this do make me wipe off both ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm with downright payment showed unto my father now phaëton hath tumbled from his car and made an evening at the noontide prick so cowards fight when they can fly no further so doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers i will not bandy with thee word for word but buckler with thee blows twice two for one ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin that is my office for my father's sake here's for my oath here's for my father's death my gracious liege this too much lenity and harmful pity must be laid aside to whom do lions cast their gentle looks not to the beast that would usurp their den whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick not his that spoils her young before her face who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting not he that sets his foot upon her back the smallest worm will turn being trodden on and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood ambitious york did level at thy crown thou smiling while he knit his angry brows he but a duke would have his son a king and raise his issue like a loving sire thou being a king blest with a goodly son didst yield consent to disinherit him which argued thee a most unloving father unreasonable creatures feed their young and though man's face be fearful to their eyes yet in protection of their tender ones who hath not seen them even with those wings which sometime they have used with fearful flight make war with him that climbed unto their nest offering their own lives in their young's defense for shame my liege make them your precedent were it not pity that this goodly boy should lose his birthright by his father's fault and long hereafter say unto his child what my great grandfather and grandsire got my careless father fondly gave away ah what a shame were this look on the boy and let his manly face which promiseth successful fortune steel thy melting heart to hold thine own and leave thine own with him why that is spoken like a toward prince i would your highness would depart the field the queen hath best success when you are absent and reason too who should succeed the father but the son ay crookback here i stand to answer thee or any he the proudest of thy sort ay and old york and yet not satisfied you said so much before and yet you fled i slew thy father call'st thou him a child my liege the wound that bred this meeting here cannot be cured by words therefore be still now richard i am with thee here alone this is the hand that stabbed thy father york and this the hand that slew thy brother rutland and here's the heart that triumphs in their death and cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother to execute the like upon thyself and so have at thee here burns my candle out ay here it dies which whiles it lasted gave king henry light o lancaster i fear thy overthrow more than my body's parting with my soul my love and fear glued many friends to thee and now i fall thy tough commixtures melts impairing henry strength'ning misproud york and whither fly the gnats but to the sun and who shines now but henry's enemies o phoebus hadst thou never given consent that phaëton should check thy fiery steeds thy burning car never had scorched the earth and henry hadst thou swayed as kings should do or as thy father and his father did giving no ground unto the house of york they never then had sprung like summer flies i and ten thousand in this luckless realm had left no mourning widows for our death and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds no way to fly no strength to hold out flight the foe is merciless and will not pity for at their hands i have deserved no pity the air hath got into my deadly wounds and much effuse of blood doth make me faint come york and richard warwick and the rest i stabbed your fathers' bosoms split my breast
