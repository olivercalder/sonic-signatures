your mind is tossing on the ocean there where your argosies with portly sail like signiors and rich burghers on the flood or as it were the pageants of the sea do overpeer the petty traffickers that curtsy to them do them reverence as they fly by them with their woven wings my wind cooling my broth would blow me to an ague when i thought what harm a wind too great might do at sea i should not see the sandy hourglass run but i should think of shallows and of flats and see my wealthy andrew docked in sand vailing her high top lower than her ribs to kiss her burial should i go to church and see the holy edifice of stone and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks which touching but my gentle vessel's side would scatter all her spices on the stream enrobe the roaring waters with my silks and in a word but even now worth this and now worth nothing shall i have the thought to think on this and shall i lack the thought that such a thing bechanced would make me sad but tell not me i know antonio is sad to think upon his merchandise i would have stayed till i had made you merry if worthier friends had not prevented me good morrow my good lords we'll make our leisures to attend on yours we have not spoke us yet of torchbearers ay marry i'll be gone about it straight 'tis good we do so his hour is almost past o ten times faster venus' pigeons fly to seal love's bonds new made than they are wont to keep obligèd faith unforfeited here comes lorenzo more of this hereafter why man i saw bassanio under sail with him is gratiano gone along and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not he came too late the ship was under sail but there the duke was given to understand that in a gondola were seen together lorenzo and his amorous jessica besides antonio certified the duke they were not with bassanio in his ship why all the boys in venice follow him crying his stones his daughter and his ducats marry well remembered i reasoned with a frenchman yesterday who told me in the narrow seas that part the french and english there miscarrièd a vessel of our country richly fraught i thought upon antonio when he told me and wished in silence that it were not his a kinder gentleman treads not the earth i saw bassanio and antonio part bassanio told him he would make some speed of his return he answered do not so slubber not business for my sake bassanio but stay the very riping of the time and for the jew's bond which he hath of me let it not enter in your mind of love be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts to courtship and such fair ostents of love as shall conveniently become you there and even there his eye being big with tears turning his face he put his hand behind him and with affection wondrous sensible he wrung bassanio's hand and so they parted do we so why yet it lives there unchecked that antonio hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the narrow seas the goodwins i think they call the place a very dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word come the full stop i would it might prove the end of his losses that's certain i for my part knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal that's certain if the devil may be her judge there is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory more between your bloods than there is between red wine and rhenish but tell us do you hear whether antonio have had any loss at sea or no why i am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh what's that good for we have been up and down to seek him
