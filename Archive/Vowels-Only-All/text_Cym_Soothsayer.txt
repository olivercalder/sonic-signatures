last night the very gods showed me a vision  i fast and prayed for their intelligence thus i saw jove's bird the roman eagle winged from the spongy south to this part of the west there vanished in the sunbeams which portends  unless my sins abuse my divination  success to th' roman host here my good lord whenas a lion's whelp shall to himself unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches which being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty thou leonatus art the lion's whelp the fit and apt construction of thy name being leo natus doth import so much the piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter which we call mollis aer and mollis aer we term it mulier which mulier i divine is this most constant wife who even now answering the letter of the oracle unknown to you unsought were clipped about with this most tender air the lofty cedar royal cymbeline personates thee and thy lopped branches point thy two sons forth who by belarius stol'n for many years thought dead are now revived to the majestic cedar joined whose issue promises britain peace and plenty the fingers of the powers above do tune the harmony of this peace the vision which i made known to lucius ere the stroke of this yet scarce cold battle at this instant is full accomplished for the roman eagle from south to west on wing soaring aloft lessened herself and in the beams o' th' sun so vanished which foreshowed our princely eagle th' imperial caesar should again unite his favor with the radiant cymbeline which shines here in the west
