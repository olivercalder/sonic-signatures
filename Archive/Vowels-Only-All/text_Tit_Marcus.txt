princes that strive by factions and by friends ambitiously for rule and empery know that the people of rome for whom we stand a special party have by common voice in election for the roman empery chosen andronicus surnamèd pius for many good and great deserts to rome a nobler man a braver warrior lives not this day within the city walls he by the senate is accited home from weary wars against the barbarous goths that with his sons a terror to our foes hath yoked a nation strong trained up in arms ten years are spent since first he undertook this cause of rome and chastisèd with arms our enemies' pride five times he hath returned bleeding to rome bearing his valiant sons in coffins from the field and now at last laden with honor's spoils returns the good andronicus to rome renownèd titus flourishing in arms let us entreat by honor of his name whom worthily you would have now succeed and in the capitol and senate's right whom you pretend to honor and adore that you withdraw you and abate your strength dismiss your followers and as suitors should plead your deserts in peace and humbleness long live lord titus my belovèd brother gracious triumpher in the eyes of rome and welcome nephews from successful wars  you that survive and you that sleep in fame fair lords your fortunes are alike in all that in your country's service drew your swords but safer triumph is this funeral pomp that hath aspired to solon's happiness and triumphs over chance in honor's bed  titus andronicus the people of rome whose friend in justice thou hast ever been send thee by me their tribune and their trust this palliament of white and spotless hue and name thee in election for the empire with these our late deceasèd emperor's sons be candidatus then and put it on and help to set a head on headless rome titus thou shalt obtain and ask the empery with voices and applause of every sort patricians and plebeians we create lord saturninus rome's great emperor and say long live our emperor saturnine suum cuique is our roman justice this prince in justice seizeth but his own o titus see o see what thou hast done in a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son my lord this is impiety in you my nephew mutius' deeds do plead for him he must be buried with his brethren no noble titus but entreat of thee to pardon mutius and to bury him brother for in that name doth nature plead  renownèd titus more than half my soul  suffer thy brother marcus to inter his noble nephew here in virtue's nest that died in honor and lavinia's cause thou art a roman be not barbarous the greeks upon advice did bury ajax that slew himself and wise laertes' son did graciously plead for his funerals let not young mutius then that was thy joy be barred his entrance here no man shed tears for noble mutius he lives in fame that died in virtue's cause my lord to step out of these dreary dumps how comes it that the subtle queen of goths is of a sudden thus advanced in rome that on mine honor here do i protest i have dogs my lord will rouse the proudest panther in the chase and climb the highest promontory top who is this my niece that flies away so fast  cousin a word where is your husband if i do dream would all my wealth would wake me if i do wake some planet strike me down that i may slumber an eternal sleep speak gentle niece what stern ungentle hands hath lopped and hewed and made thy body bare of her two branches those sweet ornaments whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in and might not gain so great a happiness as half thy love why dost not speak to me alas a crimson river of warm blood like to a bubbling fountain stirred with wind doth rise and fall between thy rosèd lips coming and going with thy honey breath but sure some tereus hath deflowered thee and lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue ah now thou turn'st away thy face for shame and notwithstanding all this loss of blood as from a conduit with three issuing spouts yet do thy cheeks look red as titan's face blushing to be encountered with a cloud shall i speak for thee shall i say 'tis so o that i knew thy heart and knew the beast that i might rail at him to ease my mind sorrow concealèd like an oven stopped doth burn the heart to cinders where it is fair philomela why she but lost her tongue and in a tedious sampler sewed her mind but lovely niece that mean is cut from thee a craftier tereus cousin hast thou met and he hath cut those pretty fingers off that could have better sewed than philomel o had the monster seen those lily hands tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute and make the silken strings delight to kiss them he would not then have touched them for his life or had he heard the heavenly harmony which that sweet tongue hath made he would have dropped his knife and fell asleep as cerberus at the thracian poet's feet come let us go and make thy father blind for such a sight will blind a father's eye one hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads what will whole months of tears thy father's eyes do not draw back for we will mourn with thee o could our mourning ease thy misery titus prepare thy agèd eyes to weep or if not so thy noble heart to break i bring consuming sorrow to thine age this was thy daughter o that delightful engine of her thoughts that blabbed them with such pleasing eloquence is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage where like a sweet melodious bird it sung sweet varied notes enchanting every ear o thus i found her straying in the park seeking to hide herself as doth the deer that hath received some unrecuring wound perchance she weeps because they killed her husband perchance because she knows them innocent patience dear niece good titus dry thine eyes which of your hands hath not defended rome and reared aloft the bloody battleax writing destruction on the enemy's castle o none of both but are of high desert my hand hath been but idle let it serve to ransom my two nephews from their death then have i kept it to a worthy end my hand shall go and for our father's sake and mother's care now let me show a brother's love to thee but i will use the ax o brother speak with possibility and do not break into these deep extremes but yet let reason govern thy lament now let hot etna cool in sicily and be my heart an everburning hell these miseries are more than may be borne to weep with them that weep doth ease some deal but sorrow flouted at is double death alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless as frozen water to a starvèd snake now farewell flatt'ry die andronicus thou dost not slumber see thy two sons' heads thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here thy other banished son with this dear sight struck pale and bloodless and thy brother i even like a stony image cold and numb ah now no more will i control thy griefs rent off thy silver hair thy other hand gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight the closing up of our most wretched eyes now is a time to storm why art thou still why dost thou laugh it fits not with this hour fie brother fie teach her not thus to lay such violent hands upon her tender life alas the tender boy in passion moved doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness at that that i have killed my lord a fly alas my lord i have but killed a fly pardon me sir it was a black ill favored fly like to the empress' moor therefore i killed him alas poor man grief has so wrought on him he takes false shadows for true substances stand by me lucius do not fear thine aunt what means my niece lavinia by these signs canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus lucius i will i think she means that there were more than one confederate in the fact ay more there was or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge for love of her that's gone perhaps she culled it from among the rest see brother see note how she quotes the leaves o why should nature build so foul a den unless the gods delight in tragedies sit down sweet niece brother sit down by me apollo pallas jove or mercury inspire me that i may this treason find  my lord look here look here lavinia this sandy plot is plain guide if thou canst this after me i have writ my name without the help of any hand at all cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift write thou good niece and here display at last what god will have discovered for revenge heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain that we may know the traitors and the truth o do you read my lord what she hath writ what what the lustful sons of tamora performers of this heinous bloody deed o calm thee gentle lord although i know there is enough written upon this earth to stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts and arm the minds of infants to exclaims my lord kneel down with me lavinia kneel  and kneel sweet boy the roman hector's hope and swear with me as with the woeful fere and father of that chaste dishonored dame lord junius brutus swore for lucrece' rape  that we will prosecute by good advice mortal revenge upon these traitorous goths and see their blood or die with this reproach ay that's my boy thy father hath full oft for his ungrateful country done the like o heavens can you hear a good man groan and not relent or not compassion him marcus attend him in his ecstasy that hath more scars of sorrow in his heart than foemen's marks upon his battered shield but yet so just that he will not revenge revenge the heavens for old andronicus o publius is not this a heavy case to see thy noble uncle thus distract kinsmen his sorrows are past remedy but join with the goths and with revengeful war take wreak on rome for this ingratitude and vengeance on the traitor saturnine kinsmen shoot all your shafts into the court we will afflict the emperor in his pride my lord i aim a mile beyond the moon your letter is with jupiter by this this was the sport my lord when publius shot the bull being galled gave aries such a knock that down fell both the ram's horns in the court and who should find them but the empress' villain she laughed and told the moor he should not choose but give them to his master for a present why sir that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration and let him deliver the pigeons to the emperor from you this will i do and soon return again rome's emperor and nephew break the parle these quarrels must be quietly debated the feast is ready which the careful titus hath ordained to an honorable end for peace for love for league and good to rome please you therefore draw nigh and take your places you sad faced men people and sons of rome by uproars severed as a flight of fowl scattered by winds and high tempestuous gusts o let me teach you how to knit again this scattered corn into one mutual sheaf these broken limbs again into one body lest rome herself be bane unto herself and she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to like a forlorn and desperate castaway do shameful execution on herself but if my frosty signs and chaps of age grave witnesses of true experience cannot induce you to attend my words speak rome's dear friend as erst our ancestor when with his solemn tongue he did discourse to lovesick dido's sad attending ear the story of that baleful burning night when subtle greeks surprised king priam's troy tell us what sinon hath bewitched our ears or who hath brought the fatal engine in that gives our troy our rome the civil wound  my heart is not compact of flint nor steel nor can i utter all our bitter grief but floods of tears will drown my oratory and break my utterance even in the time when it should move you to attend me most and force you to commiseration here's rome's young captain let him tell the tale while i stand by and weep to hear him speak now is my turn to speak behold the child of this was tamora deliverèd the issue of an irreligious moor chief architect and plotter of these woes the villain is alive in titus' house and as he is to witness this is true now judge what cause had titus to revenge these wrongs unspeakable past patience or more than any living man could bear now have you heard the truth what say you romans have we done aught amiss show us wherein and from the place where you behold us pleading the poor remainder of andronici will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves and on the ragged stones beat forth our souls and make a mutual closure of our house speak romans speak and if you say we shall lo hand in hand lucius and i will fall go go into old titus' sorrowful house and hither hale that misbelieving moor to be adjudged some direful slaught'ring death as punishment for his most wicked life tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss thy brother marcus tenders on thy lips o were the sum of these that i should pay countless and infinite yet would i pay them how many thousand times hath these poor lips when they were living warmed themselves on thine o now sweet boy give them their latest kiss bid him farewell commit him to the grave do them that kindness and take leave of them
