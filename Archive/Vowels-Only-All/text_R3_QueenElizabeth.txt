number of the dead and make me die the thrall of margaret's curse nor mother wife nor england's counted queen go go poor soul i envy not thy glory to feed my humor wish thyself no harm poor heart adieu i pity thy complaining stay yet look back with me unto the tower  pity you ancient stones those tender babes whom envy hath immured within your walls  rough cradle for such little pretty ones rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow for tender princes use my babies well so foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell ah my poor princes ah my tender babes my unblown flowers new appearing sweets if yet your gentle souls fly in the air and be not fixed in doom perpetual hover about me with your airy wings and hear your mother's lamentation wilt thou o god fly from such gentle lambs and throw them in the entrails of the wolf when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done ah that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave as thou canst yield a melancholy seat then would i hide my bones not rest them here ah who hath any cause to mourn but we o thou didst prophesy the time would come that i should wish for thee to help me curse that bottled spider that foul bunch backed toad o thou well skilled in curses stay awhile and teach me how to curse mine enemies my words are dull o quicken them with thine windy attorneys to their clients' woes airy succeeders of intestate joys poor breathing orators of miseries let them have scope though what they will impart help nothing else yet do they ease the heart hid'st thou that forehead with a golden crown where should be branded if that right were right the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown and the dire death of my poor sons and brothers tell me thou villain slave where are my children where is the gentle rivers vaughan grey though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse abides in me i say amen to her i have no more sons of the royal blood for thee to slaughter for my daughters richard they shall be praying nuns not weeping queens and therefore level not to hit their lives and must she die for this o let her live and i'll corrupt her manners stain her beauty slander myself as false to edward's bed throw over her the veil of infamy so she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter i will confess she was not edward's daughter to save her life i'll say she is not so and only in that safety died her brothers no to their lives ill friends were contrary true when avoided grace makes destiny my babes were destined to a fairer death if grace had blessed thee with a fairer life cousins indeed and by their uncle cozened of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life whose hand soever launched their tender hearts thy head all indirectly gave direction no doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt till it was whetted on thy stone hard heart to revel in the entrails of my lambs but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes and i in such a desp'rate bay of death like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom what good is covered with the face of heaven to be discovered that can do me good up to some scaffold there to lose their heads flatter my sorrow with report of it tell me what state what dignity what honor canst thou demise to any child of mine be brief lest that the process of thy kindness last longer telling than thy kindness' date my daughter's mother thinks it with her soul that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul so from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers and from my heart's love i do thank thee for it well then who dost thou mean shall be her king what thou how canst thou woo her and wilt thou learn of me send to her by the man that slew her brothers a pair of bleeding hearts thereon engrave edward and york then haply will she weep therefore present to her as sometime margaret did to thy father steeped in rutland's blood  a handkerchief which say to her did drain the purple sap from her sweet brother's body and bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal if this inducement move her not to love send her a letter of thy noble deeds tell her thou mad'st away her uncle clarence her uncle rivers ay and for her sake mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt anne there is no other way unless thou couldst put on some other shape and not be richard that hath done all this nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee having bought love with such a bloody spoil what were i best to say her father's brother would be her lord or shall i say her uncle or he that slew her brothers and her uncles under what title shall i woo for thee that god the law my honor and her love can make seem pleasing to her tender years which she shall purchase with still lasting war that at her hands which the king's king forbids to vail the title as her mother doth but how long shall that title ever last but how long fairly shall her sweet life last as long as hell and richard likes of it but she your subject loathes such sovereignty an honest tale speeds best being plainly told plain and not honest is too harsh a style o no my reasons are too deep and dead  too deep and dead poor infants in their graves harp on it still shall i till heart strings break profaned dishonored and the third usurped by nothing for this is no oath thy george profaned hath lost his lordly honor thy garter blemished pawned his knightly virtue thy crown usurped disgraced his kingly glory if something thou wouldst swear to be believed swear then by something that thou hast not wronged thyself is self misused 'tis full of thy foul wrongs thy life hath it dishonored god's wrong is most of all if thou didst fear to break an oath with him the unity the king my husband made thou hadst not broken nor my brothers died if thou hadst feared to break an oath by him th' imperial metal circling now thy head had graced the tender temples of my child and both the princes had been breathing here which now two tender bedfellows for dust thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms what canst thou swear by now that thou hast wrongèd in the time o'erpast for i myself have many tears to wash hereafter time for time past wronged by thee the children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered ungoverned youth to wail it in their age the parents live whose children thou hast butchered old barren plants to wail it with their age swear not by time to come for that thou hast misused ere used by times ill used o'erpast shall i be tempted of the devil thus shall i forget myself to be myself yet thou didst kill my children shall i go win my daughter to thy will i go write to me very shortly and you shall understand from me her mind
