cousin you shall be the messenger ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack to see this sight it irks my very soul withhold revenge dear god 'tis not my fault nor wittingly have i infringed my vow full well hath clifford played the orator inferring arguments of mighty force but clifford tell me didst thou never hear that things ill got had ever bad success and happy always was it for that son whose father for his hoarding went to hell i'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind and would my father had left me no more for all the rest is held at such a rate as brings a thousandfold more care to keep than in possession any jot of pleasure ah cousin york would thy best friends did know how it doth grieve me that thy head is here edward plantagenet arise a knight and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right why that's my fortune too therefore i'll stay have done with words my lords and hear me speak i prithee give no limits to my tongue i am a king and privileged to speak this battle fares like to the morning's war when dying clouds contend with growing light what time the shepherd blowing of his nails can neither call it perfect day nor night now sways it this way like a mighty sea forced by the tide to combat with the wind now sways it that way like the selfsame sea forced to retire by fury of the wind sometime the flood prevails and then the wind now one the better then another best both tugging to be victors breast to breast yet neither conqueror nor conquerèd so is the equal poise of this fell war here on this molehill will i sit me down to whom god will there be the victory for margaret my queen and clifford too have chid me from the battle swearing both they prosper best of all when i am thence would i were dead if god's good will were so for what is in this world but grief and woe o god methinks it were a happy life to be no better than a homely swain to sit upon a hill as i do now to carve out dials quaintly point by point thereby to see the minutes how they run how many makes the hour full complete how many hours brings about the day how many days will finish up the year how many years a mortal man may live when this is known then to divide the times so many hours must i tend my flock so many hours must i take my rest so many hours must i contemplate so many hours must i sport myself so many days my ewes have been with young so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean so many years ere i shall shear the fleece so minutes hours days months and years passed over to the end they were created would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade to shepherds looking on their silly sheep than doth a rich embroidered canopy to kings that fear their subjects' treachery o yes it doth a thousandfold it doth and to conclude the shepherd's homely curds his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle his wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade all which secure and sweetly he enjoys is far beyond a prince's delicates  his viands sparkling in a golden cup his body couchèd in a curious bed  when care mistrust and treason waits on him o piteous spectacle o bloody times whiles lions war and battle for their dens poor harmless lambs abide their enmity weep wretched man i'll aid thee tear for tear and let our hearts and eyes like civil war be blind with tears and break o'ercharged with grief woe above woe grief more than common grief o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds o pity pity gentle heaven pity the red rose and the white are on his face the fatal colors of our striving houses the one his purple blood right well resembles the other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth wither one rose and let the other flourish if you contend a thousand lives must wither how will the country for these woeful chances misthink the king and not be satisfied was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe much is your sorrow mine ten times so much sad hearted men much overgone with care here sits a king more woeful than you are nay take me with thee good sweet exeter not that i fear to stay but love to go whither the queen intends forward away from scotland am i stol'n even of pure love to greet mine own land with my wishful sight no harry harry 'tis no land of thine thy place is filled thy scepter wrung from thee thy balm washed off wherewith thou wast anointed no bending knee will call thee caesar now no humble suitors press to speak for right no not a man comes for redress of thee for how can i help them an not myself let me embrace the sour adversaries for wise men say it is the wisest course my queen and son are gone to france for aid and as i hear the great commanding warwick is thither gone to crave the french king's sister to wife for edward if this news be true poor queen and son your labor is but lost for warwick is a subtle orator and lewis a prince soon won with moving words by this account then margaret may win him for she's a woman to be pitied much her sighs will make a batt'ry in his breast her tears will pierce into a marble heart the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn and nero will be tainted with remorse to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears ay but she's come to beg warwick to give she on his left side craving aid for henry he on his right asking a wife for edward she weeps and says her henry is deposed he smiles and says his edward is installed that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong inferreth arguments of mighty strength and in conclusion wins the king from her with promise of his sister and what else to strengthen and support king edward's place o margaret thus 'twill be and thou poor soul art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn more than i seem and less than i was born to a man at least for less i should not be and men may talk of kings and why not i why so i am in mind and that's enough my crown is in my heart not on my head not decked with diamonds and indian stones nor to be seen my crown is called content a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy but did you never swear and break an oath where did you dwell when i was king of england i was anointed king at nine months old my father and my grandfather were kings and you were sworn true subjects unto me and tell me then have you not broke your oaths why am i dead do i not breathe a man ah simple men you know not what you swear look as i blow this feather from my face and as the air blows it to me again obeying with my wind when i do blow and yielding to another when it blows commanded always by the greater gust such is the lightness of you common men but do not break your oaths for of that sin my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty go where you will the king shall be commanded and be you kings command and i'll obey so would you be again to henry if he were seated as king edward is in god's name lead your king's name be obeyed and what god will that let your king perform and what he will i humbly yield unto master lieutenant now that god and friends have shaken edward from the regal seat and turned my captive state to liberty my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys at our enlargement what are thy due fees for what lieutenant for well using me nay be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure ay such a pleasure as encagèd birds conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty  but warwick after god thou sett'st me free and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee he was the author thou the instrument therefore that i may conquer fortune's spite by living low where fortune cannot hurt me and that the people of this blessèd land may not be punished with my thwarting stars warwick although my head still wear the crown i here resign my government to thee for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds warwick and clarence give me both your hands now join your hands and with your hands your hearts that no dissension hinder government i make you both protectors of this land while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion spend my latter days to sin's rebuke and my creator's praise but with the first of all your chief affairs let me entreat for i command no more  that margaret your queen and my son edward be sent for to return from france with speed for till i see them here by doubtful fear my joy of liberty is half eclipsed my lord of somerset what youth is that of whom you seem to have so tender care come hither england's hope if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts this pretty lad will prove our country's bliss his looks are full of peaceful majesty his head by nature framed to wear a crown his hand to wield a scepter and himself likely in time to bless a regal throne make much of him my lords for this is he must help you more than you are hurt by me let's levy men and beat him back again farewell my hector and my troy's true hope well minded clarence be thou fortunate sweet oxford and my loving montague and all at once once more a happy farewell here at the palace will i rest awhile cousin of exeter what thinks your lordship methinks the power that edward hath in field should not be able to encounter mine that's not my fear my meed hath got me fame i have not stopped mine ears to their demands nor posted off their suits with slow delays my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds my mildness hath allayed their swelling griefs my mercy dried their water flowing tears i have not been desirous of their wealth nor much oppressed them with great subsidies nor forward of revenge though they much erred then why should they love edward more than me no exeter these graces challenge grace and when the lion fawns upon the lamb the lamb will never cease to follow him ay my good lord my lord i should say rather 'tis sin to flatter good was little better good gloucester and good devil were alike and both preposterous therefore not good lord so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece and next his throat unto the butcher's knife what scene of death hath roscius now to act the bird that hath been limèd in a bush with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush and i the hapless male to one sweet bird have now the fatal object in my eye where my poor young was limed was caught and killed i daedalus my poor boy icarus thy father minos that denied our course the sun that seared the wings of my sweet boy thy brother edward and thyself the sea whose envious gulf did swallow up his life ah kill me with thy weapon not with words my breast can better brook thy dagger's point than can my ears that tragic history but wherefore dost thou come is 't for my life a persecutor i am sure thou art if murdering innocents be executing why then thou art an executioner hadst thou been killed when first thou didst presume thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine and thus i prophesy that many a thousand which now mistrust no parcel of my fear and many an old man's sigh and many a widow's and many an orphan's water standing eye men for their sons wives for their husbands orphans for their parents' timeless death shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born the owl shrieked at thy birth an evil sign the night crow cried aboding luckless time dogs howled and hideous tempest shook down trees the raven rooked her on the chimney's top and chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung thy mother felt more than a mother's pain and yet brought forth less than a mother's hope to wit an indigested and deformèd lump not like the fruit of such a goodly tree teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born to signify thou cam'st to bite the world and if the rest be true which i have heard thou cam'st  ay and for much more slaughter after this o god forgive my sins and pardon thee
