ruffle thus what will you do i have a letter guessingly set down which came from one that's of a neutral heart and not from one opposed to dover i am tied to th' stake and i must stand the course

endured would have buoyed up and quenched the stellèd fires yet poor old heart he holp the heavens to rain if wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time thou shouldst have said good porter turn the key all cruels else subscribe but i shall see the wingèd vengeance overtake such children he that will think to live till he be old give me some help o cruel o you gods all dark and comfortless

begone thy comforts can do me no good at all thee they may hurt i have no way and therefore want no eyes i stumbled when i saw full oft 'tis seen our means secure us and our mere defects prove our commodities o dear son edgar the food of thy abusèd father's wrath might i but live to see thee in my touch i'd say i had eyes again is it a beggar man he has some reason else he could not beg i' th' last night's storm i such a fellow saw which made me think a man a worm my son came then into my mind and yet my mind was then scarce friends with him i have heard more since as flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods they kill us for their sport is that the naked fellow then prithee get thee away if for my sake thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain i' th' way toward dover do it for ancient love and bring some covering for this naked soul which i'll entreat to lead me 'tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind do as i bid thee or rather do thy pleasure above the rest begone sirrah naked fellow  come hither fellow know'st thou the way to dover here take this purse thou whom the heavens' plagues have humbled to all strokes that i am wretched makes thee the happier heavens deal so

dost thou know dover there is a cliff whose high and bending head looks fearfully in the confinèd deep bring me but to the very brim of it and i'll repair the misery thou dost bear with something rich about me from that place i shall no leading need when shall i come to th' top of that same hill methinks the ground is even no truly so may it be indeed methinks thy voice is altered and thou speak'st in better phrase and matter than thou didst methinks you're better spoken set me where you stand let go my hand here friend 's another purse in it a jewel well worth a poor man's taking fairies and gods prosper it with thee go thou further off bid me farewell and let me hear thee going with all my heart o you mighty gods this world i do renounce and in your sights shake patiently my great affliction off if i could bear it longer and not fall to quarrel with your great opposeless wills my snuff and loathèd part of nature should burn itself out if edgar live o bless him  now fellow fare thee well away and let me die but have i fall'n or no alack i have no eyes is wretchedness deprived that benefit to end itself by death 'twas yet some comfort when misery could beguile the tyrant's rage and frustrate his proud will too well too well a poor unfortunate beggar i do remember now henceforth i'll bear affliction till it do cry out itself enough enough and die that thing you speak of i took it for a man often 'twould say the fiend the fiend he led me to that place i know that voice the trick of that voice i do well remember is 't not the king o let me kiss that hand o ruined piece of nature this great world shall so wear out to naught dost thou know me were all thy letters suns i could not see what with the case of eyes i see it feelingly ay sir alack alack the day you ever gentle gods take my breath from me let not my worser spirit tempt me again to die before you please now good sir what are you hearty thanks the bounty and the benison of heaven to boot and boot now let thy friendly hand put strength enough to 't what is he dead the king is mad how stiff is my vile sense that i stand up and have ingenious feeling of my huge sorrows better i were distract so should my thoughts be severed from my griefs and woes by wrong imaginations lose the knowledge of themselves grace go with you sir no further sir a man may rot even here and that's true too
