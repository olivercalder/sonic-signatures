as i remember adam it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns and as thou sayst charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there begins my sadness my brother jaques he keeps at school and report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox his horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired but i his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as i besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me he lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education this is it adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which i think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude i will no longer endure it though yet i know no wise remedy how to avoid it go apart adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up nothing i am not taught to make anything marry sir i am helping you to mar that which god made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness shall i keep your hogs and eat husks with them what prodigal portion have i spent that i should come to such penury o sir very well here in your orchard ay better than him i am before knows me i know you are my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me the courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the first born but the same tradition takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers betwixt us i have as much of my father in me as you albeit i confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence come come elder brother you are too young in this i am no villain i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys he was my father and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains wert thou not my brother i would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself i will not till i please you shall hear me my father charged you in his will to give me good education you have trained me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities the spirit of my father grows strong in me and i will no longer endure it therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament with that i will go buy my fortunes i will no further offend you than becomes me for my good i attend them with all respect and duty no fair princess he is the general challenger i come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth i beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein i confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if i be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious if killed but one dead that is willing to be so i shall do my friends no wrong for i have none to lament me the world no injury for in it i have nothing only in the world i fill up a place which may be better supplied when i have made it empty ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working you mean to mock me after you should not have mocked me before but come your ways yes i beseech your grace i am not yet well breathed orlando my liege the youngest son of sir rowland de boys i am more proud to be sir rowland's son his youngest son and would not change that calling to be adopted heir to frederick can i not say i thank you my better parts are all thrown down and that which here stands up is but a quintain a mere lifeless block what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue i cannot speak to her yet she urged conference o poor orlando thou art overthrown or charles or something weaker masters thee i thank you sir and pray you tell me this which of the two was daughter of the duke that here was at the wrestling i rest much bounden to you fare you well thus must i from the smoke into the smother from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother but heavenly rosalind who's there why what's the matter why whither adam wouldst thou have me go what wouldst thou have me go and beg my food or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road this i must do or know not what to do yet this i will not do do how i can i rather will subject me to the malice of a diverted blood and bloody brother o good old man how well in thee appears the constant service of the antique world when service sweat for duty not for meed thou art not for the fashion of these times where none will sweat but for promotion and having that do choke their service up even with the having it is not so with thee but poor old man thou prun'st a rotten tree that cannot so much as a blossom yield in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry but come thy ways we'll go along together and ere we have thy youthful wages spent we'll light upon some settled low content why how now adam no greater heart in thee live a little comfort a little cheer thyself a little if this uncouth forest yield anything savage i will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers for my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at the arm's end i will here be with thee presently and if i bring thee not something to eat i will give thee leave to die but if thou diest before i come thou art a mocker of my labor well said thou look'st cheerly and i'll be with thee quickly yet thou liest in the bleak air come i will bear thee to some shelter and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live anything in this desert cheerly good adam forbear and eat no more nor shalt not till necessity be served you touched my vein at first the thorny point of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show of smooth civility yet am i inland bred and know some nurture but forbear i say he dies that touches any of this fruit till i and my affairs are answerèd i almost die for food and let me have it speak you so gently pardon me i pray you i thought that all things had been savage here and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment but whate'er you are that in this desert inaccessible under the shade of melancholy boughs lose and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have looked on better days if ever been where bells have knolled to church if ever sat at any good man's feast if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear and know what 'tis to pity and be pitied let gentleness my strong enforcement be in the which hope i blush and hide my sword then but forbear your food a little while whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn and give it food there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limped in pure love till he be first sufficed oppressed with two weak evils age and hunger i will not touch a bit i thank you and be blessed for your good comfort i thank you most for him hang there my verse in witness of my love and thou thrice crownèd queen of night survey with thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway o rosalind these trees shall be my books and in their barks my thoughts i'll character that every eye which in this forest looks shall see thy virtue witnessed everywhere run run orlando carve on every tree the fair the chaste and unexpressive she and so had i but yet for fashion sake i thank you too for your society i do desire we may be better strangers i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill favoredly yes just there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened just as high as my heart not

very well what would you you should ask me what time o' day there's no clock in the forest and why not the swift foot of time had not that been as proper i prithee who doth he trot withal who ambles time withal who doth he gallop withal who stays it still withal where dwell you pretty youth are you native of this place your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women i prithee recount some of them i am he that is so love shaked i pray you tell me your remedy what were his marks fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love i swear to thee youth by the white hand of rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he neither rhyme nor reason can express how much did you

hour of my promise pardon me dear rosalind of a snail what's that virtue is no hornmaker and my rosalind is virtuous i would kiss before i spoke how if the kiss be denied who could be out being before

consent let your wedding be tomorrow thither will i invite the duke and all 's contented followers go you and prepare aliena for look you here comes my rosalind it is my arm wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady ay and greater wonders than that they shall be married tomorrow and i will bid the duke to the nuptial but o how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes by so much the more shall i tomorrow be at the height of heart heaviness by how much i shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for i can live no longer by thinking speak'st thou in sober meanings and i for rosalind and i for rosalind and so am i for rosalind if this be so why blame you me to love you to her that is not here nor doth not hear nor i i sometimes do believe and sometimes do not as those that fear they hope and know they fear that would i were i of all kingdoms king my lord the first time that i ever saw him methought he was a brother to your daughter but my good lord this boy is forest born and hath been tutored in the rudiments of many desperate studies by his uncle whom he reports to be a great magician obscurèd in the circle of this forest if there be truth in sight you are my rosalind
