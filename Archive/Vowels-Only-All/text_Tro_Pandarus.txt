chin  why he is very young and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother hector but to prove to you that helen loves him she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin  why you know 'tis dimpled i think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all phrygia does he not why go to then but to prove to you that helen loves troilus  troilus why he esteems her no more than i esteem an addle egg i cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin indeed she has a marvellous white hand i must needs confess  and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin but there was such laughing queen hecuba laughed that her eyes ran o'er  and cassandra laughed  and hector laughed marry at the white hair that helen spied on troilus' chin they laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer quoth she here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin and one of them is white that's true make no question of that two and fifty hairs quoth he and one white that white hair is my father and all the rest are his sons jupiter quoth she which of these hairs is paris my husband the forked one quoth he pluck 't out and give it him but there was such laughing
