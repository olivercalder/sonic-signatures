by my troth sir toby you must come in earlier o' nights your cousin my lady takes great exceptions to your ill hours ay but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order that quaffing and drinking will undo you i heard my lady talk of it yesterday and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer ay he what's that to th' purpose ay but he'll have but a year in all these ducats he's a very fool and a prodigal he hath indeed almost natural for besides that he's a fool he's a great quarreler and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarreling 'tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave they that add moreover he's drunk nightly in your company and you too sir my name is mary sir fare you well gentlemen sir i have not you by th' hand now sir thought is free i pray you bring your hand to th' butt'ry bar and let it drink it's dry sir a dry jest sir ay sir i have them at my fingers' ends marry now i let go your hand i am barren nay either tell me where thou hast been or i will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse my lady will hang thee for thy absence make that good a good lenten answer i can tell thee where that saying was born of i fear no colors in the wars and that may you be bold to say in your foolery yet you will be hanged for being so long absent or to be turned away is not that as good as a hanging to you you are resolute then that if one break the other will hold or if both break your gaskins fall peace you rogue no more o' that here comes my lady make your excuse wisely you were best madam there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you i know not madam 'tis a fair young man and well attended sir toby madam your kinsman will you hoist sail sir here lies your way what a caterwauling do you keep here if my lady have not called up her steward malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors never trust me for the love o' god peace nay good sir toby go shake your ears sweet sir toby be patient for tonight since the youth of the count's was today with my lady she is much out of quiet for monsieur malvolio let me alone with him if i do not gull him into a nayword and make him a common recreation do not think i have wit enough to lie straight in my bed i know i can do it marry sir sometimes he is a kind of puritan the devil a puritan that he is or anything constantly but a time pleaser an affectioned ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swaths the best persuaded of himself so crammed as he thinks with excellencies that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work i will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love wherein by the color of his beard the shape of his leg the manner of his gait the expressure of his eye forehead and complexion he shall find himself most feelingly personated i can write very like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands my purpose is indeed a horse of that color ass i doubt not sport royal i warrant you i know my physic will work with him i will plant you two and let the fool make a third where he shall find the letter observe his construction of it for this night to bed and dream on the event farewell get you all three into the boxtree malvolio's coming down this walk he has been yonder i' the sun practicing behavior to his own shadow this half hour observe him for the love of mockery for i know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him close in the name of jesting lie thou there for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling nay but say true does it work upon him if you will then see the fruits of the sport mark his first approach before my lady he will come to her in yellow stockings and 'tis a color she abhors and cross gartered a fashion she detests and he will smile upon her which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt if you will see it follow me if you desire the spleen and will laugh yourselves into stitches follow me yond gull malvolio is turned heathen a very renegado for there is no christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness he's in yellow stockings most villainously like a pedant that keeps a school i' th' church i have dogged him like his murderer he does obey every point of the letter that i dropped to betray him he does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the indies you have not seen such a thing as 'tis i can hardly forbear hurling things at him i know my lady will strike him if she do he'll smile and take 't for a great favor he's coming madam but in very strange manner he is sure possessed madam no madam he does nothing but smile your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come for sure the man is tainted in 's wits how do you malvolio why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady lo how hollow the fiend speaks within him did not i tell you sir toby my lady prays you to have a care of him la you an you speak ill of the devil how he takes it at heart pray god he be not bewitched marry and it shall be done tomorrow morning if i live my lady would not lose him for more than i'll say o lord get him to say his prayers good sir toby get him to pray no i warrant you he will not hear of godliness nay pursue him now lest the device take air and taint the house will be the quieter you may have very fit occasion for 't he is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart nay i prithee put on this gown and this beard make him believe thou art sir topas the curate do it quickly i'll call sir toby the whilst thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown he sees thee not
