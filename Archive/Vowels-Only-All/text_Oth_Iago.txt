'sblood but you'll not hear me if ever i did dream of such a matter abhor me despise me if i do not three great ones of the city in personal suit to make me his lieutenant off capped to him and by the faith of man i know my price i am worth no worse a place but he as loving his own pride and purposes evades them with a bombast circumstance horribly stuffed with epithets of war and in conclusion nonsuits my mediators for certes says he i have already chose my officer and what was he forsooth a great arithmetician one michael cassio a florentine a fellow almost damned in a fair wife that never set a squadron in the field nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric wherein the togèd consuls can propose as masterly as he mere prattle without practice is all his soldiership but he sir had th' election and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds christened and heathen must be beleed and calmed by debitor and creditor this countercaster he in good time must his lieutenant be and i god bless the mark his moorship's ancient why there's no remedy 'tis the curse of service preferment goes by letter and affection and not by old gradation where each second stood heir to th' first now sir be judge yourself whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor o sir content you i follow him to serve my turn upon him we cannot all be masters nor all masters cannot be truly followed you shall mark many a duteous and knee crooking knave that doting on his own obsequious bondage wears out his time much like his master's ass for naught but provender and when he's old cashiered whip me such honest knaves others there are who trimmed in forms and visages of duty keep yet their hearts attending on themselves and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats do themselves homage these fellows have some soul and such a one do i profess myself for sir it is as sure as you are roderigo were i the moor i would not be iago in following him i follow but myself heaven is my judge not i for love and duty but seeming so for my peculiar end for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in complement extern 'tis not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at i am not what i am call up her father rouse him make after him poison his delight proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen and though he in a fertile climate dwell plague him with flies though that his joy be joy yet throw such chances of vexation on 't as it may lose some color do with like timorous accent and dire yell as when by night and negligence the fire is spied in populous cities awake what ho brabantio thieves thieves look to your house your daughter and your bags thieves thieves are your doors locked zounds sir you're robbed for shame put on your gown your heart is burst you have lost half your soul even now now very now an old black ram is tupping your white ewe arise arise awake the snorting citizens with the bell or else the devil will make a grandsire of you arise i say zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve god if the devil bid you because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians you'll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse you'll have your nephews neigh to you you'll have coursers for cousins and jennets for germans i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs you are a senator farewell for i must leave you it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place to be producted as if i stay i shall against the moor for i do know the state however this may gall him with some check cannot with safety cast him for he's embarked with such loud reason to the cyprus wars which even now stands in act that for their souls another of his fathom they have none to lead their business in which regard though i do hate him as i do hell pains yet for necessity of present life i must show out a flag and sign of love  which is indeed but sign that you shall surely find him lead to the sagittary the raisèd search and there will i be with him so farewell though in the trade of war i have slain men yet do i hold it very stuff o' th' conscience to do no contrived murder i lack iniquity sometimes to do me service nine or ten times i had thought t' have yerked him here under the ribs nay but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honor that with the little godliness i have i did full hard forbear him but i pray you sir are you fast married be assured of this that the magnifico is much beloved and hath in his effect a voice potential as double as the duke's he will divorce you or put upon you what restraint or grievance the law with all his might to enforce it on will give him cable those are the raisèd father and his friends you were best go in by janus i think no faith he tonight hath boarded a land carrack if it prove lawful prize he's made forever he's married marry to come captain will you go it is brabantio general be advised he comes to bad intent you roderigo come sir i am for you what sayst thou noble heart why go to bed and sleep if thou dost i shall never love thee after why thou silly gentleman o villainous i have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i would change my humanity with a baboon virtue a fig 'tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts  whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favor with an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy purse  nor he his to her it was a violent commencement in her and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse these moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her thou art sure of me go make money i have told thee often and i retell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this tomorrow adieu at my lodging go to farewell do you hear roderigo no more of drowning do you hear go to farewell put money enough in your purse thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gained knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets 'has done my office i know not if 't be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety he holds me well the better shall my purpose work on him cassio's a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery how how let's see after some time to abuse othello's ear that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected framed to make women false the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so and will as tenderly be led by th' nose as asses are i have 't it is engendered hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light sir would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me you would have enough in faith too much i find it still when i have list to sleep marry before your ladyship i grant she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking come on come on you are pictures out of door bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens saints in your injuries devils being offended players in your huswifery and huswives in your beds nay it is true or else i am a turk you rise to play and go to bed to work no let me not o gentle lady do not put me to 't for i am nothing if not critical ay madam i am about it but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze it plucks out brains and all but my muse labors and thus she is delivered if she be fair and wise fairness and wit the one's for use the other useth it if she be black and thereto have a wit she'll find a white that shall her blackness hit she never yet was foolish that was fair for even her folly helped her to an heir there's none so foul and foolish thereunto but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do she that was ever fair and never proud had tongue at will and yet was never loud never lacked gold and yet went never gay fled from her wish and yet said now i may she that being angered her revenge being nigh bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod's head for the salmon's tail she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind see suitors following and not look behind she was a wight if ever such wight were  to suckle fools and chronicle small beer he takes her by the palm ay well said whisper with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship you say true 'tis so indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in very good well kissed an excellent courtesy 'tis so indeed yet again your fingers to your lips would they were clyster pipes for your sake the moor i know his trumpet o you are well tuned now but i'll set down the pegs that make this music as honest as i am do thou meet me presently at the harbor come hither if thou be'st valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first i must tell thee this desdemona is directly in love with him lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed mark me with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favor sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already blessed fig's end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark that lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together villainous thoughts roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise th' incorporate conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me i have brought you from venice watch you tonight for the command i'll lay 't upon you cassio knows you not i'll not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favorably minister sir he's rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell that cassio loves her i do well believe 't that she loves him 'tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think he'll prove to desdemona a most dear husband now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leaped into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am evened with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment cannot cure which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trace for his quick hunting stand the putting on i'll have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my nightcap too make the moor thank me love me and reward me for making him egregiously an ass and practicing upon his peace and quiet even to madness 'tis here but yet confused knavery's plain face is never seen till used not this hour lieutenant 'tis not yet ten o' th' clock our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for jove and i'll warrant her full of game what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley to provocation and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love well happiness to their sheets come lieutenant i have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello o they are our friends but one cup i'll drink for you what man 'tis a night of revels the gallants desire it here at the door i pray you call them in if i can fasten but one cup upon him with that which he hath drunk tonight already he'll be as full of quarrel and offense as my young mistress' dog now my sick fool roderigo whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out to desdemona hath tonight caroused potations pottle deep and he's to watch three else of cyprus noble swelling spirits that hold their honors in a wary distance the very elements of this warlike isle have i tonight flustered with flowing cups and they watch too now 'mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the isle but here they come if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely both with wind and stream some wine ho and let me the cannikin clink clink and let me the cannikin clink a soldier's a man o man's life's but a span why then let a soldier drink some wine boys i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting your dane your german and your swag bellied hollander drink ho are nothing to your english why he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled o sweet england king stephen was and a worthy peer his breeches cost him but a crown he held them sixpence all too dear with that he called the tailor lown he was a wight of high renown and thou art but of low degree 'tis pride that pulls the country down then take thy auld cloak about thee some wine ho will you hear 't again it's true good lieutenant and so do i too lieutenant you see this fellow that is gone before he's a soldier fit to stand by caesar and give direction and do but see his vice 'tis to his virtue a just equinox the one as long as th' other 'tis pity of him i fear the trust othello puts him in on some odd time of his infirmity will shake this island 'tis evermore the prologue to his sleep he'll watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle how now roderigo i pray you after the lieutenant go not i for this fair island i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evil but hark what noise away i say go out and cry a mutiny nay good lieutenant god's will gentlemen  help ho lieutenant sir montano sir  help masters here's a goodly watch indeed who's that which rings the bell diablo ho the town will rise god's will lieutenant hold you will be shamed forever hold ho lieutenant sir montano gentlemen  have you forgot all sense of place and duty hold the general speaks to you hold for shame i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom divesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and tilting one at other's breast in opposition bloody i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offense to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamor as it so fell out  the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i returned the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till tonight i ne'er might say before when i came back  for this was brief i found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass what are you hurt lieutenant marry god forbid as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and he's yours what was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to you is 't possible why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not so befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you you or any man living may be drunk at a time man i'll tell you what you shall do our general's wife is now the general i may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch and what's he then that says i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for 'tis most easy th' inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit she's framed as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moor were 't to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeemèd sin  his soul is so enfettered to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortune and she for him pleads strongly to the moor i'll pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her body's lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all how now roderigo how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time does 't not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashiered cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by th' mass 'tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short retire thee go where thou art billeted away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress i'll set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay that's the way dull not device by coldness and delay you have not been abed then i'll send her to you presently and i'll devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way that your converse and business may be more free well my good lord i'll do 't ha i like not that nothing my lord or if i know not what cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it that he would steal away so guiltylike seeing your coming my noble lord  did michael cassio when you wooed my lady know of your love but for a satisfaction of my thought no further harm i did not think he had been acquainted with her indeed honest my lord my lord for aught i know think my lord my lord you know i love you for michael cassio i dare be sworn i think that he is honest men should be what they seem or those that be not would they might seem none why then i think cassio's an honest man good my lord pardon me though i am bound to every act of duty i am not bound to that all slaves are free to utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false  as where's that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not who has that breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and law days and in sessions sit with meditations lawful i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guess  as i confess it is my nature's plague to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy shapes faults that are not that your wisdom from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty and wisdom to let you know my thoughts good name in man and woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash 'tis something nothing 'twas mine 'tis his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed you cannot if my heart were in your hand nor shall not whilst 'tis in my custody o beware my lord of jealousy it is the green eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger but o what damnèd minutes tells he o'er who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves poor and content is rich and rich enough but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor good god the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy i am glad of this for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore as i am bound receive it from me i speak not yet of proof look to your wife observe her well with cassio wear your eyes thus not jealous nor secure i would not have your free and noble nature out of self bounty be abused look to 't i know our country disposition well in venice they do let god see the pranks they dare not show their husbands their best conscience is not to leave 't undone but keep 't unknown she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seemed to shake and fear your looks she loved them most why go to then she that so young could give out such a seeming to seel her father's eyes up close as oak he thought 'twas witchcraft but i am much to blame i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you i see this hath a little dashed your spirits i' faith i fear it has i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love but i do see you're moved i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion should you do so my lord my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aim not at cassio's my worthy friend my lord i see you're moved long live she so and long live you to think so ay there's the point as to be bold with you not to affect many proposèd matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends  foh one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproportion thoughts unnatural  but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her though i may fear her will recoiling to her better judgment may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent my lord i take my leave my lord i would i might entreat your honor to scan this thing no farther leave it to time although 'tis fit that cassio have his place  for sure he fills it up with great ability  yet if you please to hold him off awhile you shall by that perceive him and his means note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity much will be seen in that in the meantime let me be thought too busy in my fears  as worthy cause i have to fear i am  and hold her free i do beseech your honor i once more take my leave how now what do you here alone you have a thing for me it is a common thing  to have a foolish wife what handkerchief hast stol'n it from her a good wench give it me why what is that to you be not acknown on 't i have use for it go leave me i will in cassio's lodging lose this napkin and let him find it trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ this may do something the moor already changes with my poison dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons which at the first are scarce found to distaste but with a little act upon the blood burn like the mines of sulfur i did say so look where he comes not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday why how now general no more of that how now my lord i am sorry to hear this is 't possible my lord is 't come to this my noble lord  o grace o heaven forgive me are you a man have you a soul or sense god b' wi' you take mine office o wretched fool that liv'st to make thine honesty a vice  o monstrous world take note take note o world to be direct and honest is not safe  i thank you for this profit and from hence i'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense i should be wise for honesty's a fool and loses that it works for i see you are eaten up with passion i do repent me that i put it to you you would be satisfied and may but how how satisfied my lord would you the supervisor grossly gape on behold her topped it were a tedious difficulty i think to bring them to that prospect damn them then if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own what then how then what shall i say where's satisfaction it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk but yet i say if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction you might have 't i do not like the office but sith i am entered in this cause so far pricked to 't by foolish honesty and love i will go on i lay with cassio lately and being troubled with a raging tooth i could not sleep there are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs one of this kind is cassio in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona let us be wary let us hide our loves and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand cry o sweet creature then kiss me hard as if he plucked up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips then laid his leg o'er my thigh and sighed and kissed and then cried cursèd fate that gave thee to the moor nay this was but his dream and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly nay but be wise yet we see nothing done she may be honest yet tell me but this have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand i know not that but such a handkerchief  i am sure it was your wife's did i today see cassio wipe his beard with if it be that or any that was hers it speaks against her with the other proofs yet be content patience i say your mind perhaps may change do not rise yet witness you ever burning lights above you elements that clip us round about witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit hands heart to wronged othello's service let him command and to obey shall be in me remorse what bloody business ever my friend is dead 'tis done at your request but let her live i am your own forever there is no other way 'tis she must do 't and lo the happiness go and importune her is my lord angry can he be angry i have seen the cannon when it hath blown his ranks into the air and like the devil from his very arm puffed his own brother and is he angry something of moment then i will go meet him there's matter in 't indeed if he be angry will you think so what to kiss in private or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more not meaning any harm if they do nothing 'tis a venial slip but if i give my wife a handkerchief  why then 'tis hers my lord and being hers she may i think bestow 't on any man her honor is an essence that's not seen they have it very oft that have it not but for the handkerchief  ay what of that what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong or heard him say as knaves be such abroad who having by their own importunate suit or voluntary dotage of some mistress convincèd or supplied them cannot choose but they must blab  he hath my lord but be you well assured no more than he'll unswear faith that he did i know not what he did lie  with her on her what you will work on my medicine work thus credulous fools are caught and many worthy and chaste dames even thus all guiltless meet reproach what ho my lord my lord i say othello how now cassio my lord is fall'n into an epilepsy this is his second fit he had one yesterday no forbear the lethargy must have his quiet course if not he foams at mouth and by and by breaks out to savage madness look he stirs do you withdraw yourself a little while he will recover straight when he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you how is it general have you not hurt your head i mock you not by heaven would you would bear your fortune like a man there's many a beast then in a populous city and many a civil monster good sir be a man think every bearded fellow that's but yoked may draw with you there's millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds which they dare swear peculiar your case is better o 'tis the spite of hell the fiend's arch mock to lip a wanton in a secure couch and to suppose her chaste no let me know and knowing what i am i know what she shall be stand you awhile apart confine yourself but in a patient list whilst you were here o'erwhelmèd with your grief  a passion most unsuiting such a man  cassio came hither i shifted him away and laid good 'scuses upon your ecstasy bade him anon return and here speak with me the which he promised do but encave yourself and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns that dwell in every region of his face for i will make him tell the tale anew  where how how oft how long ago and when he hath and is again to cope your wife i say but mark his gesture marry patience or i shall say you're all in all in spleen and nothing of a man that's not amiss but yet keep time in all will you withdraw now will i question cassio of bianca a huswife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature that dotes on cassio as 'tis the strumpet's plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one he when he hears of her cannot restrain from the excess of laughter here he comes as he shall smile othello shall go mad and his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassio's smiles gestures and light behaviors quite in the wrong how do you lieutenant ply desdemona well and you are sure on 't
