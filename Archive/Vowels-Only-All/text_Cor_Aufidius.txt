is it not yours whatever have been thought on in this state that could be brought to bodily act ere rome had circumvention 'tis not four days gone since i heard thence these are the words i think i have the letter here yes here it is they have pressed a power but it is not known whether for east or west the dearth is great the people mutinous and it is rumored cominius martius your old enemy who is of rome worse hated than of you and titus lartius a most valiant roman these three lead on this preparation whither 'tis bent most likely 'tis for you consider of it nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretenses veiled till when they needs must show themselves which in the hatching it seemed appeared to rome by the discovery we shall be shortened in our aim which was to take in many towns ere almost rome should know we were afoot o doubt not that i speak from certainties nay more some parcels of their power are forth already and only hitherward i leave your honors if we and caius martius chance to meet 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more and keep your honors safe we hate alike not afric owns a serpent i abhor more than thy fame and envy fix thy foot if i fly martius hollo me like a hare wert thou the hector that was the whip of your bragged progeny thou shouldst not scape me here officious and not valiant you have shamed me in your condemnèd seconds the town is ta'en condition i would i were a roman for i cannot being a volsce be that i am condition what good condition can a treaty find i' th' part that is at mercy five times martius i have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me and wouldst do so i think should we encounter as often as we eat by th' elements if e'er again i meet him beard to beard he's mine or i am his mine emulation hath not that honor in 't it had for where i thought to crush him in an equal force true sword to sword i'll potch at him some way or wrath or craft may get him bolder though not so subtle my valor's poisoned with only suff'ring stain by him for him shall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuary being naked sick nor fane nor capitol the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice embarquements all of fury shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst my hate to martius where i find him were it at home upon my brother's guard even there against the hospitable canon would i wash my fierce hand in 's heart go you to th' city learn how 'tis held and what they are that must be hostages for rome i am attended at the cypress grove i pray you  'tis south the city mills bring me word thither how the world goes that to the pace of it i may spur on my journey where is this fellow whence com'st thou what wouldst thou thy name why speak'st not speak man what's thy name what is thy name say what's thy name thou hast a grim appearance and thy face bears a command in 't though thy tackle's torn thou show'st a noble vessel what's thy name i know thee not thy name o martius martius each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things and say 'tis true i'd not believe them more than thee all noble martius let me twine mine arms about that body whereagainst my grainèd ash an hundred times hath broke and scarred the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my sword and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valor know thou first i loved the maid i married never man sighed truer breath but that i see thee here thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee we have a power on foot and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn or lose mine arm for 't thou hast beat me out twelve several times and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me we have been down together in my sleep unbuckling helms fisting each other's throat and waked half dead with nothing worthy martius had we no other quarrel else to rome but that thou art thence banished we would muster all from twelve to seventy and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome like a bold flood o'erbear 't o come go in and take our friendly senators by th' hands who now are here taking their leaves of me who am prepared against your territories though not for rome itself therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges take th' one half of my commission and set down  as best thou art experienced since thou know'st thy country's strength and weakness thine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them ere destroy but come in let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes and more a friend than ere an enemy  yet martius that was much your hand most welcome do they still fly to th' roman i cannot help it now unless by using means i lame the foot of our design he bears himself more proudlier even to my person than i thought he would when first i did embrace him yet his nature in that's no changeling and i must excuse what cannot be amended i understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not what i can urge against him although it seems and so he thinks and is no less apparent to th' vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon as draw his sword yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine whene'er we come to our account all places yields to him ere he sits down and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too the tribunes are no soldiers and their people will be as rash in the repeal as hasty to expel him thence i think he'll be to rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes it by sovereignty of nature first he was a noble servant to them but he could not carry his honors even whether 'twas pride which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man whether defect of judgment to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of or whether nature not to be other than one thing not moving from th' casque to th' cushion but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controlled the war but one of these  as he hath spices of them all not all for i dare so far free him made him feared so hated and so banished but he has a merit to choke it in the utt'rance so our virtues lie in th' interpretation of the time and power unto itself most commendable hath not a tomb so evident as a chair t' extol what it hath done one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail come let's away when caius rome is thine thou art poor'st of all then shortly art thou mine you keep a constant temper only their ends you have respected stopped your ears against the general suit of rome never admitted a private whisper no not with such friends that thought them sure of you i was moved withal i am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honor at difference in thee out of that i'll work myself a former fortune go tell the lords o' th' city i am here deliver them this paper having read it bid them repair to th' marketplace where i even in theirs and in the commons' ears will vouch the truth of it him i accuse the city ports by this hath entered and intends t' appear before the people hoping to purge himself with words dispatch most welcome even so as with a man by his own alms empoisoned and with his charity slain sir i cannot tell we must proceed as we do find the people i know it and my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction i raised him and i pawned mine honor for his truth who being so heightened he watered his new plants with dews of flattery seducing so my friends and to this end he bowed his nature never known before but to be rough unswayable and free that i would have spoke of being banished for 't he came unto my hearth presented to my knife his throat i took him made him joint servant with me gave him way in all his own desires nay let him choose out of my files his projects to accomplish my best and freshest men served his designments in mine own person holp to reap the fame which he did end all his and took some pride to do myself this wrong till at the last i seemed his follower not partner and he waged me with his countenance as if i had been mercenary there was it for which my sinews shall be stretched upon him at a few drops of women's rheum which are as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labor of our great action therefore shall he die and i'll renew me in his fall but hark say no more here come the lords i have not deserved it but worthy lords have you with heed perused what i have written to you he approaches you shall hear him read it not noble lords but tell the traitor in the highest degree he hath abused your powers ay traitor martius ay martius caius martius dost thou think i'll grace thee with that robbery thy stol'n name coriolanus in corioles you lords and heads o' th' state perfidiously he has betrayed your business and given up for certain drops of salt your city rome  i say your city to his wife and mother breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk never admitting counsel o' th' war but at his nurse's tears he whined and roared away your victory that pages blushed at him and men of heart looked wond'ring each at other name not the god thou boy of tears no more why noble lords will you be put in mind of his blind fortune which was your shame by this unholy braggart 'fore your own eyes and ears insolent villain my noble masters hear me speak my lords when you shall know as in this rage provoked by him you cannot the great danger which this man's life did owe you you'll rejoice that he is thus cut off please it your honors to call me to your senate i'll deliver myself your loyal servant or endure your heaviest censure my rage is gone and i am struck with sorrow take him up help three o' th' chiefest soldiers i'll be one  beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully  trail your steel pikes though in this city he hath widowed and unchilded many a one which to this hour bewail the injury yet he shall have a noble memory assist
