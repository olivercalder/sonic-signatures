where is my gracious lord of canterbury send for him good uncle not yet my cousin we would be resolved before we hear him of some things of weight that task our thoughts concerning us and france sure we thank you my learnèd lord we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salic that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate whose right suits not in native colors with the truth for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to therefore take heed how you impawn our person how you awake our sleeping sword of war we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint 'gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords that makes such waste in brief mortality under this conjuration speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience washed as pure as sin with baptism may i with right and conscience make this claim we must not only arm t' invade the french but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot who will make road upon us with all advantages we do not mean the coursing snatchers only but fear the main intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us for you shall read that my great grandfather never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnished kingdom came pouring like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fullness of his force galling the gleanèd land with hot assays girding with grievous siege castles and towns that england being empty of defense hath shook and trembled at th' ill neighborhood call in the messengers sent from the dauphin now are we well resolved and by god's help and yours the noble sinews of our power france being ours we'll bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces or there we'll sit ruling in large and ample empery o'er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms or lay these bones in an unworthy urn tombless with no remembrance over them either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts or else our grave like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth not worshiped with a waxen epitaph now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear your greeting is from him not from the king we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as is our wretches fettered in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurbèd plainness tell us the dauphin's mind what treasure uncle we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us his present and your pains we thank you for when we have matched our rackets to these balls we will in france by god's grace play a set shall strike his father's crown into the hazard tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturbed with chases and we understand him well how he comes o'er us with our wilder days not measuring what use we made of them we never valued this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous license as 'tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home but tell the dauphin i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france for that i have laid by my majesty and plodded like a man for working days but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turned his balls to gun stones and his soul shall stand sore chargèd for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands mock mothers from their sons mock castles down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphin's scorn but this lies all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a well hallowed cause so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savor but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it  convey them with safe conduct fare you well we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furth'rance to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business therefore let our proportions for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings for god before we'll chide this dauphin at his father's door therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought now sits the wind fair and we will aboard  my lord of cambridge and my kind lord of masham and you my gentle knight give me your thoughts think you not that the powers we bear with us will cut their passage through the force of france doing the execution and the act for which we have in head assembled them i doubt not that since we are well persuaded we carry not a heart with us from hence that grows not in a fair consent with ours nor leave not one behind that doth not wish success and conquest to attend on us we therefore have great cause of thankfulness and shall forget the office of our hand sooner than quittance of desert and merit according to the weight and worthiness we judge no less uncle of exeter enlarge the man committed yesterday that railed against our person we consider it was excess of wine that set him on and on his more advice we pardon him o let us yet be merciful alas your too much love and care of me are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch if little faults proceeding on distemper shall not be winked at how shall we stretch our eye when capital crimes chewed swallowed and digested appear before us we'll yet enlarge that man though cambridge scroop and grey in their dear care and tender preservation of our person would have him punished and now to our french causes who are the late commissioners then richard earl of cambridge there is yours  there yours lord scroop of masham and sir knight grey of northumberland this same is yours  read them and know i know your worthiness  my lord of westmoreland and uncle exeter we will aboard tonight why how now gentlemen what see you in those papers that you lose so much complexion look you how they change their cheeks are paper why what read you there that have so cowarded and chased your blood out of appearance the mercy that was quick in us but late by your own counsel is suppressed and killed you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy for your own reasons turn into your bosoms as dogs upon their masters worrying you  see you my princes and my noble peers these english monsters my lord of cambridge here you know how apt our love was to accord to furnish him with all appurtenants belonging to his honor and this man hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired and sworn unto the practices of france to kill us here in hampton to the which this knight no less for bounty bound to us than cambridge is hath likewise sworn but o what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel ingrateful savage and inhuman creature thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels that knew'st the very bottom of my soul that almost mightst have coined me into gold wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use  may it be possible that foreign hire could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger 'tis so strange that though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white my eye will scarcely see it treason and murder ever kept together as two yoke devils sworn to either's purpose working so grossly in a natural cause that admiration did not whoop at them but thou 'gainst all proportion didst bring in wonder to wait on treason and on murder and whatsoever cunning fiend it was that wrought upon thee so preposterously hath got the voice in hell for excellence all other devils that suggest by treasons do botch and bungle up damnation with patches colors and with forms being fetched from glist'ring semblances of piety but he that tempered thee bade thee stand up gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason unless to dub thee with the name of traitor if that same demon that hath gulled thee thus should with his lion gait walk the whole world he might return to vasty tartar back and tell the legions i can never win a soul so easy as that englishman's o how hast thou with jealousy infected the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful why so didst thou seem they grave and learnèd why so didst thou come they of noble family why so didst thou seem they religious why so didst thou or are they spare in diet free from gross passion or of mirth or anger constant in spirit not swerving with the blood garnished and decked in modest complement not working with the eye without the ear and but in purgèd judgment trusting neither such and so finely bolted didst thou seem and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot to mark the full fraught man and best endued with some suspicion i will weep for thee for this revolt of thine methinks is like another fall of man their faults are open arrest them to the answer of the law and god acquit them of their practices god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence you have conspired against our royal person joined with an enemy proclaimed and from his coffers received the golden earnest of our death wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter his princes and his peers to servitude his subjects to oppression and contempt and his whole kingdom into desolation touching our person seek we no revenge but we our kingdom's safety must so tender whose ruin you have sought that to her laws we do deliver you get you therefore hence poor miserable wretches to your death the taste whereof god of his mercy give you patience to endure and true repentance of all your dear offenses bear them hence now lords for france the enterprise whereof shall be to you as us like glorious we doubt not of a fair and lucky war since god so graciously hath brought to light this dangerous treason lurking in our way to hinder our beginnings we doubt not now but every rub is smoothèd on our way then forth dear countrymen let us deliver our puissance into the hand of god putting it straight in expedition cheerly to sea the signs of war advance no king of england if not king of france once more unto the breach dear friends once more or close the wall up with our english dead in peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility but when the blast of war blows in our ears then imitate the action of the tiger stiffen the sinews summon up the blood disguise fair nature with hard favored rage then lend the eye a terrible aspect let it pry through the portage of the head like the brass cannon let the brow o'erwhelm it as fearfully as doth a gallèd rock o'erhang and jutty his confounded base swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height on on you noblest english whose blood is fet from fathers of war proof fathers that like so many alexanders have in these parts from morn till even fought and sheathed their swords for lack of argument dishonor not your mothers now attest that those whom you called fathers did beget you be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war and you good yeomen whose limbs were made in england show us here the mettle of your pasture let us swear that you are worth your breeding which i doubt not for there is none of you so mean and base that hath not noble luster in your eyes i see you stand like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start the game's afoot follow your spirit and upon this charge cry god for harry england and saint george how yet resolves the governor of the town this is the latest parle we will admit therefore to our best mercy give yourselves or like to men proud of destruction defy us to our worst for as i am a soldier a name that in my thoughts becomes me best if i begin the batt'ry once again i will not leave the half achieved harfleur till in her ashes she lie burièd the gates of mercy shall be all shut up and the fleshed soldier rough and hard of heart in liberty of bloody hand shall range with conscience wide as hell mowing like grass your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants what is it then to me if impious war arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends do with his smirched complexion all fell feats enlinked to waste and desolation what is 't to me when you yourselves are cause if your pure maidens fall into the hand of hot and forcing violation what rein can hold licentious wickedness when down the hill he holds his fierce career we may as bootless spend our vain command upon th' enragèd soldiers in their spoil as send precepts to the leviathan to come ashore therefore you men of harfleur take pity of your town and of your people whiles yet my soldiers are in my command whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace o'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds of heady murder spoil and villainy if not why in a moment look to see the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand desire the locks of your shrill shrieking daughters your fathers taken by the silver beards and their most reverend heads dashed to the walls your naked infants spitted upon pikes whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry at herod's bloody hunting slaughtermen what say you will you yield and this avoid or guilty in defense be thus destroyed open your gates come uncle exeter go you and enter harfleur there remain and fortify it strongly 'gainst the french use mercy to them all for us dear uncle the winter coming on and sickness growing upon our soldiers we will retire to calais tonight in harfleur will we be your guest tomorrow for the march are we addressed how now fluellen cam'st thou from the bridge what men have you lost fluellen we would have all such offenders so cut off and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages nothing taken but paid for none of the french upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the gentler gamester is the soonest winner well then i know thee what shall i know of thee unfold it what is thy name i know thy quality thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back and tell thy king i do not seek him now but could be willing to march on to calais without impeachment for to say the sooth though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much unto an enemy of craft and vantage my people are with sickness much enfeebled my numbers lessened and those few i have almost no better than so many french who when they were in health i tell thee herald i thought upon one pair of english legs did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god that i do brag thus this your air of france hath blown that vice in me i must repent go therefore tell thy master here i am my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk my army but a weak and sickly guard yet god before tell him we will come on though france himself and such another neighbor stand in our way there's for thy labor montjoy go bid thy master well advise himself if we may pass we will if we be hindered we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolor and so montjoy fare you well the sum of all our answer is but this we would not seek a battle as we are nor as we are we say we will not shun it so tell your master we are in god's hand brother not in theirs march to the bridge it now draws toward night beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves and on tomorrow bid them march away gloucester 'tis true that we are in great danger the greater therefore should our courage be  good morrow brother bedford god almighty there is some soul of goodness in things evil would men observingly distill it out for our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers which is both healthful and good husbandry besides they are our outward consciences and preachers to us all admonishing that we should dress us fairly for our end thus may we gather honey from the weed and make a moral of the devil himself good morrow old sir thomas erpingham a good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of france 'tis good for men to love their present pains upon example so the spirit is eased and when the mind is quickened out of doubt the organs though defunct and dead before break up their drowsy grave and newly move with casted slough and fresh legerity lend me thy cloak sir thomas brothers both commend me to the princes in our camp do my good morrow to them and anon desire them all to my pavilion no my good knight go with my brothers to my lords of england i and my bosom must debate awhile and then i would no other company god a mercy old heart thou speak'st cheerfully a friend i am a gentleman of a company even so what are you then you are a better than the king harry le roy no i am a welshman yes do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yours and his kinsman too i thank you god be with you it sorts well with your fierceness though it appear a little out of fashion there is much care and valor in this welshman a friend under sir thomas erpingham even as men wracked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tide no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds methinks i could not die anywhere so contented as in the king's company his cause being just and his quarrel honorable so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his master's command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servant's damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrament of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is his vengeance so that here men are punished for before breach of the king's laws in now the king's quarrel where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited every subject's duty is the king's but every subject's soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed if i live to see it i will never trust his word after your reproof is something too round i should be angry with you if the time were convenient i embrace it give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it i will make it my quarrel there if ever i live to see it i will challenge it well i will do it though i take thee in the king's company indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no english treason to cut french crowns and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper upon the king let us our lives our souls our debts our careful wives our children and our sins lay on the king we must bear all o hard condition twin born with greatness subject to the breath of every fool whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing what infinite heart's ease must kings neglect that private men enjoy and what have kings that privates have not too save ceremony save general ceremony and what art thou thou idol ceremony what kind of god art thou that suffer'st more of mortal griefs than do thy worshipers what are thy rents what are thy comings in o ceremony show me but thy worth what is thy soul of adoration art thou aught else but place degree and form creating awe and fear in other men wherein thou art less happy being feared than they in fearing what drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet but poisoned flattery o be sick great greatness and bid thy ceremony give thee cure think'st thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation will it give place to flexure and low bending canst thou when thou command'st the beggar's knee command the health of it no thou proud dream that play'st so subtly with a king's repose i am a king that find thee and i know 'tis not the balm the scepter and the ball the sword the mace the crown imperial the intertissued robe of gold and pearl the farcèd title running 'fore the king the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world no not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony not all these laid in bed majestical can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave who with a body filled and vacant mind gets him to rest crammed with distressful bread never sees horrid night the child of hell but like a lackey from the rise to set sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night sleeps in elysium next day after dawn doth rise and help hyperion to his horse and follows so the ever running year with profitable labor to his grave and but for ceremony such a wretch winding up days with toil and nights with sleep had the forehand and vantage of a king the slave a member of the country's peace enjoys it but in gross brain little wots what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace whose hours the peasant best advantages good old knight collect them all together at my tent i'll be before thee o god of battles steel my soldiers' hearts possess them not with fear take from them now the sense of reck'ning or th' opposèd numbers pluck their hearts from them not today o lord o not today think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown i richard's body have interrèd new and on it have bestowed more contrite tears than from it issued forcèd drops of blood five hundred poor i have in yearly pay who twice a day their withered hands hold up toward heaven to pardon blood and i have built two chantries where the sad and solemn priests sing still for richard's soul more will i do  though all that i can do is nothing worth since that my penitence comes after all imploring pardon my brother gloucester's voice ay i know thy errand i will go with thee the day my friends and all things stay for me what's he that wishes so my cousin westmoreland no my fair cousin if we are marked to die we are enough to do our country loss and if to live the fewer men the greater share of honor god's will i pray thee wish not one man more by jove i am not covetous for gold nor care i who doth feed upon my cost it yearns me not if men my garments wear such outward things dwell not in my desires but if it be a sin to covet honor i am the most offending soul alive no 'faith my coz wish not a man from england god's peace i would not lose so great an honor as one man more methinks would share from me for the best hope i have o do not wish one more rather proclaim it westmoreland through my host that he which hath no stomach to this fight let him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy put into his purse we would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us this day is called the feast of crispian he that outlives this day and comes safe home will stand o' tiptoe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of crispian he that shall see this day and live old age will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say tomorrow is saint crispian then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars old men forget yet all shall be forgot but he'll remember with advantages what feats he did that day then shall our names familiar in his mouth as household words harry the king bedford and exeter warwick and talbot salisbury and gloucester be in their flowing cups freshly remembered this story shall the good man teach his son and crispin crispian shall ne'er go by from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be rememberèd  we few we happy few we band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile this day shall gentle his condition and gentlemen in england now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon saint crispin's day all things are ready if our minds be so thou dost not wish more help from england coz why now thou hast unwished five thousand men which likes me better than to wish us one  you know your places god be with you all who hath sent thee now i pray thee bear my former answer back bid them achieve me and then sell my bones good god why should they mock poor fellows thus the man that once did sell the lion's skin while the beast lived was killed with hunting him a many of our bodies shall no doubt find native graves upon the which i trust shall witness live in brass of this day's work and those that leave their valiant bones in france dying like men though buried in your dunghills they shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them and draw their honors reeking up to heaven leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france mark then abounding valor in our english that being dead like to the bullet's crazing break out into a second course of mischief killing in relapse of mortality let me speak proudly tell the constable we are but warriors for the working day our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched with rainy marching in the painful field there's not a piece of feather in our host  good argument i hope we will not fly  and time hath worn us into slovenry but by the mass our hearts are in the trim and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night they'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck the gay new coats o'er the french soldiers' heads and turn them out of service if they do this as if god please they shall my ransom then will soon be levied herald save thou thy labor come thou no more for ransom gentle herald they shall have none i swear but these my joints which if they have as i will leave 'em them shall yield them little tell the constable i fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom take it brave york now soldiers march away and how thou pleasest god dispose the day well have we done thrice valiant countrymen but all's not done yet keep the french the field lives he good uncle thrice within this hour i saw him down thrice up again and fighting from helmet to the spur all blood he was i blame you not for hearing this i must perforce compound with my full eyes or they will issue too but hark what new alarum is this same the french have reinforced their scattered men then every soldier kill his prisoners give the word through i was not angry since i came to france until this instant take a trumpet herald ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill if they will fight with us bid them come down or void the field they do offend our sight if they'll do neither we will come to them and make them skirr away as swift as stones enforcèd from the old assyrian slings besides we'll cut the throats of those we have and not a man of them that we shall take shall taste our mercy go and tell them so how now what means this herald know'st thou not that i have fined these bones of mine for ransom com'st thou again for ransom i tell thee truly herald i know not if the day be ours or no for yet a many of your horsemen peer and gallop o'er the field praised be god and not our strength for it what is this castle called that stands hard by then call we this the field of agincourt fought on the day of crispin crispianus they did fluellen i wear it for a memorable honor for i am welsh you know good countryman thanks good my

nobles bearing banners there lie dead one hundred twenty six added to these of knights esquires and gallant gentlemen eight thousand and four hundred of the which five hundred were but yesterday

praise from god which is his only yes captain but with this acknowledgment that god fought for us do we all holy rites let there be sung non nobis and te deum the dead with charity enclosed in clay and then to calais and to england then where ne'er from france arrived more happy men peace to this meeting wherefor we are met unto our brother france and to our sister health and fair time of day joy and good wishes to our most fair and princely cousin katherine  and as a branch and member of this royalty by whom this great assembly is contrived we do salute you duke of burgundy  and princes french and peers health to you all to cry amen to that thus we appear if duke of burgundy you would the peace whose want gives growth to th' imperfections which you have cited you must buy that peace with full accord to all our just demands whose tenors and particular effects you have enscheduled briefly in your hands well then the peace which you before so urged lies in his answer brother we shall go uncle exeter and brother clarence and you brother gloucester warwick and huntington go with the king and take with you free power to ratify augment or alter as your wisdoms best shall see advantageable for our dignity anything in or out of our demands and we'll consign thereto will you fair sister go with the princes or stay here with us yet leave our cousin katherine here with us she is our capital demand comprised within the forerank of our articles fair katherine and most fair will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady's ear and plead his love suit to her gentle heart o fair katherine if you will love me soundly with your french heart i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue do you like me kate an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel i said so dear katherine and i must not blush to affirm it what says she fair one that the tongues of men are full of deceits the princess is the better englishwoman  i' faith kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding i am glad thou canst speak no better english for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my crown i know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say i love you then if you urge me farther than to say do you in faith i wear out my suit give me your answer i' faith do and so clap hands and a bargain how say you lady marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake kate why you undid me for the one i have neither words nor measure and for the other i have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength if i could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken i should quickly leap into a wife or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favors i could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes never off but before god kate i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor i have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which i never use till urged nor never break for urging if thou canst love a fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth sun burning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook i speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that i shall die is true but for thy love by the lord no yet i love thee too and while thou liv'st dear kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors they do always reason themselves out again what a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly if thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king and what say'st thou then to my love speak my fair and fairly i pray thee no it is not possible you should love the enemy of france kate but in loving me you should love the friend of france for i love france so well that i will not part with a village of it i will have it all mine and kate when france is mine and i am yours then yours is france and you are mine no kate i will tell thee in french which i am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new married wife about her husband's neck hardly to be shook off je quand sur le possession de france et quand vous avez le possession de moi let me see what then saint denis be my speed donc vôtre est france et vous êtes mienne it is as easy for me kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more french i shall never move thee in french unless it be to laugh at me no faith is 't not kate but thy speaking of my tongue and i thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one but kate dost thou understand thus much english canst thou love me can any of your neighbors tell kate i'll ask them come i know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet you'll question this gentlewoman about me and i know kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart but good kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because i love thee cruelly if ever thou beest mine kate as i have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt i get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier breeder shall not thou and i between saint denis and saint george compound a boy half french half english that shall go to constantinople and take the turk by the beard shall we not what say'st thou my fair flower de luce no 'tis hereafter to know but now to promise do but now promise kate you will endeavor for your french part of such a boy and for my english moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor how answer you la plus belle katherine du monde mon très cher et divin déesse now fie upon my false french by mine honor in true english i love thee kate by which honor i dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage now beshrew my father's ambition he was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was i created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when i come to woo ladies i fright them but in faith kate the elder i wax the better i shall appear my comfort is that old age that ill layer up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better and therefore tell me most fair katherine will you have me put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say harry of england i am thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but i will tell thee aloud england is thine ireland is thine france is thine and henry plantagenet is thine who though i speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good fellows come your answer in broken music for thy voice is music and thy english broken therefore queen of all katherine break thy mind to me in broken english wilt thou have me nay it will please him well kate it shall please him kate upon that i kiss your hand and i call you my queen then i will kiss your lips kate madam my interpreter what says she to kiss it is not a

kiss therefore patiently and yielding you have witchcraft in your lips kate there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the french council and they should sooner persuade harry of england than a general petition of monarchs here comes your father i would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly i love her and that is good english our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me i cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and so i shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she must be blind too it is so and you may some of you thank love for my blindness who cannot see many a fair french city for one fair french maid that stands in my way shall kate be my wife i

alliance let that one article rank with the rest and thereupon give me your daughter now welcome kate and bear me witness all that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen amen prepare we for our marriage on which day my lord of burgundy we'll take your oath and all the peers' for surety of our leagues then shall i swear to kate and you to me and may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be
