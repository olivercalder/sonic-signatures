hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laborsome petition and at last upon his will i sealed my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stayed for there my blessing with thee and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportioned thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatched unfledged courage beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear 't that th' opposèd may beware of thee give every man thy ear but few thy voice take each man's censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not expressed in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee the time invests you go your servants tend what is 't ophelia he hath said to you marry well bethought 'tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so 'tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behooves my daughter and your honor what is between you give me up the truth affection puh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them marry i will teach you think yourself a baby that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase running it thus you'll tender me a fool ay fashion you may call it go to go to ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parle for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to 't i charge you come your ways give him this money and these notes reynaldo you shall do marvelous wisely good reynaldo before you visit him to make inquire of his behavior marry well said very well said look you sir inquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part him do you mark this reynaldo and in part him but you may say not well but if 't be he i mean he's very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonor him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty ay or drinking fencing swearing quarreling drabbing you may go so far faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that's not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimèd blood of general assault wherefore should you do this marry sir here's my drift and i believe it is a fetch of wit you laying these slight sullies on my son as 'twere a thing a little soiled i' th' working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assured he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country  and then sir does he this he does what was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence ay marry  he closes thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or th' other day or then or then with such or such and as you say there was he gaming there o'ertook in 's rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale  videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood take this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not god be wi' you fare you well observe his inclination in yourself and let him ply his music farewell how now ophelia what's the matter with what i' th' name of god mad for thy love what said he come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passions under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not coted him i feared he did but trifle and meant to wrack thee but beshrew my jealousy by heaven it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love come th' ambassadors from norway my good lord are joyfully returned have i my lord i assure my good liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath used to do that i have found the very cause of hamlet's lunacy give first admittance to th' ambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is 't but to be nothing else but mad but let that go madam i swear i use no art at all that he's mad 'tis true 'tis true 'tis pity and pity 'tis 'tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have while she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this now gather and surmise to the celestial and my soul's idol the most beautified ophelia  that's an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear thus in her excellent white bosom these etc  good madam stay awhile i will be faithful doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers i have not art to reckon my groans but that i love thee best o most best believe it adieu thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter shown me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear what do you think of me i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceived it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had played the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or looked upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i prescripts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repelled a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we mourn for hath there been such a time i would fain know that that i have positively said 'tis so when it proved otherwise take this from this if this be otherwise if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the center you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby at such a time i'll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall'n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters away i do beseech you both away i'll board him presently o give me leave how does my good lord hamlet do you know me my lord not i my lord honest my lord that's very true my lord i have my lord how say you by that still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i'll speak to him again what do you read my lord what is the matter my lord i mean the matter that you read my lord though this be madness yet there is method in 't will you walk out of the air my lord indeed that's out of the air how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my lord i will take my leave of you fare you well my lord you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is well be with you gentlemen my lord i have news to tell you the actors are come hither my lord upon my honor  the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoral comical historical pastoral tragical historical tragical comical historical pastoral scene individable or poem unlimited seneca cannot be too heavy nor plautus too light for the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men what a treasure had he my lord still on my daughter if you call me jephthah my lord i have a daughter that i love passing well what follows then my lord 'fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion this is too long that's good moblèd queen is good look whe'er he has not turned his color and has tears in 's eyes prithee no more my lord i will use them according to their desert come sirs 'tis most true and he beseeched me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves read on this book that show of such an exercise may color your loneliness we are oft to blame in this 'tis too much proved that with devotion's visage and pious action we do sugar o'er the devil himself i hear him coming let's withdraw my lord it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i'll be placed so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think and the queen too and that presently that did i my lord and was accounted a good actor i did enact julius caesar i was killed i' th' capitol brutus killed me oh ho do you mark that give o'er the play lights lights lights my lord the queen would speak with you and presently by th' mass and 'tis like a camel indeed it is backed like a weasel very like a whale i will say so my lord he's going to his mother's closet behind the arras i'll convey myself to hear the process i'll warrant she'll tax him home and as you said and wisely was it said 'tis meet that some more audience than a mother since nature makes them partial should o'erhear the speech of vantage fare you well my liege i'll call upon you ere you go to bed and tell you what i know he will come straight look you lay home to him tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with and that your grace hath screened and stood between much heat and him i'll silence me even here pray you be round with him what ho help o i am slain
