he has no equal marked you his lip and eyes being moved he will not spare to gird the gods  the present wars devour him he is grown too proud to be so valiant fame at the which he aims in whom already he's well graced cannot better be held nor more attained than by a place below the first for what miscarries shall be the general's fault though he perform to th' utmost of a man and giddy censure will then cry out of martius o if he had borne the business come half all cominius' honors are to martius though martius earned them not and all his faults to martius shall be honors though indeed in aught he merit not let's along good or bad he's a lamb indeed that baas like a bear well sir he's poor in no one fault but stored with all and topping all others in boasting why how are we censured well well sir well we do it not alone sir what then sir come sir come we know you well enough come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol all tongues speak of him and the blearèd sights are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse into a rapture lets her baby cry while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck clamb'ring the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows are smothered up leads filled and ridges horsed with variable complexions all agreeing in earnestness to see him seld shown flamens do press among the popular throngs and puff to win a vulgar station our veiled dames commit the war of white and damask in their nicely gauded cheeks to th' wanton spoil of phoebus' burning kisses such a pother as if that whatsoever god who leads him were slyly crept into his human powers and gave him graceful posture then our office may during his power go sleep in that there's comfort i heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would he appear i' th' marketplace nor on him put the napless vesture of humility nor showing as the manner is his wounds to th' people beg their stinking breaths it was his word o he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him and the desire of the nobles 'tis most like he will so it must fall out to him or our authority's for an end we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them that to 's power he would have made them mules silenced their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms holding them in human action and capacity of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in their war who have their provand only for bearing burdens and sore blows for sinking under them what's the matter let's to the capitol and carry with us ears and eyes for th' time but hearts for the event which the rather we shall be blest to do if he remember a kinder value of the people than he hath hereto prized them at most willingly but yet my caution was more pertinent than the rebuke you give it sir i hope my words disbenched you not mark you that you see how he intends to use the people come we'll inform them of our proceedings here on th' marketplace i know they do attend us we stay here for the people with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds will you dismiss the people we pray the gods he may deserve your loves could you not have told him as you were lessoned when he had no power but was a petty servant to the state he was your enemy ever spake against your liberties and the charters that you bear i' th' body of the weal and now arriving a place of potency and sway o' th' state if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to th' plebeii your voices might be curses to yourselves you should have said that as his worthy deeds did claim no less than what he stood for so his gracious nature would think upon you for your voices and translate his malice towards you into love standing your friendly lord did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush why had your bodies no heart among you or had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of judgment get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties make them of no more voice than dogs that are as often beat for barking as therefor kept to do so lay a fault on us your tribunes that we labored no impediment between but that you must cast your election on him ay spare us not say we read lectures to you how youngly he began to serve his country how long continued and what stock he springs of the noble house o' th' martians from whence came that ancus martius numa's daughter's son who after great hostilius here was king of the same house publius and quintus were that our best water brought by conduits hither and censorinus that was so surnamed and nobly namèd so twice being censor was his great ancestor say you ne'er had done 't  harp on that still but by our putting on and presently when you have drawn your number repair to th' capitol let them go on this mutiny were better put in hazard than stay past doubt for greater if as his nature is he fall in rage with their refusal both observe and answer the vantage of his anger it will be dangerous to go on no further cominius no the people are incensed against him call 't not a plot the people cry you mocked them and of late when corn was given them gratis you repined scandaled the suppliants for the people called them timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness not to them all how i inform them not unlike each way to better yours you speak o' th' people as if you were a god to punish not a man of their infirmity why shall the people give one that speaks thus their voice enough with over measure 'has said enough manifest treason the aediles ho let him be apprehended seize him aediles peace peace peace stay hold peace by the consent of all we were established the people's magistrates or let us stand to our authority or let us lose it we do here pronounce upon the part o' th' people in whose power we were elected theirs martius is worthy of present death aediles seize him sir those cold ways that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous where the disease is violent lay hands upon him and bear him to the rock lay hands upon him he consul merely awry when he did love his country it honored him we'll hear no more pursue him to his house and pluck him thence lest his infection being of catching nature spread further if it were so  go not home in this point charge him home that he affects tyrannical power if he evade us there enforce him with his envy to the people and that the spoil got on the antiates was ne'er distributed what will he come how accompanied and when such time they have begun to cry let them not cease but with a din confused enforce the present execution of what we chance to sentence go about it put him to choler straight he hath been used ever to conquer and to have his worth of contradiction being once chafed he cannot be reined again to temperance then he speaks what's in his heart and that is there which looks with us to break his neck well say peace ho but since he hath served well for rome  i talk of that that know it there's no more to be said but he is banished as enemy to the people and his country it shall be so now we have shown our power let us seem humbler after it is done than when it was a doing dismiss them home here comes his mother why they have ta'en note of us keep on your way i would he had pray let's go well well we'll leave you we stood to 't in good time is this menenius good e'en to you all good e'en to you all farewell kind neighbors we wished coriolanus had loved you as we did farewell farewell caius martius was a worthy officer i' th' war but insolent o'ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking self loving the gods have well prevented it and rome sits safe and still without him go see this rumorer whipped it cannot be the volsces dare break with us not possible raised only that the weaker sort may wish good martius home again but is this true sir say not we brought it i do not like this news let's to the capitol would half my wealth would buy this for a lie only make trial what your love can do for rome towards martius you know the very road into his kindness and cannot lose your way
