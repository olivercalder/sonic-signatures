within the temple hall we were too loud the garden here is more convenient faith i have been a truant in the law and never yet could frame my will to it and therefore frame the law unto my will i pluck this red rose with young somerset and say withal i think he held the right turn not thy scorns this way plantagenet i'll turn my part thereof into thy throat go forward and be choked with thy ambition and so farewell until i meet thee next welcome high prince the mighty duke of york be what thou wilt thou art my prisoner o fairest beauty do not fear nor fly for i will touch thee but with reverent hands i kiss these fingers for eternal peace and lay them gently on thy tender side who art thou say that i may honor thee an earl i am and suffolk am i called be not offended nature's miracle thou art allotted to be ta'en by me so doth the swan her downy cygnets save keeping them prisoner underneath her wings yet if this servile usage once offend go and be free again as suffolk's friend o stay i have no power to let her pass my hand would free her but my heart says no as plays the sun upon the glassy streams twinkling another counterfeited beam so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes fain would i woo her yet i dare not speak i'll call for pen and ink and write my mind fie de la pole disable not thyself hast not a tongue is she not here wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight ay beauty's princely majesty is such confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit before thou make a trial of her love she's beautiful and therefore to be wooed she is a woman therefore to be won fond man remember that thou hast a wife then how can margaret be thy paramour there all is marred there lies a cooling card and yet a dispensation may be had i'll win this lady margaret for whom why for my king tush that's a wooden thing yet so my fancy may be satisfied and peace establishèd between these realms but there remains a scruple in that too for though her father be the king of naples duke of anjou and maine yet is he poor and our nobility will scorn the match it shall be so disdain they ne'er so much henry is youthful and will quickly yield  madam i have a secret to reveal lady vouchsafe to listen what i say sweet madam give me hearing in a cause lady wherefore talk you so say gentle princess would you not suppose your bondage happy to be made a queen and so shall you if happy england's royal king be free i'll undertake to make thee henry's queen to put a golden scepter in thy hand and set a precious crown upon thy head if thou wilt condescend to be my  his love no gentle madam i unworthy am to woo so fair a dame to be his wife and have no portion in the choice myself how say you madam are you so content then call our captains and our colors forth and madam at your father's castle walls we'll crave a parley to confer with him see reignier see thy daughter prisoner to me yes there is remedy enough my lord consent and for thy honor give consent thy daughter shall be wedded to my king whom i with pain have wooed and won thereto and this her easy held imprisonment hath gained thy daughter princely liberty fair margaret knows that suffolk doth not flatter face or feign and here i will expect thy coming thanks reignier happy for so sweet a child fit to be made companion with a king what answer makes your grace unto my suit that is her ransom i deliver her and those two counties i will undertake your grace shall well and quietly enjoy reignier of france i give thee kingly thanks because this is in traffic of a king and yet methinks i could be well content to be mine own attorney in this case  i'll over then to england with this news and make this marriage to be solemnized so farewell reignier set this diamond safe in golden palaces as it becomes farewell sweet madam but hark you margaret no princely commendations to my king words sweetly placed and modestly directed but madam i must trouble you again no loving token to his majesty and this withal o wert thou for myself but suffolk stay thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth there minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk solicit henry with her wondrous praise bethink thee on her virtues that surmount and natural graces that extinguish art repeat their semblance often on the seas that when thou com'st to kneel at henry's feet thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder tush my good lord this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them would make a volume of enticing lines able to ravish any dull conceit and which is more she is not so divine so full replete with choice of all delights but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command  command i mean of virtuous chaste intents  to love and honor henry as her lord as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths or one that at a triumph having vowed to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversary's odds a poor earl's daughter is unequal odds and therefore may be broke without offense yes my lord her father is a king the king of naples and jerusalem and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance a dower my lords disgrace not so your king that he should be so abject base and poor to choose for wealth and not for perfect love henry is able to enrich his queen and not to seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives as market men for oxen sheep or horse marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship not whom we will but whom his grace affects must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore lords since he affects her most most of all these reasons bindeth us in our opinions she should be preferred for what is wedlock forcèd but a hell an age of discord and continual strife whereas the contrary bringeth bliss and is a pattern of celestial peace whom should we match with henry being a king but margaret that is daughter to a king her peerless feature joinèd with her birth approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit more than in women commonly is seen will answer our hope in issue of a king for henry son unto a conqueror is likely to beget more conquerors if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be linked in love then yield my lords and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen and none but she thus suffolk hath prevailed and thus he goes as did the youthful paris once to greece with hope to find the like event in love but prosper better than the trojan did margaret shall now be queen and rule the king but i will rule both her the king and realm
