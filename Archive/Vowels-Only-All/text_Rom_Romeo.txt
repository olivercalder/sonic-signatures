is the day so young ay me sad hours seem long was that my father that went hence so fast not having that which having makes them short out  out of her favor where i am in love alas that love whose view is muffled still should without eyes see pathways to his will where shall we dine o me what fray was here yet tell me not for i have heard it all here's much to do with hate but more with love why then o brawling love o loving hate o anything of nothing first create o heavy lightness serious vanity misshapen chaos of well seeming forms feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health still waking sleep that is not what it is this love feel i that feel no love in this dost thou not laugh good heart at what why such is love's transgression griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed with more of thine this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs being purged a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes being vexed a sea nourished with loving tears what is it else a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet farewell my coz tut i have lost myself i am not here this is not romeo he's some other where what shall i groan and tell thee a sick man in sadness makes his will  a word ill urged to one that is so ill in sadness cousin i do love a woman a right good markman and she's fair i love well in that hit you miss she'll not be hit with cupid's arrow she hath dian's wit and in strong proof of chastity well armed from love's weak childish bow she lives uncharmed she will not stay the siege of loving terms nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes nor ope her lap to saint seducing gold o she is rich in beauty only poor that when she dies with beauty dies her store she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste for beauty starved with her severity cuts beauty off from all posterity she is too fair too wise wisely too fair to merit bliss by making me despair she hath forsworn to love and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now o teach me how i should forget to think 'tis the way to call hers exquisite in question more these happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows being black puts us in mind they hide the fair he that is strucken blind cannot forget the precious treasure of his eyesight lost show me a mistress that is passing fair what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who passed that passing fair farewell thou canst not teach me to forget your plantain leaf is excellent for that for your broken shin not mad but bound more than a madman is shut up in prison kept without my food whipped and tormented and good e'en good fellow ay mine own fortune in my misery ay if i know the letters and the language stay fellow i can read signior martino and his wife and daughters county anselme and his beauteous sisters the lady widow of vitruvio signior placentio and his lovely nieces mercutio and his brother valentine mine uncle capulet his wife and daughters my fair niece rosaline and livia signior valentio and his cousin tybalt lucio and the lively helena a fair assembly whither should they come whither to supper whose house indeed i should have asked thee that before when the devout religion of mine eye maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fire and these who often drowned could never die transparent heretics be burnt for liars one fairer than my love the all seeing sun ne'er saw her match since first the world begun i'll go along no such sight to be shown but to rejoice in splendor of mine own what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse or shall we on without apology give me a torch i am not for this ambling being but heavy i will bear the light not i believe me you have dancing shoes with nimble soles i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i cannot move i am too sore enpiercèd with his shaft to soar with his light feathers and so bound i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe under love's heavy burden do i sink is love a tender thing it is too rough too rude too boist'rous and it pricks like thorn a torch for me let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels for i am proverbed with a grandsire phrase i'll be a candle holder and look on the game was ne'er so fair and i am done nay that's not so and we mean well in going to this masque but 'tis no wit to go i dreamt a dream tonight well what was yours in bed asleep while they do dream things true peace peace mercutio peace thou talk'st of nothing i fear too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night's revels and expire the term of a despisèd life closed in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my sail on lusty gentlemen what lady's that which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight o she doth teach the torches to burn bright it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night as a rich jewel in an ethiop's ear  beauty too rich for use for earth too dear so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows the measure done i'll watch her place of stand and touching hers make blessèd my rude hand did my heart love till now forswear it sight for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine the gentle sin is this my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss have not saints lips and holy palmers too o then dear saint let lips do what hands do they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair then move not while my prayer's effect i take thus from my lips by thine my sin is purged sin from my lips o trespass sweetly urged give me my sin again what is her mother is she a capulet o dear account my life is my foe's debt ay so i fear the more is my unrest can i go forward when my heart is here turn back dull earth and find thy center out he jests at scars that never felt a wound but soft what light through yonder window breaks it is the east and juliet is the sun arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she be not her maid since she is envious her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it cast it off it is my lady o it is my love o that she knew she were she speaks yet she says nothing what of that her eye discourses i will answer it i am too bold 'tis not to me she speaks two of the fairest stars in all the heaven having some business do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return what if her eyes were there they in her head the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp her eye in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night see how she leans her cheek upon her hand o that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek she speaks o speak again bright angel for thou art as glorious to this night being o'er my head as is a wingèd messenger of heaven unto the white upturnèd wond'ring eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air shall i hear more or shall i speak at this i take thee at thy word call me but love and i'll be new baptized henceforth i never will be romeo by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am my name dear saint is hateful to myself because it is an enemy to thee had i it written i would tear the word neither fair maid if either thee dislike with love's light wings did i o'erperch these walls for stony limits cannot hold love out and what love can do that dares love attempt therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me alack there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet and i am proof against their enmity i have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes and but thou love me let them find me here my life were better ended by their hate than death proroguèd wanting of thy love by love that first did prompt me to inquire he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes i am no pilot yet wert thou as far as that vast shore washed with the farthest sea i should adventure for such merchandise lady by yonder blessèd moon i vow that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops  what shall i swear by if my heart's dear love  o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine wouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose love o blessèd blessèd night i am afeard being in night all this is but a dream too flattering sweet to be substantial so thrive my soul  a thousand times the worse to want thy light love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books but love from love toward school with heavy looks it is my soul that calls upon my name how silver sweet sound lovers' tongues by night like softest music to attending ears my dear by the hour of nine let me stand here till thou remember it and i'll still stay to have thee still forget forgetting any other home but this i would i were thy bird sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast would i were sleep and peace so sweet to rest hence will i to my ghostly friar's close cell his help to crave and my dear hap to tell good morrow father that last is true the sweeter rest was mine with rosaline my ghostly father no i have forgot that name and that name's woe i'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again i have been feasting with mine enemy where on a sudden one hath wounded me that's by me wounded both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies i bear no hatred blessèd man for lo my intercession likewise steads my foe then plainly know my heart's dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet as mine on hers so hers is set on mine and all combined save what thou must combine by holy marriage when and where and how we met we wooed and made exchange of vow i'll tell thee as we pass but this i pray that thou consent to marry us today thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline and bad'st me bury love i pray thee chide me not her i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow the other did not so o let us hence i stand on sudden haste good morrow to you both what counterfeit did i give you pardon good mercutio my business was great and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy meaning to curtsy a most courteous exposition pink for flower why then is my pump well flowered o single soled jest solely singular for the singleness switch and spurs switch and spurs or i'll cry a match thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose nay good goose bite not and is it not then well served into a sweet goose i stretch it out for that word broad which added to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose here's goodly gear a sail a sail one gentlewoman that god hath made himself to mar i can tell you but young romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him i am the youngest of that name for fault of a worse what hast thou found i will follow you a gentleman nurse that loves to hear himself talk and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress i protest unto thee  what wilt thou tell her nurse thou dost not mark me bid her devise some means to come to shrift this afternoon and there she shall at friar lawrence' cell be shrived and married here is for thy pains go to i say you shall and stay good nurse behind the abbey wall within this hour my man shall be with thee and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair which to the high topgallant of my joy must be my convoy in the secret night farewell be trusty and i'll quit thy pains farewell commend me to thy mistress what sayst thou my dear nurse warrant thee my man's as true as steel ay nurse what of that both with an r commend me to thy lady amen amen but come what sorrow can it cannot countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight do thou but close our hands with holy words then love devouring death do what he dare it is enough i may but call her mine ah juliet if the measure of thy joy be heaped like mine and that thy skill be more to blazon it then sweeten with thy breath this neighbor air and let rich music's tongue unfold the imagined happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter tybalt the reason that i have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting villain am i none therefore farewell i see thou knowest me not i do protest i never injured thee but love thee better than thou canst devise till thou shalt know the reason of my love and so good capulet which name i tender as dearly as mine own be satisfied gentle mercutio put thy rapier up draw benvolio beat down their weapons gentlemen for shame forbear this outrage tybalt mercutio the prince expressly hath forbid this bandying in verona streets hold tybalt good mercutio courage man the hurt cannot be much i thought all for the best this gentleman the prince's near ally my very friend hath got this mortal hurt in my behalf my reputation stained with tybalt's slander tybalt that an hour hath been my cousin o sweet juliet thy beauty hath made me effeminate and in my temper softened valor's steel this day's black fate on more days doth depend this but begins the woe others must end alive in triumph and mercutio slain away to heaven respective lenity and fire eyed fury be my conduct now  now tybalt take the villain back again that late thou gavest me for mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company either thou or i or both must go with him this shall determine that o i am fortune's fool father what news what is the prince's doom what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand that i yet know not what less than doomsday is the prince's doom ha banishment be merciful say death for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death do not say banishment there is no world without verona walls but purgatory torture hell itself hence banishèd is banished from the world and world's exile is death then banishèd is death mistermed calling death banishèd thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax and smilest upon the stroke that murders me 'tis torture and not mercy heaven is here where juliet lives and every cat and dog and little mouse every unworthy thing live here in heaven and may look on her but romeo may not more validity more honorable state more courtship lives in carrion flies than romeo they may seize on the white wonder of dear juliet's hand and steal immortal blessing from her lips who even in pure and vestal modesty still blush as thinking their own kisses sin but romeo may not he is banishèd flies may do this but i from this must fly they are free men but i am banishèd and sayest thou yet that exile is not death hadst thou no poison mixed no sharp ground knife no sudden mean of death though ne'er so mean but banishèd to kill me banishèd o friar the damnèd use that word in hell howling attends it how hast thou the heart being a divine a ghostly confessor a sin absolver and my friend professed to mangle me with that word banishèd o thou wilt speak again of banishment yet banishèd hang up philosophy unless philosophy can make a juliet displant a town reverse a prince's doom it helps not it prevails not talk no more how should they when that wise men have no eyes thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel wert thou as young as i juliet thy love an hour but married tybalt murderèd doting like me and like me banishèd then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair and fall upon the ground as i do now taking the measure of an unmade grave not i unless the breath of heartsick groans mistlike enfold me from the search of eyes nurse spakest thou of juliet how is it with her doth not she think me an old murderer now i have stained the childhood of our joy with blood removed but little from her own where is she and how doth she and what says my concealed lady to our canceled love as if that name shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her as that name's cursèd hand murdered her kinsman o tell me friar tell me in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name lodge tell me that i may sack the hateful mansion do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide how well my comfort is revived by this but that a joy past joy calls out on me it were a grief so brief to part with thee farewell it was the lark the herald of the morn no nightingale look love what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east night's candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops i must be gone and live or stay and die let me be ta'en let me be put to death i am content so thou wilt have it so i'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye 'tis but the pale reflex of cynthia's brow nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads i have more care to stay than will to go come death and welcome juliet wills it so how is 't my soul let's talk it is not day more light and light more dark and dark our woes farewell farewell one kiss and i'll descend farewell i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings love to thee i doubt it not and all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come and trust me love in my eye so do you dry sorrow drinks our blood adieu adieu if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep my dreams presage some joyful news at hand my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts i dreamt my lady came and found me dead strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor ah me how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadows are so rich in joy news from verona how now balthasar dost thou not bring me letters from the friar how doth my lady is my father well how doth my juliet that i ask again for nothing can be ill if she be well is it e'en so then i deny you stars  thou knowest my lodging get me ink and paper and hire post horses i will hence tonight tush thou art deceived leave me and do the thing i bid thee do hast thou no letters to me from the friar no matter get thee gone and hire those horses i'll be with thee straight well juliet i will lie with thee tonight let's see for means o mischief thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men i do remember an apothecary and hereabouts he dwells which late i noted in tattered weeds with overwhelming brows culling of simples meager were his looks sharp misery had worn him to the bones and in his needy shop a tortoise hung an alligator stuffed and other skins of ill shaped fishes and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses were thinly scattered to make up a show noting this penury to myself i said an if a man did need a poison now whose sale is present death in mantua here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him o this same thought did but forerun my need and this same needy man must sell it me as i remember this should be the house being holiday the beggar's shop is shut  what ho apothecary come hither man i see that thou art poor hold there is forty ducats let me have a dram of poison such soon speeding gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the life weary taker may fall dead and that the trunk may be discharged of breath as violently as hasty powder fired doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb art thou so bare and full of wretchedness and fearest to die famine is in thy cheeks need and oppression starveth in thy eyes contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back the world is not thy friend nor the world's law the world affords no law to make thee rich then be not poor but break it and take this i pay thy poverty and not thy will there is thy gold worse poison to men's souls doing more murder in this loathsome world than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh come cordial and not poison go with me to juliet's grave for there must i use thee give me that mattock and the wrenching iron hold take this letter early in the morning see thou deliver it to my lord and father give me the light upon thy life i charge thee whate'er thou hearest or seest stand all aloof and do not interrupt me in my course why i descend into this bed of death is partly to behold my lady's face but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger a precious ring a ring that i must use in dear employment therefore hence begone but if thou jealous dost return to pry in what i farther shall intend to do by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs the time and my intents are savage wild more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea so shalt thou show me friendship take thou that live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow thou detestable maw thou womb of death gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open and in despite i'll cram thee with more food i must indeed and therefore came i hither good gentle youth tempt not a desp'rate man fly hence and leave me think upon these gone let them affright thee i beseech thee youth put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury o begone by heaven i love thee better than myself for i come hither armed against myself stay not begone live and hereafter say a madman's mercy bid thee run away wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy in faith i will let me peruse this face mercutio's kinsman noble county paris what said my man when my betossèd soul did not attend him as we rode i think he told me paris should have married juliet said he not so or did i dream it so or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet to think it was so o give me thy hand one writ with me in sour misfortune's book i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave  a grave o no a lantern slaughtered youth for here lies juliet and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light  death lie thou there by a dead man interred how oft when men are at the point of death have they been merry which their keepers call a light'ning before death o how may i call this a light'ning o my love my wife death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty thou art not conquered beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks and death's pale flag is not advancèd there  tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet o what more favor can i do to thee than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy forgive me cousin ah dear juliet why art thou yet so fair shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous and that the lean abhorrèd monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour for fear of that i still will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night depart again here here will i remain with worms that are thy chambermaids o here will i set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world wearied flesh eyes look your last arms take your last embrace and lips o you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death come bitter conduct come unsavory guide thou desperate pilot now at once run on the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark here's to my love o true apothecary thy drugs are quick thus with a kiss i die
