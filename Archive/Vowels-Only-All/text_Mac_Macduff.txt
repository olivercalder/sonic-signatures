yelled out like syllable of dolor i am not treacherous i have lost my hopes bleed bleed poor country great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure for goodness dare not check thee wear thou thy wrongs the title is affeered fare thee well lord i would not be the villain that thou think'st for the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp and the rich east to boot what should he be not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damned in evils to top macbeth boundless intemperance in nature is a tyranny it hath been th' untimely emptying of the happy throne and fall of many kings but fear not yet to take upon you what is yours you may convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty and yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink we have willing dames enough there cannot be that vulture in you to devour so many as will to greatness dedicate themselves finding it so inclined this avarice sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root than summer seeming lust and it hath been the sword of our slain kings yet do not fear scotland hath foisons to fill up your will of your mere own all these are portable with other graces weighed o scotland scotland fit to govern no not to live o nation miserable with an untitled tyrant bloody sceptered when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again since that the truest issue of thy throne by his own interdiction stands accursed and does blaspheme his breed thy royal father was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee oft'ner upon her knees than on her feet died every day she lived fare thee well these evils thou repeat'st upon thyself hath banished me from scotland o my breast thy hope ends here such welcome and unwelcome things at once 'tis hard to reconcile what's the disease he means see who comes here my ever gentle cousin welcome hither stands scotland where it did o relation too nice and yet too true how does my wife and all my children the tyrant has not battered at their peace be not a niggard of your speech how goes 't what concern they  the general cause or is it a fee grief due to some single breast if it be mine keep it not from me quickly let me have it hum i guess at it my children too and i must be from thence my wife killed too he has no children all my pretty ones did you say all o hell kite all what all my pretty chickens and their dam at one fell swoop i shall do so but i must also feel it as a man i cannot but remember such things were that were most precious to me did heaven look on and would not take their part sinful macduff they were all struck for thee naught that i am not for their own demerits but for mine fell slaughter on their souls heaven rest them now o i could play the woman with mine eyes and braggart with my tongue but gentle heavens cut short all intermission front to front bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself within my sword's length set him if he 'scape heaven forgive him too let our just censures attend the true event and put we on industrious soldiership make all our trumpets speak give them all breath those clamorous harbingers of blood and death that way the noise is tyrant show thy face if thou beest slain and with no stroke of mine my wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still i cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms are hired to bear their staves either thou macbeth or else my sword with an unbattered edge i sheathe again undeeded there thou shouldst be by this great clatter one of greatest note seems bruited let me find him fortune and more i beg not turn hellhound turn i have no words my voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out despair thy charm and let the angel whom thou still hast served tell thee macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripped then yield thee coward and live to be the show and gaze o' th' time we'll have thee as our rarer monsters are painted upon a pole and underwrit here may you see the tyrant hail king for so thou art behold where stands th' usurper's curs√®d head the time is free i see thee compassed with thy kingdom's pearl that speak my salutation in their minds whose voices i desire aloud with mine hail king of scotland hail king of scotland
