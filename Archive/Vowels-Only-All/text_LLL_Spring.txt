when daisies pied and violets blue and lady smocks all silver white and cuckoo buds of yellow hue do paint the meadows with delight the cuckoo then on every tree mocks married men for thus sings he cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo o word of fear unpleasing to a married ear when shepherds pipe on oaten straws and merry larks are plowmen's clocks when turtles tread and rooks and daws and maidens bleach their summer smocks the cuckoo then on every tree mocks married men for thus sings he cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo o word of fear unpleasing to a married ear
