as by your high imperial majesty i had in charge at my depart for france as procurator to your excellence to marry princess margaret for your grace so in the famous ancient city tours in presence of the kings of france and sicil the dukes of orleance calaber britaigne and alanson seven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops i have performed my task and was espoused and humbly now upon my bended knee in sight of england and her lordly peers deliver up my title in the queen to your most gracious hands that are the substance of that great shadow i did represent the happiest gift that ever marquess gave the fairest queen that ever king received long live queen margaret england's happiness my lord protector so it please your grace here are the articles of contracted peace between our sovereign and the french king charles for eighteen months concluded by consent how now fellow wouldst anything with me thy wife too that's some wrong indeed  what's yours what's here against the duke of suffolk for enclosing the commons of melford how now sir knave who is there take this fellow in and send for his master with a pursuivant presently we'll hear more of your matter before the king madam be patient as i was cause your highness came to england so will i in england work your grace's full content and he of these that can do most of all cannot do more in england than the nevilles salisbury and warwick are no simple peers madam myself have limed a bush for her and placed a choir of such enticing birds that she will light to listen to the lays and never mount to trouble you again so let her rest and madam list to me for i am bold to counsel you in this although we fancy not the cardinal yet must we join with him and with the lords till we have brought duke humphrey in disgrace as for the duke of york this late complaint will make but little for his benefit so one by one we'll weed them all at last and you yourself shall steer the happy helm resign it then and leave thine insolence since thou wert king as who is king but thou  the commonwealth hath daily run to wrack the dauphin hath prevailed beyond the seas and all the peers and nobles of the realm have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty before we make election give me leave to show some reason of no little force that york is most unmeet of any man peace headstrong warwick because here is a man accused of treason pray god the duke of york excuse himself please it your majesty this is the man that doth accuse his master of high treason his words were these that richard duke of york was rightful heir unto the english crown and that your majesty was an usurper no marvel an it like your majesty my lord protector's hawks do tower so well they know their master loves to be aloft and bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch no malice sir no more than well becomes so good a quarrel and so bad a peer why as you my lord an 't like your lordly lord protectorship come to the king and tell him what miracle what woman is this how cam'st thou so and yet i think jet did he never see true made the lame to leap and fly away thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays thus eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days well hath your highness seen into this duke and had i first been put to speak my mind i think i should have told your grace's tale the duchess by his subornation upon my life began her devilish practices or if he were not privy to those faults yet by reputing of his high descent  as next the king he was successive heir and such high vaunts of his nobility  did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess by wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall smooth runs the water where the brook is deep and in his simple show he harbors treason the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb no no my sovereign gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon unless thou wert more loyal than thou art i do arrest thee of high treason here my lord these faults are easy quickly answered but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge whereof you cannot easily purge yourself i do arrest you in his highness' name and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep until your further time of trial hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominious words though clerkly couched as if she had subornèd some to swear false allegations to o'erthrow his state but in my mind that were no policy the king will labor still to save his life the commons haply rise to save his life and yet we have but trivial argument more than mistrust that shows him worthy death ah york no man alive so fain as i madam 'tis true and were 't not madness then to make the fox surveyor of the fold  who being accused a crafty murderer his guilt should be but idly posted over because his purpose is not executed no let him die in that he is a fox by nature proved an enemy to the flock before his chaps be stained with crimson blood as humphrey proved by reasons to my liege and do not stand on quillets how to slay him  be it by gins by snares by subtlety sleeping or waking 'tis no matter how so he be dead for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit not resolute except so much were done for things are often spoke and seldom meant but that my heart accordeth with my tongue seeing the deed is meritorious and to preserve my sovereign from his foe say but the word and i will be his priest here is my hand the deed is worthy doing why our authority is his consent and what we do establish he confirms then noble york take thou this task in hand a charge lord york that i will see performed but now return we to the false duke humphrey i'll see it truly done my lord of york now sirs have you dispatched this thing why that's well said go get you to my house i will reward you for this venturous deed the king and all the peers are here at hand have you laid fair the bed is all things well according as i gave directions away be gone i'll call him presently my noble lord dead in his bed my lord gloucester is dead he doth revive again madam be patient comfort my sovereign gracious henry comfort a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue what instance gives lord warwick for his vow why warwick who should do the duke to death myself and beaufort had him in protection and we i hope sir are no murderers i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men but here's a vengeful sword rusted with ease that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart that slanders me with murder's crimson badge  say if thou dar'st proud lord of warwickshire that i am faulty in duke humphrey's death blunt witted lord ignoble in demeanor if ever lady wronged her lord so much thy mother took into her blameful bed some stern untutored churl and noble stock was graft with crab tree slip whose fruit thou art and never of the nevilles' noble race thou shalt be waking while i shed thy blood if from this presence thou dar'st go with me the trait'rous warwick with the men of bury set all upon me mighty sovereign 'tis like the commons rude unpolished hinds could send such message to their sovereign but you my lord were glad to be employed to show how quaint an orator you are but all the honor salisbury hath won is that he was the lord ambassador sent from a sort of tinkers to the king cease gentle queen these execrations and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave a plague upon them wherefore should i curse them could curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan i would invent as bitter searching terms as curst as harsh and horrible to hear delivered strongly through my fixèd teeth with full as many signs of deadly hate as lean faced envy in her loathsome cave my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint mine hair be fixed on end as one distract ay every joint should seem to curse and ban and even now my burdened heart would break should i not curse them poison be their drink gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees their chiefest prospect murd'ring basilisks their softest touch as smart as lizards' stings their music frightful as the serpent's hiss and boding screech owls make the consort full all the foul terrors in dark seated hell  you bade me ban and will you bid me leave now by the ground that i am banished from well could i curse away a winter's night though standing naked on a mountain top where biting cold would never let grass grow and think it but a minute spent in sport thus is poor suffolk ten times banishèd once by the king and three times thrice by thee 'tis not the land i care for wert thou thence a wilderness is populous enough so suffolk had thy heavenly company for where thou art there is the world itself with every several pleasure in the world and where thou art not desolation i can no more live thou to joy thy life myself no joy in naught but that thou liv'st if i depart from thee i cannot live and in thy sight to die what were it else but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap here could i breathe my soul into the air as mild and gentle as the cradle babe dying with mother's dug between its lips where from thy sight i should be raging mad and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul or i should breathe it so into thy body and then it lived in sweet elysium to die by thee were but to die in jest from thee to die were torture more than death o let me stay befall what may befall i go a jewel locked into the woefull'st cask that ever did contain a thing of worth even as a splitted bark so sunder we this way fall i to death look on my george i am a gentleman rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid thy name affrights me in whose sound is death a cunning man did calculate my birth and told me that by water i should die yet let not this make thee be bloody minded thy name is gualtier being rightly sounded stay whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince the duke of suffolk william de la pole ay but these rags are no part of the duke jove sometimes went disguised and why not i obscure and lousy swain king henry's blood the honorable blood of lancaster must not be shed by such a jaded groom hast thou not kissed thy hand and held my stirrup bareheaded plodded by my footcloth mule and thought thee happy when i shook my head how often hast thou waited at my cup fed from my trencher kneeled down at the board when i have feasted with queen margaret remember it and let it make thee crestfall'n ay and allay this thy abortive pride how in our voiding lobby hast thou stood and duly waited for my coming forth this hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf and therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou thou dar'st not for thy own pole o that i were a god to shoot forth thunder upon these paltry servile abject drudges small things make base men proud this villain here being captain of a pinnace threatens more than bargulus the strong illyrian pirate drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives it is impossible that i should die by such a lowly vassal as thyself thy words move rage and not remorse in me i go of message from the queen to france i charge thee waft me safely cross the channel paene gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee i fear suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough used to command untaught to plead for favor far be it we should honor such as these with humble suit no rather let my head stoop to the block than these knees bow to any save to the god of heaven and to my king and sooner dance upon a bloody pole than stand uncovered to the vulgar groom true nobility is exempt from fear  more can i bear than you dare execute come soldiers show what cruelty you can that this my death may never be forgot great men oft die by vile bezonians a roman sworder and banditto slave murdered sweet tully brutus' bastard hand stabbed julius caesar savage islanders pompey the great and suffolk dies by pirates
