my lord you have my voice to 't the fault's bloody 'tis necessary he should die nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy now captain you undergo too strict a paradox striving to make an ugly deed look fair your words have took such pains as if they labored to bring manslaughter into form and set quarreling upon the head of valor which indeed is valor misbegot and came into the world when sects and factions were newly born he's truly valiant that can wisely suffer the worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs his outsides to wear them like his raiment carelessly and ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart to bring it into danger if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill what folly 'tis to hazard life for ill you cannot make gross sins look clear to revenge is no valor but to bear what's that he dies we are for law he dies urge it no more on height of our displeasure friend or brother he forfeits his own blood that spills another do you dare our anger 'tis in few words but spacious in effect we banish thee forever if after two days' shine athens contain thee attend our weightier judgment and not to swell our spirit he shall be executed presently
