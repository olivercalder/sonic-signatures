enough for a shift yea marry dost thou hear balthasar i pray thee get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we would have it at the lady hero's chamber window do so farewell come hither leonato what was it you told me of today that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick maybe she doth but counterfeit why what effects of passion shows she how how i pray you you amaze me i would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection hath she made her affection known to benedick it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it an he should it were an alms to hang him she's an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous in everything but in loving benedick i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what he will say she doth well if she should make tender of her love 'tis very possible he'll scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit he hath indeed a good outward happiness he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most christianlike fear and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while i love benedick well and i could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another's dotage and no such matter that's the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumb show let us send her to call him in to dinner i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go i toward aragon nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupid's bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks hang him truant there's no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love if he be sad he wants money draw it what sigh for the toothache there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a dutchman today a frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a german from the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is hath any man seen him at the barber's nay he rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that the greatest note of it is his melancholy yea or to paint himself for the which i hear what they say of him indeed that tells a heavy tale for him conclude conclude he is in love that would i know too i warrant one that knows him not she shall be buried with her face upwards for my life to break with him about beatrice good e'en brother in private what's the matter you know he does why what's the matter i will not think it and as i wooed for thee to obtain her i will join with thee to disgrace her o day untowardly turned nothing unless you render her again what should i speak i stand dishonored that have gone about to link my dear friend to a common stale why then are you no maiden leonato i am sorry you must hear upon mine honor myself my brother and this griev√®d count did see her hear her at that hour last night talk with a ruffian at her chamber window who hath indeed most like a liberal villain confessed the vile encounters they have had a thousand times in secret good e'en good e'en we have some haste leonato nay do not quarrel with us good old man you say not right old man gentlemen both we will not wake your patience my heart is sorry for your daughter's death but on my honor she was charged with nothing but what was true and very full of proof i will not hear you see see here comes the man we went to seek welcome signior you are almost come to part almost a fray leonato and his brother what think'st thou had we fought i doubt we should have been too young for them dost thou wear thy wit by thy side as i am an honest man he looks pale art thou sick or angry by this light he changes more and more i think he be angry indeed what a feast a feast i'll tell thee how beatrice praised thy wit the other day i said thou hadst a fine wit true said she a fine little one no said i a great wit right says she a great gross one nay said i a good wit just said she it hurts nobody nay said i the gentleman is wise certain said she a wise gentleman nay said i he hath the tongues that i believe said she for he swore a thing to me on monday night which he forswore on tuesday morning there's a double tongue there's two tongues thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues yet at last she concluded with a sigh thou wast the proper'st man in italy yea that she did but yet for all that an if she did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly the old man's daughter told us all but when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible benedick's head he is in earnest and hath challenged thee what a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit but soft you let me be pluck up my heart and be sad did he not say my brother was fled how now two of my brother's men bound borachio one officers what offense have these men done first i ask thee what they have done thirdly i ask thee what's their offense sixth and lastly why they are committed and to conclude what you lay to their charge who have you offended masters that you are thus bound to your answer this learned constable is too cunning to be understood what's your offense runs not this speech like iron through your blood but did my brother set thee on to this he is composed and framed of treachery and fled he is upon this villainy by my soul nor i and yet to satisfy this good old man i would bend under any heavy weight that he'll enjoin me to we will not fail good morrow masters put your torches out the wolves have preyed and look the gentle day before the wheels of phoebus round about dapples the drowsy east with spots of gray thanks to you all and leave us fare you well come let us hence and put on other weeds and then to leonato's we will go good morrow to this fair assembly good morrow benedick why what's the matter that you have such a february face so full of frost of storm and cloudiness the former hero hero that is dead how dost thou benedick the married man
