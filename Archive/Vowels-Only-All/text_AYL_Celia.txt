she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very ill favoredly no when nature hath made a fair creature may she not by fortune fall into the fire though nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument peradventure this is not fortune's work neither but nature's who perceiveth our natural wits too dull

some how brief the life of man runs his erring pilgrimage that the stretching of a span buckles in his sum of age some of violated vows 'twixt the souls of friend and friend but upon the fairest boughs or at every sentence' end will i rosalinda write teaching all that read to know the quintessence of every sprite heaven would in little show therefore heaven nature charged that one body should be filled with all graces wide enlarged nature presently distilled helen's cheek but not her heart cleopatra's majesty atalanta's better part sad lucretia's modesty thus rosalind of many parts by heavenly synod was devised of many faces eyes and hearts to have the touches dearest prized heaven would that she these gifts should have and i to live and die her slave how now back friends shepherd go off a little go with him sirrah didst thou hear these verses that's no matter the feet might bear the verses but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees trow you who hath done this and a chain that you once wore about his neck change you color o lord lord it is a hard matter for friends to meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter is it possible o wonderful wonderful and most wonderful wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that out of all whooping so you may put a man in your belly nay he hath but a little beard it is young orlando that tripped up the wrestler's heels and your heart both in an instant i' faith coz 'tis he orlando you must borrow me gargantua's mouth first 'tis a word too great for any mouth of this age's size to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover but take a taste of my finding him and relish it with good observance i found him under a tree like a dropped acorn give me audience good madam there lay he stretched along like a wounded knight cry holla to thy tongue i prithee it curvets unseasonably he was furnished like a hunter i would sing my song without a burden thou bring'st me out of tune you bring me out soft comes he not here do i prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man as good cause as one would desire therefore weep something browner than judas's marry his kisses are judas's own children an excellent color your chestnut was ever the only color he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them nay certainly there is no truth in him yes i think he is not a pickpurse nor a horse stealer but for his verity in love i do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm eaten nut yes when he is in but i think he is not in was is not is besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmer of false reckonings he attends here in the forest on the duke your father o that's a brave man he writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose but all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides who comes here well and what of him it pleases him to call you so but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you i cannot say the words go to will you orlando have to wife this rosalind you have simply misused our sex in your love prate we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs out and i'll sleep i warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep look who comes here alas poor shepherd west of this place down in the neighbor bottom the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream left on your right hand brings you to the place but at this hour the house doth keep itself there's none within it is no boast being asked to say we are i pray you tell it o i have heard him speak of that same brother and he did render him the most unnatural that lived amongst men are you his brother was 't you that did so oft contrive to kill him why how now ganymede sweet ganymede there is more in it cousin ganymede
