distance my duty to you your unfortunate son bertram this is not well rash and unbridled boy to fly the favors of so good a king to pluck his indignation on thy head by the misprizing of a maid too virtuous for the contempt of empire what is the matter why should he be killed think upon patience pray you gentlemen i have felt so many quirks of joy and grief that the first face of neither on the start can woman me unto 't where is my son i pray you brought you this letter gentlemen i prithee lady have a better cheer if thou engrossest all the griefs are thine thou robb'st me of a moiety he

there's nothing here that is too good for him but only she and she deserves a lord that twenty such rude boys might tend upon and call her hourly mistress who was with him parolles was it not a very tainted fellow and full of wickedness my son corrupts a well derivèd nature with his inducement you're welcome gentlemen i will entreat you when you see my son to tell him that his sword can never win the honor that he loses more i'll entreat you written to bear along not so but as we change our courtesies will you draw near alas and would you take the letter of her might you not know she would do as she has done by sending me a letter read it again ah what sharp stings are in her mildest words rinaldo you did never lack advice so much as letting her pass so had i spoke with her i could have well diverted her intents which thus she hath prevented what angel shall bless this unworthy husband he cannot thrive unless her prayers whom heaven delights to hear and loves to grant reprieve him from the wrath of greatest justice write write rinaldo to this unworthy husband of his wife let every word weigh heavy of her worth that he does weigh too light my greatest grief though little he do feel it set down sharply dispatch the most convenient messenger when haply he shall hear that she is gone he will return and hope i may that she hearing so much will speed her foot again led hither by pure love which of them both is dearest to me i have no skill in sense to make distinction provide this messenger my heart is heavy and mine age is weak grief would have tears and sorrow bids me speak i would i had not known him it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating if she had partaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother i could not have owed her a more rooted love so he is my lord that's gone made himself much sport out of him by his authority he remains here which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness and indeed he has no pace but runs where he will with very much content my lord and i wish it happily effected it rejoices me that i hope i shall see him ere i die i have letters that my son will be here tonight i shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together you need but plead your honorable privilege 'tis past my liege and i beseech your majesty to make it natural rebellion done i' th' blade of youth when oil and fire too strong for reason's force o'erbears it and burns on which better than the first o dear heaven bless or ere they meet in me o nature cesse son on my life i have seen her wear it and she reckoned it at her life's rate now justice on the doers he blushes and 'tis hit of six preceding ancestors that gem conferred by testament to th' sequent issue hath it been
