take advantage of the field ha majesty how high thy glory towers when the rich blood of kings is set on fire o now doth death line his dead chaps with steel the swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs and now he feasts mousing the flesh of men in undetermined differences of kings why stand these royal fronts amazèd thus cry havoc kings back to the stainèd field you equal potents fiery kindled spirits then let confusion of one part confirm the other's peace till then blows blood and death by heaven these scroyles of angiers flout you kings and stand securely on their battlements as in a theater whence they gape and point at your industrious scenes and acts of death your royal presences be ruled by me do like the mutines of jerusalem be friends awhile and both conjointly bend your sharpest deeds of malice on this town by east and west let france and england mount their battering cannon chargèd to the mouths till their soul fearing clamors have brawled down the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city i'd play incessantly upon these jades even till unfencèd desolation leave them as naked as the vulgar air that done dissever your united strengths and part your mingled colors once again turn face to face and bloody point to point then in a moment fortune shall cull forth out of one side her happy minion to whom in favor she shall give the day and kiss him with a glorious victory how like you this wild counsel mighty states smacks it not something of the policy an if thou hast the mettle of a king being wronged as we are by this peevish town turn thou the mouth of thy artillery as we will ours against these saucy walls and when that we have dashed them to the ground why then defy each other and pell mell make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell o prudent discipline from north to south austria and france shoot in each other's mouth i'll stir them to it come away away here's a stay that shakes the rotten carcass of old death out of his rags here's a large mouth indeed that spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas talks as familiarly of roaring lions as maids of thirteen do of puppy dogs what cannoneer begot this lusty blood he speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce he gives the bastinado with his tongue our ears are cudgeled not a word of his but buffets better than a fist of france zounds i was never so bethumped with words since i first called my brother's father dad drawn in the flattering table of her eye hanged in the frowning wrinkle of her brow and quartered in her heart he doth espy himself love's traitor this is pity now that hanged and drawn and quartered there should be in such a love so vile a lout as he mad world mad kings mad composition john to stop arthur's title in the whole hath willingly departed with a part and france whose armor conscience buckled on whom zeal and charity brought to the field as god's own soldier rounded in the ear with that same purpose changer that sly devil that broker that still breaks the pate of faith that daily break vow he that wins of all of kings of beggars old men young men maids  who having no external thing to lose but the word maid cheats the poor maid of that  that smooth faced gentleman tickling commodity commodity the bias of the world  the world who of itself is peisèd well made to run even upon even ground till this advantage this vile drawing bias this sway of motion this commodity makes it take head from all indifferency from all direction purpose course intent and this same bias this commodity this bawd this broker this all changing word clapped on the outward eye of fickle france hath drawn him from his own determined aid from a resolved and honorable war to a most base and vile concluded peace and why rail i on this commodity but for because he hath not wooed me yet not that i have the power to clutch my hand when his fair angels would salute my palm but for my hand as unattempted yet like a poor beggar raileth on the rich well whiles i am a beggar i will rail and say there is no sin but to be rich and being rich my virtue then shall be to say there is no vice but beggary since kings break faith upon commodity gain be my lord for i will worship thee and hang a calfskin on those recreant limbs and hang a calfskin on those recreant limbs and hang a calfskin on his recreant limbs your breeches best may carry them hang nothing but a calfskin most sweet lout will 't not be will not a calfskin stop that mouth of thine old time the clock setter that bald sexton time is it as he will well then france shall rue now by my life this day grows wondrous hot some airy devil hovers in the sky and pours down mischief austria's head lie there while philip breathes my lord i rescued her her highness is in safety fear you not but on my liege for very little pains will bring this labor to an happy end bell book and candle shall not drive me back when gold and silver becks me to come on i leave your highness grandam i will pray if ever i remember to be holy for your fair safety so i kiss your hand but if you be afeard to hear the worst then let the worst unheard fall on your head how i have sped among the clergymen the sums i have collected shall express but as i traveled hither through the land i find the people strangely fantasied possessed with rumors full of idle dreams not knowing what they fear but full of fear and here's a prophet that i brought with me from forth the streets of pomfret whom i found with many hundreds treading on his heels to whom he sung in rude harsh sounding rhymes that ere the next ascension day at noon your highness should deliver up your crown the french my lord men's mouths are full of it besides i met lord bigot and lord salisbury with eyes as red as new enkindled fire and others more going to seek the grave of arthur whom they say is killed tonight on your suggestion i will seek them out the spirit of the time shall teach me speed once more today well met distempered lords the king by me requests your presence straight whate'er you think good words i think were best but there is little reason in your grief therefore 'twere reason you had manners now 'tis true to hurt his master no man's else it is a damnèd and a bloody work the graceless action of a heavy hand if that it be the work of any hand your sword is bright sir put it up again keep the peace i say thou wert better gall the devil salisbury if thou but frown on me or stir thy foot or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame i'll strike thee dead put up thy sword betime or i'll so maul you and your toasting iron that you shall think the devil is come from hell here's a good world knew you of this fair work beyond the infinite and boundless reach of mercy if thou didst this deed of death art thou damned hubert ha i'll tell thee what thou 'rt damned as black nay nothing is so black  thou art more deep damned than prince lucifer there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell as thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child if thou didst but consent to this most cruel act do but despair and if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread that ever spider twisted from her womb will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself put but a little water in a spoon and it shall be as all the ocean enough to stifle such a villain up i do suspect thee very grievously go bear him in thine arms i am amazed methinks and lose my way among the thorns and dangers of this world how easy dost thou take all england up from forth this morsel of dead royalty the life the right and truth of all this realm is fled to heaven and england now is left to tug and scamble and to part by th' teeth the unowed interest of proud swelling state now for the bare picked bone of majesty doth doggèd war bristle his angry crest and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace now powers from home and discontents at home meet in one line and vast confusion waits as doth a raven on a sick fall'n beast the imminent decay of wrested pomp now happy he whose cloak and cincture can hold out this tempest bear away that child and follow me with speed i'll to the king a thousand businesses are brief in hand and heaven itself doth frown upon the land all kent hath yielded nothing there holds out but dover castle london hath received like a kind host the dauphin and his powers your nobles will not hear you but are gone to offer service to your enemy and wild amazement hurries up and down the little number of your doubtful friends they found him dead and cast into the streets an empty casket where the jewel of life by some damned hand was robbed and ta'en away so on my soul he did for aught he knew but wherefore do you droop why look you sad be great in act as you have been in thought let not the world see fear and sad distrust govern the motion of a kingly eye be stirring as the time be fire with fire threaten the threat'ner and outface the brow of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes that borrow their behaviors from the great grow great by your example and put on the dauntless spirit of resolution away and glister like the god of war when he intendeth to become the field show boldness and aspiring confidence what shall they seek the lion in his den and fright him there and make him tremble there o let it not be said forage and run to meet displeasure farther from the doors and grapple with him ere he come so nigh o inglorious league shall we upon the footing of our land send fair play orders and make compromise insinuation parley and base truce to arms invasive shall a beardless boy a cockered silken wanton brave our fields and flesh his spirit in a warlike soil mocking the air with colors idly spread and find no check let us my liege to arms perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace or if he do let it at least be said they saw we had a purpose of defense away then with good courage yet i know our party may well meet a prouder foe according to the fair play of the world let me have audience i am sent to speak my holy lord of milan from the king i come to learn how you have dealt for him and as you answer i do know the scope and warrant limited unto my tongue by all the blood that ever fury breathed the youth says well now hear our english king for thus his royalty doth speak in me he is prepared and reason too he should this apish and unmannerly approach this harnessed masque and unadvisèd revel this unheard sauciness and boyish troops the king doth smile at and is well prepared to whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms from out the circle of his territories that hand which had the strength even at your door to cudgel you and make you take the hatch to dive like buckets in concealèd wells to crouch in litter of your stable planks to lie like pawns locked up in chests and trunks to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake even at the crying of your nation's crow thinking this voice an armèd englishman  shall that victorious hand be feebled here that in your chambers gave you chastisement no know the gallant monarch is in arms and like an eagle o'er his aerie towers to souse annoyance that comes near his nest  and you degenerate you ingrate revolts you bloody neroes ripping up the womb of your dear mother england blush for shame for your own ladies and pale visaged maids like amazons come tripping after drums their thimbles into armèd gauntlets change their needles to lances and their gentle hearts to fierce and bloody inclination no i will speak indeed your drums being beaten will cry out and so shall you being beaten do but start an echo with the clamor of thy drum and even at hand a drum is ready braced that shall reverberate all as loud as thine sound but another and another shall as loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear and mock the deep mouthed thunder for at hand not trusting to this halting legate here whom he hath used rather for sport than need is warlike john and in his forehead sits a bare ribbed death whose office is this day to feast upon whole thousands of the french and thou shalt find it dauphin do not doubt a friend what art thou whither dost thou go why may not i demand of thine affairs as well as thou of mine hubert i think who thou wilt an if thou please thou mayst befriend me so much as to think i come one way of the plantagenets come come sans compliment what news abroad brief then and what's the news show me the very wound of this ill news i am no woman i'll not swoon at it how did he take it who did taste to him who didst thou leave to tend his majesty withhold thine indignation mighty god and tempt us not to bear above our power i'll tell thee hubert half my power this night passing these flats are taken by the tide these lincoln washes have devourèd them myself well mounted hardly have escaped away before conduct me to the king i doubt he will be dead or ere i come o i am scalded with my violent motion and spleen of speed to see your majesty the dauphin is preparing hitherward where god he knows how we shall answer him for in a night the best part of my power as i upon advantage did remove were in the washes all unwarily devourèd by the unexpected flood art thou gone so i do but stay behind to do the office for thee of revenge and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven as it on earth hath been thy servant still  now now you stars that move in your right spheres where be your powers show now your mended faiths and instantly return with me again to push destruction and perpetual shame out of the weak door of our fainting land straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought the dauphin rages at our very heels he will the rather do it when he sees ourselves well sinewèd to our defense let it be so and you my noble prince with other princes that may best be spared shall wait upon your father's funeral thither shall it then and happily may your sweet self put on the lineal state and glory of the land to whom with all submission on my knee i do bequeath my faithful services and true subjection everlastingly o let us pay the time but needful woe since it hath been beforehand with our griefs this england never did nor never shall lie at the proud foot of a conqueror but when it first did help to wound itself now these her princes are come home again come the three corners of the world in arms and we shall shock them naught shall make us rue if england to itself do rest but true
