many years of happy days befall my gracious sovereign my most loving liege first heaven be the record to my speech  in the devotion of a subject's love tend'ring the precious safety of my prince and free from other misbegotten hate come i appellant to this princely presence  now thomas mowbray do i turn to thee and mark my greeting well for what i speak my body shall make good upon this earth or my divine soul answer it in heaven thou art a traitor and a miscreant too good to be so and too bad to live since the more fair and crystal is the sky the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly once more the more to aggravate the note with a foul traitor's name stuff i thy throat and wish so please my sovereign ere i move what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove pale trembling coward there i throw my gage disclaiming here the kindred of the king and lay aside my high blood's royalty which fear not reverence makes thee to except if guilty dread have left thee so much strength as to take up mine honor's pawn then stoop by that and all the rites of knighthood else will i make good against thee arm to arm what i have spoke or thou canst worse devise look what i speak my life shall prove it true that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles in name of lendings for your highness' soldiers the which he hath detained for lewd employments like a false traitor and injurious villain besides i say and will in battle prove or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge that ever was surveyed by english eye that all the treasons for these eighteen years complotted and contrivèd in this land fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring further i say and further will maintain upon his bad life to make all this good that he did plot the duke of gloucester's death suggest his soon believing adversaries and consequently like a traitor coward sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood which blood like sacrificing abel's cries even from the tongueless caverns of the earth to me for justice and rough chastisement and by the glorious worth of my descent this arm shall do it or this life be spent o god defend my soul from such deep sin shall i seem crestfallen in my father's sight or with pale beggar fear impeach my height before this out dared dastard ere my tongue shall wound my honor with such feeble wrong or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear the slavish motive of recanting fear and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace where shame doth harbor even in mowbray's face harry of hereford lancaster and derby am i who ready here do stand in arms to prove by god's grace and my body's valor in lists on thomas mowbray duke of norfolk that he is a traitor foul and dangerous to god of heaven king richard and to me and as i truly fight defend me heaven lord marshal let me kiss my sovereign's hand and bow my knee before his majesty for mowbray and myself are like two men that vow a long and weary pilgrimage then let us take a ceremonious leave and loving farewell of our several friends o let no noble eye profane a tear for me if i be gored with mowbray's spear as confident as is the falcon's flight against a bird do i with mowbray fight my loving lord i take my leave of you  of you my noble cousin lord aumerle not sick although i have to do with death but lusty young and cheerly drawing breath  lo as at english feasts so i regreet the daintiest last to make the end most sweet o thou the earthly author of my blood whose youthful spirit in me regenerate doth with a twofold vigor lift me up to reach at victory above my head add proof unto mine armor with thy prayers and with thy blessings steel my lance's point that it may enter mowbray's waxen coat and furbish new the name of john o' gaunt even in the lusty havior of his son mine innocence and saint george to thrive strong as a tower in hope i cry amen your will be done this must my comfort be that sun that warms you here shall shine on me and those his golden beams to you here lent shall point on me and gild my banishment i swear norfolk so far as to mine enemy by this time had the king permitted us one of our souls had wandered in the air banished this frail sepulcher of our flesh as now our flesh is banished from this land confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm since thou hast far to go bear not along the clogging burden of a guilty soul how long a time lies in one little word four lagging winters and four wanton springs end in a word such is the breath of kings i have too few to take my leave of you when the tongue's office should be prodigal to breathe the abundant dolor of the heart joy absent grief is present for that time to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten my heart will sigh when i miscall it so which finds it an enforcèd pilgrimage nay rather every tedious stride i make will but remember me what a deal of world i wander from the jewels that i love must i not serve a long apprenticehood to foreign passages and in the end having my freedom boast of nothing else but that i was a journeyman to grief o who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking on the frosty caucasus or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast or wallow naked in december snow by thinking on fantastic summer's heat o no the apprehension of the good gives but the greater feeling to the worse fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more than when he bites but lanceth not the sore then england's ground farewell sweet soil adieu my mother and my nurse that bears me yet where'er i wander boast of this i can though banished yet a trueborn englishman how far is it my lord to berkeley now of much less value is my company than your good words but who comes here i thank thee gentle percy and be sure i count myself in nothing else so happy as in a soul rememb'ring my good friends and as my fortune ripens with thy love it shall be still thy true love's recompense my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it welcome my lords i wot your love pursues a banished traitor all my treasury is yet but unfelt thanks which more enriched shall be your love and labor's recompense evermore thank's the exchequer of the poor which till my infant fortune comes to years stands for my bounty but who comes here my lord my answer is to lancaster and i am come to seek that name in england and i must find that title in your tongue before i make reply to aught you say i shall not need transport my words by you here comes his grace in person my noble uncle my gracious uncle  my gracious uncle let me know my fault on what condition stands it and wherein as i was banished i was banished hereford but as i come i come for lancaster and noble uncle i beseech your grace look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye you are my father for methinks in you i see old gaunt alive o then my father will you permit that i shall stand condemned a wandering vagabond my rights and royalties plucked from my arms perforce and given away

trod down he should have found his uncle gaunt a father to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay i am denied to sue my livery here and yet my letters patents give me leave my father's goods are all distrained and sold and these and all are all amiss employed what would you have me do i am a subject and i challenge law attorneys are denied me and therefore personally i lay my claim to my inheritance of free descent an offer uncle that we will accept but we must win your grace to go with us to bristow castle which they say is held by bushy bagot and their complices the caterpillars of the commonwealth which i have sworn to weed and pluck away bring forth these men  bushy and green i will not vex your souls since presently your souls must part your bodies with too much urging your pernicious lives for 'twere no charity yet to wash your blood from off my hands here in the view of men i will unfold some causes of your deaths you have misled a prince a royal king a happy gentleman

carpet of this plain let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum that from this castle's tottered battlements our fair appointments may be well perused methinks king richard and myself should
