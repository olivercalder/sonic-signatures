by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world good sentences and well pronounced if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor men's cottages princes' palaces it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband o me the word choose i may neither choose who i would nor refuse who i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father is it not hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none i pray thee overname them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection ay that's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith he doth nothing but frown as who should say an you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be married to a death's head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these god defend me from these two god made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the neapolitan's a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a cap'ring he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english he is a proper man's picture but alas who can converse with a dumb show how oddly he is suited i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behavior everywhere that he hath a neighborly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast an the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it i will do anything nerissa ere i will be married to a sponge if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my father's will i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant them a fair departure yes yes it was bassanio as i think so was he called i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise how now what news if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me come nerissa sirrah go before  whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the door in terms of choice i am not solely led by nice direction of a maiden's eyes besides the lott'ry of my destiny bars me the right of voluntary choosing but if my father had not scanted me and hedged me by his wit to yield myself his wife who wins me by that means i told you yourself renownèd prince then stood as fair as any comer i have looked on yet for my affection you must take your chance and either not attempt to choose at all or swear before you choose if you choose wrong never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage therefore be advised first forward to the temple after dinner your hazard shall be made go draw aside the curtains and discover the several caskets to this noble prince now make your choice the one of them contains my picture prince if you choose that then i am yours withal there take it prince and if my form lie there then i am yours a gentle riddance draw the curtains go let all of his complexion choose me so behold there stand the caskets noble prince if you choose that wherein i am contained straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized but if you fail without more speech my lord you must be gone from hence immediately to these injunctions everyone doth swear that comes to hazard for my worthless self too long a pause for that which you find there to offend and judge are distinct offices and of opposèd natures thus hath the candle singed the moth o these deliberate fools when they do choose they have the wisdom by their wit to lose come draw the curtain nerissa here what would my lord no more i pray thee i am half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee thou spend'st such high day wit in praising him come come nerissa for i long to see quick cupid's post that comes so mannerly i pray you tarry pause a day or two before you hazard for in choosing wrong i lose your company therefore forbear a while there's something tells me but it is not love i would not lose you and you know yourself hate counsels not in such a quality but lest you should not understand me well and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought i would detain you here some month or two before you venture for me i could teach you how to choose right but then i am forsworn so will i never be so may you miss me but if you do you'll make me wish a sin that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes they have o'erlooked me and divided me one half of me is yours the other half yours  mine own i would say but if mine then yours and so all yours o these naughty times puts bars between the owners and their rights and so though yours not yours prove it so let fortune go to hell for it not i i speak too long but 'tis to peize the time to eche it and to draw it out in length to stay you from election upon the rack bassanio then confess what treason there is mingled with your love ay but i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforcèd do speak anything well then confess and live away then i am locked in one of them if you do love me you will find me out  nerissa and the rest stand all aloof let music sound while he doth make his choice then if he lose he makes a swanlike end fading in music that the comparison may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream and wat'ry deathbed for him he may win and what is music then then music is even as the flourish when true subjects bow to a new crownèd monarch such it is as are those dulcet sounds in break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear and summon him to marriage now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the sea monster i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives with blearèd visages come forth to view the issue of th' exploit go hercules live thou i live with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that mak'st the fray how all the other passions fleet to air as doubtful thoughts and rash embraced despair and shudd'ring fear and green eyed jealousy o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rain thy joy scant this excess i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit you see me lord bassanio where i stand such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich that only to stand high in your account i might in virtues beauties livings friends exceed account but the full sum of me is sum of something which to term in gross is an unlessoned girl unschooled unpracticed happy in this she is not yet so old but she may learn happier than this she is not bred so dull but she can learn happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord her governor her king myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted but now i was the lord of this fair mansion master of my servants queen o'er myself and even now but now this house these servants and this same myself are yours my lord's i give them with this ring which when you part from lose or give away let it presage the ruin of your love and be my vantage to exclaim on you is this true nerissa so do i my lord they are entirely welcome there are some shrewd contents in yond same paper that steals the color from bassanio's cheek some dear friend dead else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man what worse and worse  with leave bassanio i am half yourself and i must freely have the half of anything that this same paper brings you is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble what sum owes he the jew what no more pay him six thousand and deface the bond double six thousand and then treble that before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through bassanio's fault first go with me to church and call me wife and then away to venice to your friend for never shall you lie by portia's side with an unquiet soul you shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over when it is paid bring your true friend along my maid nerissa and myself meantime will live as maids and widows come away for you shall hence upon your wedding day bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer since you are dear bought i will love you dear but let me hear the letter of your friend o love dispatch all business and begone i never did repent for doing good nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this antonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord if it be so how little is the cost i have bestowed in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish cruelty this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it hear other things lorenzo i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lord's return for mine own part i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by nerissa here until her husband and my lord's return there is a monastery two miles off and there we will abide i do desire you not to deny this imposition the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you my people do already know my mind and will acknowledge you and jessica in place of lord bassanio and myself so fare you well till we shall meet again i thank you for your wish and am well pleased to wish it back on you fare you well jessica now balthazar as i have ever found thee honest true so let me find thee still take this same letter and use thou all th' endeavor of a man in speed to padua see thou render this into my cousin's hands doctor bellario and look what notes and garments he doth give thee bring them i pray thee with imagined speed unto the traject to the common ferry which trades to venice waste no time in words but get thee gone i shall be there before thee come on nerissa i have work in hand that you yet know not of we'll see our husbands before they think of us they shall nerissa but in such a habit that they shall think we are accomplishèd with that we lack i'll hold thee any wager when we are both accoutered like young men i'll prove the prettier fellow of the two and wear my dagger with the braver grace and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honorable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died  i could not do withal then i'll repent and wish for all that that i had not killed them and twenty of these puny lies i'll tell that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practice fie what a question's that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter but come i'll tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach which stays for us at the park gate and therefore haste away for we must measure twenty miles today i did my lord i am informèd throughly of the cause which is the merchant here and which the jew is your name shylock of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law cannot impugn you as you do proceed you stand within his danger do you not do you confess the bond then must the jew be merciful the quality of mercy is not strained it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes 'tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the thronèd monarch better than his crown his scepter shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptered sway it is enthronèd in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest god's when mercy seasons justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there is he not able to discharge the money it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree establishèd 'twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it cannot be i pray you let me look upon the bond shylock there's thrice thy money offered thee why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchant's heart be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife  for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond therefore lay bare your bosom  it is so are there balance here to weigh the flesh have by some surgeon shylock on your charge to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death it is not so expressed but what of that 'twere good you do so much for charity you merchant have you anything to say your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer a pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine the court awards it and the law doth give it and you must cut this flesh from off his breast the law allows it and the court awards it tarry a little there is something else this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood the words expressly are a pound of flesh take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice confiscate unto the state of venice thyself shalt see the act for as thou urgest justice be assured thou shalt have justice more than thou desir'st soft the jew shall have all justice soft no haste he shall have nothing but the penalty therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh if thou tak'st more or less than a just pound be it but so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate why doth the jew pause take thy forfeiture he hath refused it in the open court he shall have merely justice and his bond thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture to be so taken at thy peril jew tarry jew the law hath yet another hold on you it is enacted in the laws of venice if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen the party 'gainst the which he doth contrive shall seize one half his goods the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state and the offender's life lies in the mercy of the duke only 'gainst all other voice in which predicament i say thou stand'st for it appears by manifest proceeding that indirectly and directly too thou hast contrived against the very life of the defendant and thou hast incurred the danger formerly by me rehearsed down therefore and beg mercy of the duke ay for the state not for antonio what mercy can you render him antonio art thou contented jew what dost thou say clerk draw a deed of gift i humbly do desire your grace of pardon i must away this night toward padua and it is meet i presently set forth he is well paid that is well satisfied and i delivering you am satisfied and therein do account myself well paid my mind was never yet more mercenary i pray you know me when we meet again i wish you well and so i take my leave you press me far and therefore i will yield give me your gloves i'll wear them for your sake  and for your love i'll take this ring from you do not draw back your hand i'll take no more and you in love shall not deny me this i will have nothing else but only this and now methinks i have a mind to it i see sir you are liberal in offers you taught me first to beg and now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answered that 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts and if your wife be not a madwoman and know how well i have deserved this ring she would not hold out enemy forever for giving it to me well peace be with you inquire the jew's house out give him this deed and let him sign it we'll away tonight and be a day before our husbands home this deed will be well welcome to lorenzo that cannot be his ring i do accept most thankfully and so i pray you tell him furthermore i pray you show my youth old shylock's house thou mayst i warrant we shall have old swearing that they did give the rings away to men but we'll outface them and outswear them too  away make haste thou know'st where i will tarry that light we see is burning in my hall how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world so doth the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king until a king be by and then his state empties itself as doth an inland brook into the main of waters music hark nothing is good i see without respect methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren how many things by season seasoned are to their right praise and true perfection peace how the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awaked he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo by the bad voice we have been praying for our husbands' welfare which speed we hope the better for our words are they returned go in nerissa give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence  nor you lorenzo jessica nor you this night methinks is but the daylight sick it looks a little paler 'tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid let me give light but let me not be light for a light wife doth make a heavy husband and never be bassanio so for me but god sort all you are welcome home my lord you should in all sense be much bound to him for as i hear he was much bound for you sir you are very welcome to our house it must appear in other ways than words therefore i scant this breathing courtesy a quarrel ho already what's the matter you were to blame i must be plain with you to part so slightly with your wife's first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it and here he stands i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters now in faith gratiano you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief an 'twere to me i should be mad at it what ring gave you my lord not that i hope which you received of me even so void is your false heart of truth by heaven i will ne'er come in your bed until i see the ring if you had known the virtue of the ring or half her worthiness that gave the ring or your own honor to contain the ring you would not then have parted with the ring what man is there so much unreasonable if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony nerissa teaches me what to believe i'll die for 't but some woman had the ring let not that doctor e'er come near my house since he hath got the jewel that i loved and that which you did swear to keep for me i will become as liberal as you i'll not deny him anything i have no not my body nor my husband's bed know him i shall i am well sure of it lie not a night from home watch me like argus if you do not if i be left alone now by mine honor which is yet mine own i'll have that doctor for my bedfellow sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding mark you but that in both my eyes he doubly sees himself in each eye one swear by your double self and there's an oath of credit then you shall be his surety give him this and bid him keep it better than the other i had it of him pardon me bassanio for by this ring the doctor lay with me speak not so grossly you are all amazed here is a letter read it at your leisure it comes from padua from bellario there you shall find that portia was the doctor nerissa there her clerk lorenzo here shall witness i set forth as soon as you and even but now returned i have not yet entered my house antonio you are welcome and i have better news in store for you than you expect unseal this letter soon there you shall find three of your argosies are richly come to harbor suddenly you shall not know by what strange accident i chancèd on this letter how now lorenzo my clerk hath some good comforts too for you it is almost morning and yet i am sure you are not satisfied of these events at full let us go in and charge us there upon inter'gatories and we will answer all things faithfully
