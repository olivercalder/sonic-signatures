we will my noble lord i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs what shall i stab him as he sleeps why he shall never wake until the great judgment day the urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in me not to kill him having a warrant but to be damned for killing him from the which no warrant can defend me so i am to let him live nay i prithee stay a little i hope this passionate humor of mine will change it was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me zounds he dies i had forgot the reward o in the duke of gloucester's purse 'tis no matter let it go there's few or none will entertain it i'll not meddle with it it makes a man a coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his neighbor's wife but it detects him 'tis a blushing shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom it fills a man full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance i found it beggars any man that keeps it it is turned out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavors to trust to himself and live without it take the devil in thy mind and believe him not he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation come shall we fall to work o excellent device and make a sop of him strike you shall have wine enough my lord anon to to to  ay ay never my lord therefore prepare to die and he that hath commanded is our king and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee for false forswearing and for murder too thou didst receive the sacrament to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend you are deceived your brother gloucester hates you make peace with god for you must die my lord what shall we do look behind you my lord a bloody deed and desperately dispatched how fain like pilate would i wash my hands of this most grievous murder i would he knew that i had saved his brother take thou the fee and tell him what i say for i repent me that the duke is slain
