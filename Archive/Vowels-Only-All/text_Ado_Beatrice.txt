i pray you is signior mountanto returned from the wars or no he set up his bills here in messina and challenged cupid at the flight and my uncle's fool reading the challenge subscribed for cupid and challenged him at the bird bolt i pray you how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars but how many hath he killed for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffing well we are all mortal alas he gets nothing by that in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature who is his companion now he hath every month a new sworn brother very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block no an he were i would burn my study but i pray you who is his companion is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad god help the noble claudio if he have caught the benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured do good friend no not till a hot january i wonder that you will still be talking signior benedick nobody marks you is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as signior benedick courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor i thank god and my cold blood i am of your humor for that i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me scratching could not make it worse an 'twere such a face as yours were a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours you always end with a jade's trick i know you of old how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see him but i am heartburned an hour after he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my lady's eldest son evermore tattling with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if he could get her goodwill too curst is more than curst i shall lessen god's sending that way for it is said god sends a curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none just if he send me no husband for the which blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and evening lord i could not endure a husband with a beard on his face i had rather lie in the woolen what should i do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man i am not for him therefore i will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd and lead his apes into hell no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say get you to heaven beatrice get you to heaven here's no place for you maids so deliver i up my apes and away to saint peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long yes faith it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy and say father as it please you but yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another curtsy and say father as it please me not till god make men of some other metal than earth would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl no uncle i'll none adam's sons are my brethren and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is measure in everything and so dance out the answer for hear me hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig a measure and a cinquepace the first suit is hot and hasty like a scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerly modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight will you not tell me who told you so nor will you not tell me who you are that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of the hundred merry tales well this was signior benedick that said so i am sure you know him well enough did he never make you laugh why he is the prince's jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villainy for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in the fleeti would he had boarded me do do he'll but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then there's a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night we must follow the leaders nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at the next turning indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave him use for it a double heart for his single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say i have lost it so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove the mother of fools i have brought count claudio whom you sent me to seek the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion speak count 'tis your cue speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart good lord for alliance thus goes everyone to the world but i and i am sunburnt i may sit in a corner and cry heigh ho for a husband i would rather have one of your father's getting hath your grace ne'er a brother like you your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them no my lord unless i might have another for working days your grace is too costly to wear every day but i beseech your grace pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter no sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was i born cousins god give you joy i cry you mercy uncle by your grace's pardon against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come yea just so much as you may take upon a knife's point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach signior fare you well what fire is in mine ears can this be true stand i condemned for pride and scorn so much contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu no glory lives behind the back of such and benedick love on i will requite thee taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band for others say thou dost deserve and i believe it better than reportingly good morrow sweet hero i am out of all other tune methinks you light o' love with your heels then if your husband have stables enough you'll see he shall lack no barns 'tis almost five o'clock cousin 'tis time you were ready by my troth i am exceeding ill heigh ho for the letter that begins them all h what means the fool trow i am stuffed cousin i cannot smell o god help me god help me how long have you professed apprehension it is not seen enough you should wear it in your cap by my troth i am sick benedictus why benedictus you have some moral in this benedictus what pace is this that thy tongue keeps why how now cousin wherefore sink you down dead i think help uncle  hero why hero uncle signior benedick friar how now cousin hero o on my soul my cousin is belied no truly not although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow yea and i will weep a while longer you have no reason i do it freely ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her a very even way but no such friend it is a man's office but not yours as strange as the thing i know not it were as possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as you but believe me not and yet i lie not i confess nothing nor i deny nothing i am sorry for my cousin do not swear and eat it will you not eat your word why then god forgive me you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to protest i loved you i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest kill claudio you kill me to deny it farewell i am gone though i am here there is no love in you nay i pray you let me go in faith i will go you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonored my kinswoman o that i were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancor o god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the marketplace talk with a man out at a window a proper saying sweet hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone princes and counties surely a princely testimony a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into curtsies valor into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears it i cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving use it for my love some other way than swearing by it yea as sure as i have a thought or a soul yea signior and depart when you bid me then is spoken fare you well now and yet ere i go let me go with that i came which is with knowing what hath passed between you and claudio foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore i will depart unkissed for them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me in spite of your heart i think alas poor heart if you spite it for my sake i will spite it for yours for i will never love that which my friend hates it appears not in this confession there's not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself and how long is that think you very ill very ill too will you go hear this news signior i answer to that name what is your will why no no more than reason do not you love me why then my cousin margaret and ursula are much deceived for they did swear you did they swore that you were well nigh dead for me no truly but in friendly recompense i would not deny you but by this good day i yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life for i was told you were in a consumption
