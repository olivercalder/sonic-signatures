call here my varlet i'll unarm again why should i war without the walls of troy that find such cruel battle here within each trojan that is master of his heart let him to field troilus alas hath none the greeks are strong and skilful to their strength fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant but i am weaker than a woman's tear tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance less valiant than the virgin in the night and skilless as unpracticed infancy have i not tarried have i not tarried still have i tarried patience herself what goddess e'er she be doth lesser blench at suff'rance than i do at priam's royal table do i sit and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts  so traitor when she comes when is she thence i was about to tell thee when my heart as wedgèd with a sigh would rive in twain lest hector or my father should perceive me i have as when the sun doth light a scorn buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile but sorrow that is couched in seeming gladness is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness o pandarus i tell thee pandarus when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drowned reply not in how many fathoms deep they lie indrenched i tell thee i am mad in cressid's love thou answer'st she is fair pourest in the open ulcer of my heart her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice handiest in thy discourse o that her hand in whose comparison all whites are ink writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure the cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense hard as the palm of plowman this thou tell'st me as true thou tell'st me when i say i love her but saying thus instead of oil and balm thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me the knife that made it thou dost not speak so much good pandarus how now pandarus what art thou angry pandarus what with me say i she is not fair pandarus  sweet pandarus  peace you ungracious clamors peace rude sounds fools on both sides helen must needs be fair when with your blood you daily paint her thus i cannot fight upon this argument it is too starved a subject for my sword but pandarus o gods how do you plague me i cannot come to cressid but by pandar and he's as tetchy to be wooed to woo as she is stubborn chaste against all suit tell me apollo for thy daphnes love what cressid is what pandar and what we her bed is india there she lies a pearl between our ilium and where she resides let it be called the wild and wand'ring flood ourself the merchant and this sailing pandar our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark because not there this woman's answer sorts for womanish it is to be from thence what news aeneas from the field today by whom aeneas let paris bleed 'tis but a scar to scorn paris is gored with menelaus' horn better at home if would i might were may but to the sport abroad are you bound thither come go we then together fie fie my brother weigh you the worth and honor of a king so great as our dread father's in a scale of common ounces will you with counters sum the past proportion of his infinite and buckle in a waist most fathomless with spans and inches so diminutive as fears and reasons fie for godly shame you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest you fur your gloves with reason here are your reasons you know an enemy intends you harm you know a sword employed is perilous and reason flies the object of all harm who marvels then when helenus beholds a grecian and his sword if he do set the very wings of reason to his heels and fly like chidden mercury from jove or like a star disorbed nay if we talk of reason let's shut our gates and sleep manhood and honor should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts with this crammed reason reason and respect make livers pale and lustihood deject what's aught but as 'tis valued i take today a wife and my election is led on in the conduct of my will  my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores of will and judgment how may i avoid although my will distaste what it elected the wife i choose there can be no evasion to blench from this and to stand firm by honor we turn not back the silks upon the merchant when we have soiled them nor the remainder viands we do not throw in unrespective sieve because we now are full it was thought meet paris should do some vengeance on the greeks your breath with full consent bellied his sails the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce and did him service he touched the ports desired and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness wrinkles apollo's and makes pale the morning why keep we her the grecians keep our aunt is she worth keeping why she is a pearl whose price hath launched above a thousand ships and turned crowned kings to merchants if you'll avouch 'twas wisdom paris went  as you must needs for you all cried go go  if you'll confess he brought home worthy prize  as you must needs for you all clapped your hands and cried inestimable why do you now the issue of your proper wisdoms rate and do a deed that never fortune did beggar the estimation which you prized richer than sea and land o theft most base that we have stol'n what we do fear to keep but thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n that in their country did them that disgrace we fear to warrant in our native place 'tis our mad sister i do know her voice why brother hector we may not think the justness of each act such and no other than event doth form it nor once deject the courage of our minds because cassandra's mad her brainsick raptures cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel which hath our several honors all engaged to make it gracious for my private part i am no more touched than all priam's sons and jove forbid there should be done amongst us such things as might offend the weakest spleen to fight for and maintain why there you touched the life of our design were it not glory that we more affected than the performance of our heaving spleens i would not wish a drop of trojan blood spent more in her defense but worthy hector she is a theme of honor and renown a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds whose present courage may beat down our foes and fame in time to come canonize us for i presume brave hector would not lose so rich advantage of a promised glory as smiles upon the forehead of this action for the wide world's revenue sirrah walk off no pandarus i stalk about her door like a strange soul upon the stygian banks staying for waftage o be thou my charon and give me swift transportance to those fields where i may wallow in the lily beds proposed for the deserver o gentle pandar from cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings and fly with me to cressid i am giddy expectation whirls me round th' imaginary relish is so sweet that it enchants my sense what will it be when that the wat'ry palate taste indeed love's thrice repurèd nectar death i fear me swooning destruction or some joy too fine too subtle potent tuned too sharp in sweetness for the capacity of my ruder powers i fear it much and i do fear besides that i shall lose distinction in my joys as doth a battle when they charge on heaps the enemy flying even such a passion doth embrace my bosom my heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse and all my powers do their bestowing lose like vassalage at unawares encount'ring the eye of majesty you have bereft me of all words lady o cressid how often have i wished me thus what should they grant what makes this pretty abruption what too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love fears make devils of cherubins they never see truly o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupid's pageant there is presented no monster nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confined that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit are there such such are not we praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present we will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble few words to fair faith troilus shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer than troilus you know now your hostages your uncle's word and my firm faith why was my cressid then so hard to win and shall albeit sweet music issues thence your leave sweet cressid what offends you lady you cannot shun yourself well know they what they speak that speak so wisely o that i thought it could be in a woman  as if it can i will presume in you  to feed for aye her lamp and flames of love to keep her constancy in plight and youth outliving beauty's outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays or that persuasion could but thus convince me that my integrity and truth to you might be affronted with the match and weight of such a winnowed purity in love how were i then uplifted but alas i am as true as truth's simplicity and simpler than the infancy of truth o virtuous fight when right with right wars who shall be most right true swains in love shall in the world to come approve their truth by troilus when their rhymes full of protest of oath and big compare wants similes truth tired with iteration  as true as steel as plantage to the moon as sun to day as turtle to her mate as iron to adamant as earth to th' center  yet after all comparisons of truth as truth's authentic author to be cited as true as troilus shall crown up the verse and sanctify the numbers amen dear trouble not yourself the morn is cold trouble him not to bed to bed sleep kill those pretty eyes and give as soft attachment to thy senses as infants' empty of all thought i prithee now to bed o cressida but that the busy day waked by the lark hath roused the ribald crows and dreaming night will hide our joys no longer i would not from thee beshrew the witch with venomous wights she stays as tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love with wings more momentary swift than thought you will catch cold and curse me it is your uncle ha ha how now what's the matter is it so concluded how my achievements mock me i will go meet them and my lord aeneas we met by chance you did not find me here walk into her house i'll bring her to the grecian presently and to his hand when i deliver her think it an altar and thy brother troilus a priest there off'ring to it his own heart cressid i love thee in so strained a purity that the blest gods as angry with my fancy  more bright in zeal than the devotion which cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me a hateful truth from troy and troilus and suddenly where injury of chance puts back leave taking jostles roughly by all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips of all rejoindure forcibly prevents our locked embrasures strangles our dear vows even in the birth of our own laboring breath we two that with so many thousand sighs did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves with the rude brevity and discharge of one injurious time now with a robber's haste crams his rich thiev'ry up he knows not how as many farewells as be stars in heaven with distinct breath and consigned kisses to them he fumbles up into a loose adieu and scants us with a single famished kiss distasted with the salt of broken tears hark you are called some say the genius cries so to him that instantly must die  bid them have patience she shall come anon no remedy hear me my love be thou but true of heart  nay we must use expostulation kindly for it is parting from us i speak not be thou true as fearing thee for i will throw my glove to death himself that there is no maculation in thy heart but be thou true say i to fashion in my sequent protestation be thou true and i will see thee and i'll grow friend with danger wear this sleeve i will corrupt the grecian sentinels to give thee nightly visitation but yet be true hear why i speak it love the grecian youths are full of quality their loving well composed with gift of nature flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise how novelty may move and parts with person alas a kind of godly jealousy  which i beseech you call a virtuous sin  makes me afeard die i a villain then in this i do not call your faith in question so mainly as my merit i cannot sing nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk nor play at subtle games fair virtues all to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant but i can tell that in each grace of these there lurks a still and dumb discursive devil that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted no but something may be done that we will not and sometimes we are devils to ourselves when we will tempt the frailty of our powers presuming on their changeful potency come kiss and let us part good brother come you hither and bring aeneas and the grecian with you who i alas it is my vice my fault whiles others fish with craft for great opinion i with great truth catch mere simplicity whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns with truth and plainness i do wear mine bare fear not my truth the moral of my wit is plain and true there's all the reach of it welcome sir diomed here is the lady which for antenor we deliver you at the port lord i'll give her to thy hand and by the way possess thee what she is entreat her fair and by my soul fair greek if e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword name cressid and thy life shall be as safe as priam is in ilium grecian thou dost not use me courteously to shame the zeal of my petition to thee in praising her i tell thee lord of greece she is as far high soaring o'er thy praises as thou unworthy to be called her servant i charge thee use her well even for my charge for by the dreadful pluto if thou dost not though the great bulk achilles be thy guard i'll cut thy throat come to the port i'll tell thee diomed this brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head  lady give me your hand and as we walk to our own selves bend we our needful talk hector thou sleep'st awake thee my lord ulysses tell me i beseech you in what place of the field doth calchas keep shall i sweet lord be bound to you so much after we part from agamemnon's tent to bring me thither o sir to such as boasting show their scars a mock is due will you walk on my lord she was beloved she loved she is and doth but still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth sweet sir you honor me cressid comes forth to him yea so familiar what should she remember hold patience thy better must o plague and madness behold i pray you i prithee stay i pray you stay by hell and all hell's torments i will not speak a word doth that grieve thee o withered truth by jove i will be patient she strokes his cheek nay stay by jove i will not speak a word there is between my will and all offenses a guard of patience stay a little while fear me not my lord i will not be myself nor have cognition of what i feel i am all patience o beauty where is thy faith i will be patient outwardly i will i did swear patience wert thou the devil and wor'st it on thy horn it should be challenged nor i by pluto but that that likes not you pleases me best it is to make a recordation to my soul of every syllable that here was spoke but if i tell how these two did co act shall i not lie in publishing a truth sith yet there is a credence in my heart an esperance so obstinately strong that doth invert th' attest of eyes and ears as if those organs had deceptious functions created only to calumniate was cressid here she was not sure why my negation hath no taste of madness let it not be believed for womanhood think we had mothers do not give advantage to stubborn critics apt without a theme for depravation to square the general sex by cressid's rule rather think this not cressid nothing at all unless that this were she this she no this is diomed's cressida if beauty have a soul this is not she if souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies if sanctimony be the gods' delight if there be rule in unity itself this is not she o madness of discourse that cause sets up with and against itself bifold authority where reason can revolt without perdition and loss assume all reason without revolt this is and is not cressid within my soul there doth conduce a fight of this strange nature that a thing inseparate divides more wider than the sky and earth and yet the spacious breadth of this division admits no orifex for a point as subtle as ariachne's broken woof to enter instance o instance strong as pluto's gates cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven instance o instance strong as heaven itself the bonds of heaven are slipped dissolved and loosed and with another knot five finger tied the fractions of her faith orts of her love the fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics of her o'er eaten faith are given to diomed ay greek and that shall be divulgèd well in characters as red as mars his heart inflamed with venus never did young man fancy with so eternal and so fixed a soul hark greek as much as i do cressid love so much by weight hate i her diomed that sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm were it a casque composed by vulcan's skill my sword should bite it not the dreadful spout which shipmen do the hurricano call constringed in mass by the almighty sun shall dizzy with more clamor neptune's ear in his descent than shall my prompted sword falling on diomed o cressid o false cressid false false false let all untruths stand by thy stainèd name and they'll seem glorious have with you prince my courteous lord adieu  farewell revolted fair and diomed stand fast and wear a castle on thy head accept distracted thanks brother you have a vice of mercy in you which better fits a lion than a man when many times the captive grecian falls even in the fan and wind of your fair sword you bid them rise and live fool's play by heaven hector for th' love of all the gods let's leave the hermit pity with our mother and when we have our armors buckled on the venomed vengeance ride upon our swords spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth hector then 'tis wars who should withhold me not fate obedience nor the hand of mars beck'ning with fiery truncheon my retire not priamus and hecuba on knees their eyes o'er gallèd with recourse of tears nor you my brother with your true sword drawn opposed to hinder me should stop my way but by my ruin this foolish dreaming superstitious girl makes all these bodements away away they are at it hark proud diomed believe i come to lose my arm or win my sleeve what now let me read words words mere words no matter from the heart th' effect doth operate another way go wind to wind there turn and change together my love with words and errors still she feeds but edifies another with her deeds fly not for shouldst thou take the river styx i would swim after o traitor diomed turn thy false face thou traitor and pay the life thou owest me for my horse come both you cogging greeks have at you both ajax hath ta'en aeneas shall it be no by the flame of yonder glorious heaven he shall not carry him i'll be ta'en too or bring him off fate hear me what i say i reck not though i end my life today hector is slain he's dead and at the murderer's horse's tail in beastly sort dragged through the shameful field frown on you heavens effect your rage with speed sit gods upon your thrones and smite at troy i say at once let your brief plagues be mercy and linger not our sure destructions on you understand me not that tell me so i do not speak of flight of fear of death but dare all imminence that gods and men address their dangers in hector is gone who shall tell priam so or hecuba let him that will a screech owl aye be called go into troy and say their hector's dead there is a word will priam turn to stone make wells and niobes of the maids and wives cold statues of the youth and in a word scare troy out of itself but march away hector is dead there is no more to say stay yet you vile abominable tents thus proudly pitched upon our phrygian plains let titan rise as early as he dare i'll through and through you and thou great sized coward no space of earth shall sunder our two hates i'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still that moldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts strike a free march to troy with comfort go hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe hence broker lackey ignomy and shame pursue thy life and live aye with thy name
