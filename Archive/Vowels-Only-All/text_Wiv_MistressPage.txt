searched for him in a basket protests to my husband he is now here and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport to make another experiment of his suspicion but i am glad the knight is not here now he shall see his own foolery hard by at street end he will be here anon why then you are utterly shamed and he's but a dead man what a woman are you away with him away with him better shame than murder alas three of master ford's brothers watch the door with pistols that none shall issue out otherwise you might slip away ere he came but what make you here creep into the kiln hole if you go out in your own semblance you die sir john unless you go out disguised alas the day i know not there is no woman's gown big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat a muffler and a kerchief and so escape on my word it will serve him she's as big as he is and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler too run up sir john quick quick we'll come dress you straight put on the gown the while heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards ay in good sadness is he and talks of the basket too howsoever he hath had intelligence nay but he'll be here presently let's go dress him like the witch of brentford hang him dishonest varlet we cannot misuse him enough we'll leave a proof by that which we will do wives may be merry and yet honest too we do not act that often jest and laugh 'tis old but true still swine eats all the draff come mother pratt come give me your hand are you not ashamed i think you have killed the poor woman trust me he beat him most pitifully i'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the altar it hath done meritorious service the spirit of wantonness is sure scared out of him if the devil have him not in fee simple with fine and recovery he will never i think in the way of waste attempt us again yes by all means if it be but to scrape the figures out of your husband's brains if they can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further afflicted we two will still be the ministers come to the forge with it then shape it i would not have things cool within a quarter of an hour there is an old tale goes that herne the hunter sometime a keeper here in windsor forest doth all the wintertime at still midnight walk round about an oak with great ragged horns and there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle and makes milch kine yield blood and shakes a chain in a most hideous and dreadful manner you have heard of such a spirit and well you know the superstitious idle headed eld received and did deliver to our age this tale of herne the hunter for a truth that likewise have we thought upon and thus nan page my daughter and my little son and three or four more of their growth we'll dress like urchins aufs and fairies green and white with rounds of waxen tapers on their heads and rattles in their hands upon a sudden as falstaff she and i are newly met let them from forth a sawpit rush at once with some diffusèd song upon their sight we two in great amazedness will fly then let them all encircle him about and fairy like to pinch the unclean knight and ask him why that hour of fairy revel in their so sacred paths he dares to tread in shape profane the truth being known we'll all present ourselves dis horn the spirit and mock him home to windsor my nan shall be the queen of all the fairies finely attirèd in a robe of white fear not you that go get us properties and tricking for our fairies go mistress ford send quickly to sir john to know his mind i'll to the doctor he hath my good will and none but he to marry with nan page that slender though well landed is an idiot and he my husband best of all affects the doctor is well moneyed and his friends potent at court he none but he shall have her though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her master doctor my daughter is in green when you see your time take her by the hand away with her to the deanery and dispatch it quickly go before into the park we two must go together fare you well sir my husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying my daughter but 'tis no matter better a little chiding than a great deal of heartbreak they are all couched in a pit hard by herne's oak with obscured lights which at the very instant of falstaff's and our meeting they will at once display to the night if he be not amazed he will be mocked if he be amazed he will every way be mocked against such lewdsters and their lechery those that betray them do no treachery alas what noise away away i pray you come hold up the jest no higher  now good sir john how like you windsor wives see you these husband do not these fair yokes become the forest better than the town why sir john do you think though we would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders and have given ourselves without scruple to hell that ever the devil could have made you our delight a puffed man doctors doubt that if anne page be my daughter she is by this doctor caius' wife good george be not angry i knew of your purpose turned my daughter into green and indeed she is now with the doctor at the deanery and there married why did you take her in green why went you not with master doctor maid well i will muse no further master fenton heaven give you many many merry days  good husband let us every one go home and laugh this sport o'er by a country fire  sir john and all
