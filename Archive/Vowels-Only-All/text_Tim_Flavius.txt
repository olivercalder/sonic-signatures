my lord yes my lord more jewels yet there is no crossing him in 's humor else i should tell him well i' faith i should when all's spent he'd be crossed then an he could 'tis pity bounty had not eyes behind that man might ne'er be wretched for his mind i beseech your honor vouchsafe me a word it does concern you near i scarce know how what will this come to he commands us to provide and give great gifts and all out of an empty coffer nor will he know his purse or yield me this  to show him what a beggar his heart is being of no power to make his wishes good his promises fly so beyond his state that what he speaks is all in debt he owes for ev'ry word he is so kind that he now pays interest for 't his land's put to their books well would i were gently put out of office before i were forced out happier is he that has no friend to feed than such that do e'en enemies exceed i bleed inwardly for my lord no care no stop so senseless of expense that he will neither know how to maintain it nor cease his flow of riot takes no account how things go from him nor resumes no care of what is to continue never mind was to be so unwise to be so kind what shall be done he will not hear till feel i must be round with him now he comes from hunting fie fie fie fie please you gentlemen the time is unagreeable to this business your importunacy cease till after dinner that i may make his lordship understand wherefore you are not paid pray draw near pray you walk near i'll speak with you anon you would not hear me at many leisures i proposed  o my good lord at many times i brought in my accounts laid them before you you would throw them off and say you found them in mine honesty when for some trifling present you have bid me return so much i have shook my head and wept  yea 'gainst th' authority of manners prayed you to hold your hand more close i did endure not seldom nor no slight checks when i have prompted you in the ebb of your estate and your great flow of debts my lovèd lord though you hear now too late yet now's a time the greatest of your having lacks a half to pay your present debts 'tis all engaged some forfeited and gone and what remains will hardly stop the mouth of present dues the future comes apace what shall defend the interim and at length how goes our reck'ning o my good lord the world is but a word were it all yours to give it in a breath how quickly were it gone if you suspect my husbandry of falsehood call me before th' exactest auditors and set me on the proof so the gods bless me when all our offices have been oppressed with riotous feeders when our vaults have wept with drunken spilth of wine when every room hath blazed with lights and brayed with minstrelsy i have retired me to a wasteful cock and set mine eyes at flow heavens have i said the bounty of this lord how many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants this night englutted who is not timon's what heart head sword force means but is lord timon's great timon noble worthy royal timon ah when the means are gone that buy this praise the breath is gone whereof this praise is made feast won fast lost one cloud of winter showers these flies are couched assurance bless your thoughts lord lucius and lucullus humh i have been bold  for that i knew it the most general way  to them to use your signet and your name but they do shake their heads and i am here no richer in return they answer in a joint and corporate voice that now they are at fall want treasure cannot do what they would are sorry you are honorable but yet they could have wished they know not  something hath been amiss a noble nature may catch a wrench would all were well 'tis pity and so intending other serious matters after distasteful looks and these hard fractions with certain half caps and cold moving nods they froze me into silence i would i could not think it that thought is bounty's foe being free itself it thinks all others so what do you ask of me my friend ay if money were as certain as your waiting 'twere sure enough why then preferred you not your sums and bills when your false masters eat of my lord's meat then they could smile and fawn upon his debts and take down th' int'rest into their glutt'nous maws you do yourselves but wrong to stir me up let me pass quietly believe 't my lord and i have made an end i have no more to reckon he to spend if 'twill not serve 'tis not so base as you for you serve knaves my dear lord  my lord  here my lord o my lord you only speak from your distracted soul there's not so much left to furnish out a moderate table alack my fellows what should i say to you let me be recorded by the righteous gods i am as poor as you all broken implements of a ruined house good fellows all the latest of my wealth i'll share amongst you wherever we shall meet for timon's sake let's yet be fellows let's shake our heads and say as 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes we have seen better dayslet each take some nay put out all your hands not one word more thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor o the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us who would not wish to be from wealth exempt since riches point to misery and contempt who would be so mocked with glory or to live but in a dream of friendship to have his pomp and all what state compounds but only painted like his varnished friends poor honest lord brought low by his own heart undone by goodness strange unusual blood when man's worst sin is he does too much good who then dares to be half so kind again for bounty that makes gods do still mar men my dearest lord blest to be most accursed rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes are made thy chief afflictions alas kind lord he's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat of monstrous friends nor has he with him to supply his life or that which can command it i'll follow and inquire him out i'll ever serve his mind with my best will whilst i have gold i'll be his steward still o you gods is yond despised and ruinous man my lord full of decay and flailing o monument and wonder of good deeds evilly bestowed what an alteration of honor has desp'rate want made what viler thing upon the earth than friends who can bring noblest minds to basest ends how rarely does it meet with this time's guise when man was wished to love his enemies grant i may ever love and rather woo those that would mischief me than those that do has caught me in his eye i will present my honest grief unto him and as my lord still serve him with my life my dearest master have you forgot me sir an honest poor servant of yours the gods are witness ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief for his undone lord than mine eyes for you i beg of you to know me good my lord t' accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts to entertain me as your steward still no my most worthy master in whose breast doubt and suspect alas are placed too late you should have feared false times when you did feast suspect still comes where an estate is least that which i show heaven knows is merely love duty and zeal to your unmatchèd mind care of your food and living and believe it my most honored lord for any benefit that points to me either in hope or present i'd exchange for this one wish that you had power and wealth to requite me by making rich yourself o let me stay and comfort you my master it is vain that you would speak with timon for he is set so only to himself that nothing but himself which looks like man is friendly with him here is his cave  peace and content be here lord timon timon look out and speak to friends th' athenians by two of their most reverend senate greet thee speak to them noble timon stay not all's in vain trouble him no further thus you still shall find him
