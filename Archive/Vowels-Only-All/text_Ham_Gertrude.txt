supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king's remembrance thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changèd son go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is ay amen i doubt it is no other but the main  his father's death and our o'erhasty marriage more matter with less art came this from hamlet to her it may be very like so he does indeed but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading did he receive you well did you assay him to any pastime i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet's wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honors come hither my dear hamlet sit by me the lady doth protest too much methinks how fares my lord i'll warrant you fear me not withdraw i hear him coming hamlet thou hast thy father much offended come come you answer with an idle tongue why how now hamlet have you forgot me nay then i'll set those to you that can speak what wilt thou do thou wilt not murder me help ho o me what hast thou done o what a rash and bloody deed is this as kill a king what have i done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me ay me what act that roars so loud and thunders in the index o hamlet speak no more thou turn'st my eyes into my very soul and there i see such black and grainèd spots as will not leave their tinct o speak to me no more these words like daggers enter in my ears no more sweet hamlet no more alas he's mad alas how is 't with you that you do bend your eye on vacancy and with th' incorporal air do hold discourse forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep and as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm your bedded hair like life in excrements start up and stand an end o gentle son upon the heat and flame of thy distemper sprinkle cool patience whereon do you look to whom do you speak this nothing at all yet all that is i see no nothing but ourselves this is the very coinage of your brain this bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in o hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain what shall i do be thou assured if words be made of breath and breath of life i have no life to breathe what thou hast said to me alack i had forgot 'tis so concluded on bestow this place on us a little while ah mine own lord what have i seen tonight mad as the sea and wind when both contend which is the mightier in his lawless fit behind the arras hearing something stir whips out his rapier cries a rat a rat and in this brainish apprehension kills the unseen good old man to draw apart the body he hath killed o'er whom his very madness like some ore among a mineral of metals base shows itself pure he weeps for what is done i will not speak with her what would she have let her come in to my sick soul as sin's true nature is each toy seems prologue to some great amiss so full of artless jealousy is guilt it spills itself in fearing to be spilt how now ophelia alas sweet lady what imports this song nay but ophelia  alas look here my lord alack what noise is this how cheerfully on the false trail they cry o this is counter you false danish dogs calmly good laertes but not by him one woe doth tread upon another's heel so fast they follow your sister's drowned laertes there is a willow grows askant the brook that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream therewith fantastic garlands did she make of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples that liberal shepherds give a grosser name but our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them there on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds clamb'ring to hang an envious sliver broke when down her weedy trophies and herself fell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wide and mermaid like awhile they bore her up which time she chanted snatches of old lauds as one incapable of her own distress or like a creature native and endued unto that element but long it could not be till that her garments heavy with their drink pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death drowned drowned sweets to the sweet farewell i hoped thou shouldst have been my hamlet's wife i thought thy bride bed to have decked sweet maid and not have strewed thy grave hamlet hamlet o my son what theme for love of god forbear him this is mere madness and thus awhile the fit will work on him anon as patient as the female dove when that her golden couplets are disclosed his silence will sit drooping he's fat and scant of breath  here hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows the queen carouses to thy fortune hamlet i will my lord i pray you pardon me come let me wipe thy face no no the drink the drink o my dear hamlet the drink the drink i am poisoned
