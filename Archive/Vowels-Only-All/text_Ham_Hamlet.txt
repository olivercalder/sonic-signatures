a little more than kin and less than kind not so my lord i am too much in the sun ay madam it is common seems madam nay it is i know not seems 'tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forced breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected havior of the visage together with all forms moods shapes of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passes show these but the trappings and the suits of woe i shall in all my best obey you madam o that

much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on 't frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father's body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourned longer married with my uncle my father's brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her gallèd eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself sir my good friend i'll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio  marcellus i am very glad to see you good even sir  but what in faith make you from wittenberg i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do my

farewell my father's spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men's eyes

kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge ay marry is 't but to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honored in the breach than the observance this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traduced and taxed of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though performed at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by the o'ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o'erleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature's livery or fortune's star his virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of evil doth all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou com'st in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee i'll call thee hamlet king

oped his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again what may this mean that thou dead corse again in complete steel revisits thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls say why is this wherefore what should we do it will not speak then i will follow it why what should be the

cursèd spite that ever i was born to set it right nay come let's go together well god a mercy excellent well you are a fishmonger then i would you were so honest a man ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter let her not walk i' th' sun conception is a blessing but as your daughter may conceive friend look to 't words words words between who slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have gray beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself sir shall grow old as i am if like a crab you could go backward into my grave you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life these tedious old fools my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do you both nor the soles of her shoe then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favors in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what news then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither denmark's a prison a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o' th' worst why then 'tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams a dream itself is but a shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows shall we to th' court for by my fay i cannot reason no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come come deal justly with me come come nay speak anything but to th' purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color i know the good king and queen have sent for you that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer can charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen molt no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o'erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor women neither though by your smiling you seem to say so why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute on me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' th' sear and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for 't what players are they how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed how comes it do they grow rusty what are they children who maintains 'em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession is 't possible do the boys carry it away it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little 'sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come then th' appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outwards should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir a monday morning 'twas then indeed my lord i have news to tell you when roscius was an actor in rome  buzz buzz then came each actor on his ass o jephthah judge of israel what a treasure hadst thou why one fair daughter and no more the which he lovèd passing well am i not i' th' right old jephthah nay that follows not why as by lot god wot and then you know it came to pass as most like it was  the first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look where my abridgment comes you are welcome masters welcome all i am glad to see thee well welcome good friends o my old friend why thy face is valanced since i saw thee last com'st thou to beard me in denmark what my young lady and mistress by 'r lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chopine pray god your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring masters you are all welcome we'll e'en to 't like french falconers fly at anything we see we'll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million 'twas caviary to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in 't i chiefly loved 'twas aeneas' tale to dido and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of priam's slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th' hyrcanian beast  'tis not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couchèd in th' ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smeared with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly tricked with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons baked and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damnèd light to their lord's murder roasted in wrath and fire and thus o'ersizèd with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you it shall to the barber's with your beard  prithee say on he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba the moblèd queen 'tis well i'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live god's bodykins man much better use every man after his desert and who shall 'scape whipping use them after your own honor and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in follow him friends we'll hear a play tomorrow dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago we'll ha 't tomorrow night you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in 't could you not very well follow that lord and look you mock him not my good friends i'll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore ay so good bye to you now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wanned tears in his eyes distraction in his aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what's hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appall the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damned defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i' th' throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha 'swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeon livered and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave's offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murdered prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a stallion fie upon 't foh about my brains hum i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i'll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i'll observe his looks i'll tent him to the quick if he do blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be a devil and the devil hath power t' assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i'll have grounds more relative than this the play's the thing wherein i'll catch the conscience of the king to be or not to be that is the question whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep  no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished to die to sleep  to sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there's the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time th' oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely the pangs of despised love the law's delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of th' unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pitch and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remembered i humbly thank you well no not i i never gave you aught ha ha are you honest are you fair that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offenses at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where's your father let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in 's own house farewell if thou dost marry i'll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell i have heard of your paintings too well enough god hath given you one face and you make yourselves another you jig and amble and you lisp you nickname god's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance go to i'll no more on 't it hath made me mad i say we will have no more marriage those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are to a nunnery go speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of our players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so o'erdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it makes the unskillful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theater of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having th' accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that's villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready how now my lord will the king hear this piece of work bid the players make haste will you two help to hasten them what ho horatio horatio thou art e'en as just a man as e'er my conversation coped withal nay do not think i flatter for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits to feed and clothe thee why should the poor be flattered no let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning dost thou hear since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish her election hath sealed thee for herself for thou hast been as one in suffering all that suffers nothing a man that fortune's buffets and rewards hast ta'en with equal thanks and blessed are those whose blood and judgment are so well commeddled that they are not a pipe for fortune's finger to sound what stop she please give me that man that is not passion's slave and i will wear him in my heart's core ay in my heart of heart as i do thee something too much of this  there is a play tonight before the king one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my father's death i prithee when thou seest that act afoot even with the very comment of thy soul observe my uncle if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech it is a damnèd ghost that we have seen and my imaginations are as foul as vulcan's stithy give him heedful note for i mine eyes will rivet to his face and after we will both our judgments join in censure of his seeming they are coming to the play i must be idle get you a place excellent i' faith of the chameleon's dish i eat the air promise crammed you cannot feed capons so no nor mine now my lord you played once i' th' university you say what did you enact it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there be the players ready no good mother here's metal more attractive lady shall i lie in your lap i mean my head upon your lap do you think i meant country matters that's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs nothing who i o god your only jig maker what should a man do but be merry for look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died within 's two hours so long nay then let the devil wear black for i'll have a suit of sables o heavens die two months ago and not forgotten yet then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year but by 'r lady he must build churches then or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the hobby horse whose epitaph is for oh for oh the hobby horse is forgot marry this is miching mallecho it means mischief we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel they'll tell all ay or any show that you will show him be not you ashamed to show he'll not shame to tell you what it means is this a prologue or the posy of a ring as woman's love that's wormwood if she should break it now madam how like you this play o but she'll keep her word no no they do but jest poison in jest no offense i' th' world the mousetrap marry how tropically this play is the image of a murder done in vienna gonzago is the duke's name his wife baptista you shall see anon 'tis a knavish piece of work but what of that your majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not let the galled jade wince our withers are unwrung this is one lucianus nephew to the king i could interpret between you and your love if i could see the puppets dallying it would cost you a groaning to take off mine edge so you mis take your husbands begin murderer pox leave thy damnable faces and begin come the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge he poisons him i' th' garden for his estate his name's gonzago the story is extant and written in very choice italian you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of gonzago's wife what frighted with false fire why let the strucken deer go weep the hart ungallèd play for some must watch while some must sleep thus runs the world away would not this sir and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn turk with me with two provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players a whole one i for thou dost know o damon dear this realm dismantled was of jove himself and now reigns here a very very pajock o good horatio i'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound didst perceive upon the talk of the poisoning ah ha come some music come the recorders for if the king like not the comedy why then belike he likes it not perdy come some music sir a whole history ay sir what of him with drink sir your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor for for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more choler i am tame sir pronounce you are welcome sir i cannot make you a wholesome answer my wit's diseased but sir such answer as i can make you shall command or rather as you say my mother therefore no more but to the matter my mother you say  o wonderful son that can so 'stonish a mother but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration impart we shall obey were she ten times our mother have you any further trade with us and do still by these pickers and stealers sir i lack advancement ay sir but while the grass grows the proverb is something musty o the recorders let me see one to withdraw with you why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil i do not well understand that will you play upon this pipe i pray you i do beseech you it is as easy as lying govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music look you these are the stops why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me you would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it speak 'sblood do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe call me what instrument you will though you can fret me you cannot play upon me god bless you sir do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel methinks it is like a weasel or like a whale then i will come to my mother by and by they fool me to the top of my bent i will come by and by by and by is easily said leave me friends 'tis now the very witching time of night when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world now could i drink hot blood and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on soft now to my mother o heart lose not thy nature let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom let me be cruel not unnatural i will speak daggers to her but use none my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites how in my words somever she be shent to give them seals never my soul consent now might i do it pat now he is a praying and now i'll do 't and so he goes to heaven and so am i revenged that would be scanned a villain kills my father and for that i his sole son do this same villain send to heaven why this is hire and salary not revenge he took my father grossly full of bread with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may and how his audit stands who knows save heaven but in our circumstance and course of thought 'tis heavy with him and am i then revenged to take him in the purging of his soul when he is fit and seasoned for his passage no up sword and know thou a more horrid hent when he is drunk asleep or in his rage or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed at game a swearing or about some act that has no relish of salvation in 't  then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven and that his soul may be as damned and black as hell whereto it goes my mother stays this physic but prolongs thy sickly days mother mother mother now mother what's the matter mother you have my father much offended go go you question with a wicked tongue what's the matter now no by the rood not so you are the queen your husband's brother's wife and would it were not so you are my mother come come and sit you down you shall not budge you go not till i set you up a glass where you may see the inmost part of you how now a rat dead for a ducat dead nay i know not is it the king a bloody deed almost as bad good mother as kill a king and marry with his brother ay lady it was my word thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell i took thee for thy better take thy fortune thou find'st to be too busy is some danger leave wringing of your hands peace sit you down and let me wring your heart for so i shall if it be made of penetrable stuff if damnèd custom have not brazed it so that it be proof and bulwark against sense such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and sets a blister there makes marriage vows as false as dicers' oaths o such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words heaven's face does glow o'er this solidity and compound mass with heated visage as against the doom is thought sick at the act look here upon this picture and on this the counterfeit presentment of two brothers see what a grace was seated on this brow hyperion's curls the front of jove himself an eye like mars' to threaten and command a station like the herald mercury new lighted on a kissing hill a combination and a form indeed where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance of a man this was your husband look you now what follows here is your husband like a mildewed ear blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes could you on this fair mountain leave to feed and batten on this moor ha have you eyes you cannot call it love for at your age the heyday in the blood is tame it's humble and waits upon the judgment and what judgment would step from this to this sense sure you have else could you not have motion but sure that sense is apoplexed for madness would not err nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thralled but it reserved some quantity of choice to serve in such a difference what devil was 't that thus hath cozened you at hoodman blind eyes without feeling feeling without sight ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope o shame where is thy blush rebellious hell if thou canst mutine in a matron's bones to flaming youth let virtue be as wax and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardor gives the charge since frost itself as actively doth burn and reason panders will nay but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamèd bed stewed in corruption honeying and making love over the nasty sty a murderer and a villain a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord a vice of kings a cutpurse of the empire and the rule that from a shelf the precious diadem stole and put it in his pocket  a king of shreds and patches  save me and hover o'er me with your wings you heavenly guards what would your gracious figure do you not come your tardy son to chide that lapsed in time and passion lets go by th' important acting of your dread command o say how is it with you lady on him on him look you how pale he glares his form and cause conjoined preaching to stones would make them capable do not look upon me lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects then what i have to do will want true color tears perchance for blood do you see nothing there nor did you nothing hear why look you there look how it steals away my father in his habit as he lived look where he goes even now out at the portal ecstasy my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time and makes as healthful music it is not madness that i have uttered bring me to the test and i the matter will reword which madness would gambol from mother for love of grace lay not that flattering unction to your soul that not your trespass but my madness speaks it will but skin and film the ulcerous place whiles rank corruption mining all within infects unseen confess yourself to heaven repent what's past avoid what is to come and do not spread the compost on the weeds to make them ranker forgive me this my virtue for in the fatness of these pursy times virtue itself of vice must pardon beg yea curb and woo for leave to do him good o throw away the worser part of it and live the purer with the other half good night but go not to my uncle's bed assume a virtue if you have it not that monster custom who all sense doth eat of habits devil is angel yet in this that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery that aptly is put on refrain tonight and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence the next more easy for use almost can change the stamp of nature and either the devil or throw him out with wondrous potency once more good night and when you are desirous to be blest i'll blessing beg of you for this same lord i do repent but heaven hath pleased it so to punish me with this and this with me that i must be their scourge and minister i will bestow him and will answer well the death i gave him so again good night i must be cruel only to be kind this bad begins and worse remains behind one word more good lady not this by no means that i bid you do let the bloat king tempt you again to bed pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse and let him for a pair of reechy kisses or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers make you to ravel all this matter out that i essentially am not in madness but mad in craft 'twere good you let him know for who that's but a queen fair sober wise would from a paddock from a bat a gib such dear concernings hide who would do so no in despite of sense and secrecy unpeg the basket on the house's top let the birds fly and like the famous ape to try conclusions in the basket creep and break your own neck down i must to england you know that there's letters sealed and my two schoolfellows whom i will trust as i will adders fanged they bear the mandate they must sweep my way and marshal me to knavery let it work for 'tis the sport to have the enginer hoist with his own petard and 't shall go hard but i will delve one yard below their mines and blow them at the moon o 'tis most sweet when in one line two crafts directly meet this man shall set me packing i'll lug the guts into the neighbor room mother good night indeed this counselor is now most still most secret and most grave who was in life a foolish prating knave  come sir to draw toward an end with you  good night mother safely stowed but soft what noise who calls on hamlet o here they come compounded it with dust whereto 'tis kin do not believe it that i can keep your counsel and not mine own besides to be demanded of a sponge what replication should be made by the son of a king ay sir that soaks up the king's countenance his rewards his authorities but such officers do the king best service in the end he keeps them like an ape an apple in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to be last swallowed when he needs what you have gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again i am glad of it a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear the body is with the king but the king is not with the body the king is a thing  of nothing bring me to him hide fox and all after at supper not where he eats but where he is eaten a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him your worm is your only emperor for diet we fat all creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for maggots your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes but to one table that's the end a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar in heaven send thither to see if your messenger find him not there seek him i' th' other place yourself but if indeed you find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby he will stay till you come for england good i see a cherub that sees them but come for england farewell dear mother my mother father and mother is man and wife man and wife is one flesh and so my mother  come for england good sir whose powers are these how purposed sir i pray you who commands them sir goes it against the main of poland sir or for some frontier why then the polack never will defend it two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats will not debate the question of this straw this is th' impostume of much wealth and peace that inward breaks and shows no cause without why the man dies i humbly thank you sir i'll be with you straight go a little before how all occasions do inform against me and spur my dull revenge what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed a beast no more sure he that made us with such large discourse looking before and after gave us not that capability and godlike reason to fust in us unused now whether it be bestial oblivion or some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on th' event a thought which quartered hath but one part wisdom and ever three parts coward i do not know why yet i live to say this thing's to do sith i have cause and will and strength and means to do 't examples gross as earth exhort me witness this army of such mass and charge led by a delicate and tender prince whose spirit with divine ambition puffed makes mouths at the invisible event exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune death and danger dare even for an eggshell rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honor's at the stake how stand i then that have a father killed a mother stained excitements of my reason and my blood and let all sleep while to my shame i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men that for a fantasy and trick of fame go to their graves like beds fight for a plot whereon the numbers cannot try the cause which is not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain o from this time forth my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth has this fellow no feeling of his business he sings in grave making 'tis e'en so the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once how the knave jowls it to the ground as if 'twere cain's jawbone that did the first murder this might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o'erreaches one that would circumvent god might it not or of a courtier which could say good morrow sweet lord how dost thou sweet lord this might be my lord such a one that praised my lord such a one's horse when he went to beg it might it not why e'en so and now my lady worm's chapless and knocked about the mazard with a sexton's spade here's fine revolution an we had the trick to see 't did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with them mine ache to think on 't there's another why may not that be the skull of a lawyer where be his quiddities now his quillities his cases his tenures and his tricks why does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery hum this fellow might be in 's time a great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures the very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box and must th' inheritor himself have no more ha is not parchment made of sheepskins they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that i will speak to this fellow  whose grave's this sirrah i think it be thine indeed for thou liest in 't thou dost lie in 't to be in 't and say it is thine 'tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest what man dost thou dig it for what woman then who is to be buried in 't how absolute the knave is we must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us by the lord horatio this three years i have took note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe how long hast thou been grave maker how long is that since ay marry why was he sent into england why how came he mad how strangely upon what ground how long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot why he more than another whose was it nay i know not this let me see alas poor yorick i knew him horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath bore me on his back a thousand times and now how abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rises at it here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft where be your gibes now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar not one now to mock your own grinning quite chapfallen now get you to my lady's chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this favor she must come make her laugh at that prithee horatio tell me one thing dost thou think alexander looked o' this fashion i' th' earth and smelt so pah to what base uses we may return horatio why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died alexander was buried alexander returneth to dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer barrel imperious caesar dead and turned to clay might stop a hole to keep the wind away o that that earth which kept the world in awe should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw but soft but soft awhile here comes the king the queen the courtiers who is this they follow and with such maimèd rites this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desp'rate hand fordo its own life 'twas of some estate couch we awhile and mark that is laertes a very noble youth mark what the fair ophelia what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wand'ring stars and makes them stand like wonder wounded hearers this is i hamlet the dane thou pray'st not well i prithee take thy fingers from my throat for though i am not splenitive and rash yet have i in me something dangerous which let thy wisdom fear hold off thy hand why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum what wilt thou do for her 'swounds show me what thou 't do woo't weep woo't fight woo't fast woo't tear thyself woo't drink up eisel eat a crocodile i'll do 't dost thou come here to whine to outface me with leaping in her grave be buried quick with her and so will i and if thou prate of mountains let them throw millions of acres on us till our ground singeing his pate against the burning zone make ossa like a wart nay an thou 'lt mouth i'll rant as well as thou hear you sir what is the reason that you use me thus i loved you ever but it is no matter let hercules himself do what he may the cat will mew and dog will have his day so much for this sir now shall you see the other you do remember all the circumstance sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly  and praised be rashness for it let us know our indiscretion sometime serves us well when our deep plots do pall and that should learn us there's a divinity that shapes our ends rough hew them how we will  up from my cabin my sea gown scarfed about me in the dark groped i to find out them had my desire fingered their packet and in fine withdrew to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unfold their grand commission where i found horatio a royal knavery an exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmark's health and england's too with ho such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the ax my head should be struck off here's the commission read it at more leisure but wilt thou hear now how i did proceed being thus benetted round with villainies or i could make a prologue to my brains they had begun the play i sat me down devised a new commission wrote it fair  i once did hold it as our statists do a baseness to write fair and labored much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeoman's service wilt thou know th' effect of what i wrote an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm might flourish as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma 'tween their amities and many suchlike es of great charge that on the view and knowing of these contents without debatement further more or less he should those bearers put to sudden death not shriving time allowed why even in that was heaven ordinant i had my father's signet in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in the form of th' other subscribed it gave 't th' impression placed it safely the changeling never known now the next day was our sea fight and what to this was sequent thou knowest already why man they did make love to this employment they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow 'tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensèd points of mighty opposites does it not think thee stand me now upon  he that hath killed my king and whored my mother popped in between th' election and my hopes thrown out his angle for my proper life and with such cozenage is 't not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm and is 't not to be damned to let this canker of our nature come in further evil it will be short the interim's mine and a man's life's no more than to say one but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his i'll court his favors but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a tow'ring passion i humbly thank you sir dost know this waterfly thy state is the more gracious for 'tis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king's mess 'tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit put your bonnet to his right use 'tis for the head no believe me 'tis very cold the wind is northerly but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion i beseech you remember sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath what imports the nomination of this gentleman of him sir i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself what's his weapon that's two of his weapons but well  what call you the carriages the phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages  that's the french bet against the danish why is this all impawned as you call it how if i answer no sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty it is the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will yours he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for 's turn he did comply sir with his dug before he sucked it thus has he and many more of the same breed that i know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and out of an habit of encounter a kind of yeasty collection which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out i am constant to my purposes they follow the king's pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now in happy time she well instructs me i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart but it is no matter it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman not a whit we defy augury there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now 'tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man of aught he leaves knows what is 't to leave betimes let be give me your pardon sir i have done you wrong but pardon 't as you are a gentleman this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punished with a sore distraction what i have done that might your nature honor and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness was 't hamlet wronged laertes never hamlet if hamlet from himself be ta'en away and when he's not himself does wrong laertes then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it who does it then his madness if 't be so hamlet is of the faction that is wronged his madness is poor hamlet's enemy sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot my arrow o'er the house and hurt my brother i embrace it freely and will this brothers' wager frankly play  give us the foils come on i'll be your foil laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i' th' darkest night stick fiery off indeed no by this hand very well my lord your grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side this likes me well these foils have all a length come on sir one judgment i'll play this bout first set it by awhile come another hit what say you good madam i dare not drink yet madam by and by come for the third laertes you do but dally i pray you pass with your best violence i am afeard you make a wanton of me nay come again how does the queen o villainy ho let the door be locked treachery seek it out the point envenomed too then venom to thy work here thou incestuous murd'rous damnèd dane drink off this potion is thy union here follow my mother heaven make thee free of it i follow thee  i am dead horatio wretched queen adieu  you that look pale and tremble at this chance that are but mutes or audience to this act had i but time as this fell sergeant death is strict in his arrest o i could tell you  but let it be horatio i am dead thou livest report me and my cause aright to the unsatisfied as thou 'rt a man give me the cup let go by heaven i'll ha 't o god horatio what a wounded name things standing thus unknown shall i leave behind me if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart absent thee from felicity awhile and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain to tell my story what warlike noise is this o i die horatio the potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit i cannot live to hear the news from england but i do prophesy th' election lights on fortinbras he has my dying voice so tell him with th' occurrents more and less which have solicited the rest is silence o o o o
