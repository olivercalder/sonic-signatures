stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more till you conclude that he upon whose side the fewest roses are croppèd from the tree shall yield the other in the right opinion then for the truth and plainness of the case i pluck this pale and maiden blossom here giving my verdict on the white rose side if i my lord for my opinion bleed opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt and keep me on the side where still i am in your behalf still will i wear the same now sir to you that were so hot at sea disgracing of these colors that i wear in honor of my noble lord of york dar'st thou maintain the former words thou spak'st sirrah thy lord i honor as he is hark you not so in witness take you that well miscreant i'll be there as soon as you and after meet you sooner than you would grant me the combat gracious sovereign with him my lord for he hath done me wrong and that is my petition noble lord for though he seem with forgèd quaint conceit to set a gloss upon his bold intent yet know my lord i was provoked by him and he first took exceptions at this badge pronouncing that the paleness of this flower bewrayed the faintness of my master's heart nay let it rest where it began at first
