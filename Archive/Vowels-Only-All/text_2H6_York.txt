long live queen margaret england's happiness for suffolk's duke may he be suffocate that dims the honor of this warlike isle france should have torn and rent my very heart before i would have yielded to this league i never read but england's kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives and our king henry gives away his own to match with her that brings no vantages and so says york for he hath greatest cause anjou and maine are given to the french paris is lost the state of normandy stands on a tickle point now they are gone suffolk concluded on the articles the peers agreed and henry was well pleased to change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter i cannot blame them all what is 't to them 'tis thine they give away and not their own pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtesans still reveling like lords till all be gone whileas the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof while all is shared and all is borne away ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue while his own lands are bargained for and sold methinks the realms of england france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burnt unto the prince's heart of calydon anjou and maine both given unto the french cold news for me for i had hope of france even as i have of fertile england's soil a day will come when york shall claim his own and therefore i will take the nevilles' parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey and when i spy advantage claim the crown for that's the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right nor hold the scepter in his childish fist nor wear the diadem upon his head whose churchlike humors fits not for a crown then york be still awhile till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep to pry into the secrets of the state till henry surfeiting in joys of love with his new bride and england's dear bought queen and humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars then will i raise aloft the milk white rose with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed and in my standard bear the arms of york to grapple with the house of lancaster and force perforce i'll make him yield the crown whose bookish rule hath pulled fair england down if york have ill demeaned himself in france then let him be denied the regentship i'll tell thee suffolk why i am unmeet first for i cannot flatter thee in pride next if i be appointed for the place my lord of somerset will keep me here without discharge money or furniture till france be won into the dauphin's hands last time i danced attendance on his will till paris was besieged famished and lost doth anyone accuse york for a traitor base dunghill villain and mechanical i'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech  i do beseech your royal majesty let him have all the rigor of the law lay hands upon these traitors and their trash beldam i think we watched you at an inch what madam are you there the king and commonweal are deeply indebted for this piece of pains my lord protector will i doubt it not see you well guerdoned for these good deserts lord buckingham methinks you watched her well a pretty plot well chosen to build upon now pray my lord let's see the devil's writ what have we here the duke yet lives that henry shall depose but him outlive and die a violent death why this is just aio te aeacida romanos vincere posse well to the rest tell me what fate awaits the duke of suffolk by water shall he die and take his end what shall betide the duke of somerset let him shun castles safer shall he be upon the sandy plains than where castles mounted stand come come my lord these oracles are hardly attained and hardly understood the king is now in progress towards saint albans with him the husband of this lovely lady thither goes these news as fast as horse can carry them  a sorry breakfast for my lord protector at your pleasure my good lord who's within there ho invite my lords of salisbury and warwick to sup with me tomorrow night away now my good lords of salisbury and warwick our simple supper ended give me leave in this close walk to satisfy myself in craving your opinion of my title which is infallible to england's crown then thus edward the third my lords had seven sons the first edward the black prince prince of wales the second william of hatfield and the third lionel duke of clarence next to whom was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster the fifth was edmund langley duke of york the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester william of windsor was the seventh and last edward the black prince died before his father and left behind him richard his only son who after edward the third's death reigned as king till henry bolingbroke duke of lancaster the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt crowned by the name of henry the fourth seized on the realm deposed the rightful king sent his poor queen to france from whence she came and him to pomfret where as all you know harmless richard was murdered traitorously which now they hold by force and not by right for richard the first son's heir being dead the issue of the next son should have reigned the third son duke of clarence from whose line i claim the crown had issue philippa a daughter who married edmund mortimer earl of march edmund had issue roger earl of march roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor his eldest sister anne my mother being heir unto the crown married richard earl of cambridge who was son to edmund langley edward the third's fifth son by her i claim the kingdom she was heir to roger earl of march who was the son of edmund mortimer who married philippa sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence so if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger i am king we thank you lords but i am not your king till i be crowned and that my sword be stained with heart blood of the house of lancaster and that's not suddenly to be performed but with advice and silent secrecy do you as i do in these dangerous days wink at the duke of suffolk's insolence at beaufort's pride at somerset's ambition at buckingham and all the crew of them till they have snared the shepherd of the flock that virtuous prince the good duke humphrey 'tis that they seek and they in seeking that shall find their deaths if york can prophesy and neville this i do assure myself richard shall live to make the earl of warwick the greatest man in england but the king lords let him go please it your majesty this is the day appointed for the combat and ready are the appellant and defendant  the armorer and his man to enter the lists so please your highness to behold the fight i never saw a fellow worse bestead or more afraid to fight than is the appellant the servant of this armorer my lords dispatch this knave's tongue begins to double sound trumpets alarum to the combatants take away his weapon fellow thank god and the good wine in thy master's way and did he not in his protectorship levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers' pay in france and never sent it by means whereof the towns each day revolted cold news for me for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud and caterpillars eat my leaves away but i will remedy this gear ere long or sell my title for a glorious grave 'tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france and being protector stayed the soldiers' pay by means whereof his highness hath lost france in your protectorship you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of that england was defamed by tyranny so that by this you would not have him die 'tis york that hath more reason for his death but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk say as you think and speak it from your souls were 't not all one an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite as place duke humphrey for the king's protector and i and now we three have spoke it it skills not greatly who impugns our doom that somerset be sent as regent thither 'tis meet that lucky ruler be employed  witness the fortune he hath had in france no not to lose it all as thou hast done i rather would have lost my life betimes than bring a burden of dishonor home by staying there so long till all were lost show me one scar charactered on thy skin men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win what worse than naught nay then a shame take all i will my lord so please his majesty i am content provide me soldiers lords whiles i take order for mine own affairs my lord of suffolk within fourteen days at bristow i expect my soldiers for there i'll ship them all for ireland now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution be that thou hop'st to be or what thou art resign to death it is not worth th' enjoying let pale faced fear keep with the mean born man and find no harbor in a royal heart faster than springtime showers comes thought on thought and not a thought but thinks on dignity my brain more busy than the laboring spider weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies well nobles well 'tis politicly done to send me packing with an host of men i fear me you but warm the starv√®d snake who cherished in your breasts will sting your hearts 'twas men i lacked and you will give them me i take it kindly yet be well assured you put sharp weapons in a madman's hands whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band i will stir up in england some black storm shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage until the golden circuit on my head like to the glorious sun's transparent beams do calm the fury of this mad bred flaw and for a minister of my intent i have seduced a headstrong kentishman john cade of ashford to make commotion as full well he can under the title of john mortimer in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade oppose himself against a troop of kerns and fought so long till that his thighs with darts were almost like a sharp quilled porpentine and in the end being rescued i have seen him caper upright like a wild morisco shaking the bloody darts as he his bells full often like a shag haired crafty kern hath he convers√®d with the enemy and undiscovered come to me again and given me notice of their villainies this devil here shall be my substitute for that john mortimer which now is dead in face in gait in speech he doth resemble by this i shall perceive the commons' mind how they affect the house and claim of york say he be taken racked and tortur√®d i know no pain they can inflict upon him will make him say i moved him to those arms say that he thrive as 'tis great like he will why then from ireland come i with my strength and reap the harvest which that rascal sowed for humphrey being dead as he shall be and henry put apart the next for me from ireland thus comes york to claim his right and pluck the crown from feeble henry's head ring bells aloud burn bonfires clear and bright to entertain great england's lawful king ah sancta maiestas who would not buy thee dear let them obey that knows not how to rule this hand was made to handle naught but gold i cannot give due action to my words except a sword or scepter balance it a scepter shall it have have i a soul on which i'll toss the fleur de luce of france whom have we here buckingham to disturb me the king hath sent him sure i must dissemble humphrey of buckingham i accept thy greeting art thou a messenger or come of pleasure scarce can i speak my choler is so great o i could hew up rocks and fight with flint i am so angry at these abject terms and now like ajax telamonius on sheep or oxen could i spend my fury i am far better born than is the king more like a king more kingly in my thoughts but i must make fair weather yet awhile till henry be more weak and i more strong  buckingham i prithee pardon me that i have given no answer all this while my mind was troubled with deep melancholy the cause why i have brought this army hither is to remove proud somerset from the king seditious to his grace and to the state upon thine honor is he prisoner then buckingham i do dismiss my powers  soldiers i thank you all disperse yourselves meet me tomorrow in saint george's field you shall have pay and everything you wish and let my sovereign virtuous henry command my eldest son nay all my sons as pledges of my fealty and love i'll send them all as willing as i live lands goods horse armor anything i have is his to use so somerset may die in all submission and humility york doth present himself unto your highness to heave the traitor somerset from hence and fight against that monstrous rebel cade who since i heard to be discomfited how now is somerset at liberty then york unloose thy long imprisoned thoughts and let thy tongue be equal with thy heart shall i endure the sight of somerset  false king why hast thou broken faith with me knowing how hardly i can brook abuse king did i call thee no thou art not king not fit to govern and rule multitudes which dar'st not no nor canst not rule a traitor that head of thine doth not become a crown thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff and not to grace an awful princely scepter that gold must round engirt these brows of mine whose smile and frown like to achilles' spear is able with the change to kill and cure here is a hand to hold a scepter up and with the same to act controlling laws give place by heaven thou shalt rule no more o'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler wouldst have me kneel first let me ask of these if they can brook i bow a knee to man sirrah call in my sons to be my bail i know ere they will have me go to ward they'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement o blood bespotted neapolitan outcast of naples england's bloody scourge the sons of york thy betters in their birth shall be their father's bail and bane to those that for my surety will refuse the boys see where they come i'll warrant they'll make it good i thank thee clifford say what news with thee nay do not fright us with an angry look we are thy sovereign clifford kneel again for thy mistaking so we pardon thee will you not sons look in a glass and call thy image so i am thy king and thou a false heart traitor call hither to the stake my two brave bears that with the very shaking of their chains they may astonish these fell lurking curs bid salisbury and warwick come to me nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon call buckingham and all the friends thou hast i am resolved for death or dignity the deadly handed clifford slew my steed but match to match i have encountered him and made a prey for carrion kites and crows even of the bonny beast he loved so well hold warwick seek thee out some other chase for i myself must hunt this deer to death with thy brave bearing should i be in love but that thou art so fast mine enemy so let it help me now against thy sword as i in justice and true right express it a dreadful lay address thee instantly thus war hath given thee peace for thou art still peace with his soul heaven if it be thy will of salisbury who can report of him that winter lion who in rage forgets ag√®d contusions and all brush of time and like a gallant in the brow of youth repairs him with occasion this happy day is not itself nor have we won one foot if salisbury be lost i know our safety is to follow them for as i hear the king is fled to london to call a present court of parliament let us pursue him ere the writs go forth  what says lord warwick shall we after them
