enough for i will board her though she chide as loud as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack i know her father though i know not her and he knew my deceasèd father well i will not sleep hortensio till i see her and therefore let me be thus bold with you to give you over at this first encounter  unless you will accompany me thither peace sirrah i know she is an irksome brawling scold if that be

little din can daunt mine ears have i not in my time heard lions roar have i not heard the sea puffed up with winds rage like an angry boar chafèd with sweat have i not heard great ordnance in the field and heaven's artillery thunder in the skies have i not in a pitchèd battle heard loud 'larums neighing steeds and trumpets clang and do you tell me of a woman's tongue that gives not half so great a blow to hear as will a chestnut in a farmer's fire tush tush fear boys with bugs not her that chides sir at any hand i pray hortensio to what end are all these words sir sir the first's for me let her go by sir understand you this of me in sooth the youngest daughter whom you hearken for her father keeps from all access of suitors and will not promise her to any man until the elder sister

and for that dowry i'll assure her of her widowhood be it that she survive me in all my lands and leases whatsoever let specialties be therefore drawn between us that covenants may be kept on either hand why that is nothing for i tell you father i am as peremptory as she proud minded and where two raging fires meet together they do consume the thing that feeds their fury though little fire grows great with little wind yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all so i to her and so she yields to me for i am rough and woo not like a babe ay to the proof as mountains are for winds that shakes not though they blow perpetually now by the world it is a lusty wench i love her ten times more than ere i did o how i long to have some chat with her i pray you do i'll attend her here  and woo her with some spirit when she comes say that she rail why then i'll tell her plain she sings as sweetly as a nightingale say that she frown i'll say she looks as clear as morning roses newly washed with dew say she be mute and will not speak a word then i'll commend her volubility and say she uttereth piercing eloquence if she do bid me pack i'll give her thanks as though she bid me stay by her a week if she deny to wed i'll crave the day when i shall ask the banns and when be marrièd but here she comes and now petruchio speak good morrow kate for that's your name i hear you lie in faith for you are called plain kate and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst but kate the prettiest kate in christendom kate of kate hall my super dainty kate for dainties are all kates and therefore kate take this of me kate of my consolation hearing thy mildness praised in every town thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded yet not so deeply as to thee belongs myself am moved to woo thee for my wife why what's a movable thou hast hit it come sit on me women are made to bear and so are you alas good kate i will not burden thee for knowing thee to be but young and light  should be should buzz

world that talked of her have talked amiss of her if she be curst it is for policy for she's not froward but modest as the dove she is not hot but temperate as the morn for patience she will prove a second grissel and roman lucrece for her chastity and to conclude we have 'greed so well together that upon sunday is the wedding day be patient gentlemen i choose her for myself if she and i be pleased what's that to you 'tis bargained 'twixt us twain being alone that she shall still be curst in company i tell you 'tis incredible to believe how much she loves me o the kindest kate she hung

falcon now is sharp and passing empty and till she stoop she must not be full gorged for then she never looks upon her lure another way i have to man my haggard to make her come and know her keeper's call that is to watch her as we watch these kites that bate and beat and will not be obedient she ate no meat today nor none shall eat last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not as with the meat some undeservèd fault i'll find about the making of the bed and here i'll fling the pillow there the bolster this way the coverlet another way the sheets ay and amid this hurly i intend that all is done in reverend care of her and in conclusion she shall watch all night and if she chance to nod i'll rail and brawl and with the clamor keep her still awake this is a way to kill a wife with kindness and thus i'll curb her mad and headstrong humor he that knows better how to tame a shrew now let him speak 'tis charity to shew how fares my kate what sweeting all amort pluck up thy spirits look cheerfully upon me here love thou seest how diligent i am to dress thy meat myself and bring it thee i am sure sweet kate this kindness merits thanks what not a word nay then thou lov'st it not

good do it unto thy gentle heart kate eat apace and now my honey love will we return unto thy father's house and revel it as bravely as the best with silken coats and caps and golden rings with ruffs

body with his ruffling treasure come tailor let us see these ornaments lay forth the gown what news with you sir why this was molded on a porringer a velvet dish fie fie 'tis lewd and filthy why 'tis

body rich and as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds so honor peereth in the meanest habit what is the jay more precious than the lark because his feathers are more beautiful or is the adder better than the eel because his painted skin contents the eye o no good kate neither art thou the worse for this poor furniture and mean array if thou account'st it shame lay it on me and therefore

which we will propose twenty crowns i'll venture so much of my hawk or hound but twenty times so much upon my wife a match 'tis done how she's busy and she cannot come is that an answer i hope better
