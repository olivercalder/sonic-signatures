your arcite did not lose by 't for he that was thus good encountered yet his better i have heard two emulous philomels beat the ear o' th' night with their contentious throats now one the higher anon the other then again the first and by and by out breasted that the sense could not be judge between 'em so it fared good space between these kinsmen till heavens did make hardly one the winner wear

you the powerful venus well hath graced her altar and given you your love our master mars hath vouched his oracle and to arcite gave the grace of the contention so the deities have showed due justice bear this hence never fortune did play a subtler game the conquered triumphs the victor has the loss yet in the passage the gods have been most equal palamon your kinsman hath confessed the right o' th' lady did lie in you for you first saw her and even then proclaimed your fancy he restored her as your stol'n jewel and desired your spirit to send him hence forgiven the gods my justice take from my hand and they themselves become the executioners lead your lady off and call your lovers from the stage of death whom i adopt my friends a day or two let us look sadly and give grace unto the funeral of arcite in whose end the visages of bridegrooms we'll put on and smile with palamon for whom an hour but one hour since i was as dearly sorry as glad of arcite and am now as glad as for him sorry o you heavenly charmers what things you make of us for what we lack we laugh for what we have are sorry still are children in some kind let us be thankful for that which is and with you leave
