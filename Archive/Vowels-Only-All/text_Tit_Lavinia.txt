in peace and honor live lord titus long my noble lord and father live in fame lo at this tomb my tributary tears i render for my brethren's obsequies and at thy feet i kneel with tears of joy shed on this earth for thy return to rome o bless me here with thy victorious hand whose fortunes rome's best citizens applaud not i my lord sith true nobility warrants these words in princely courtesy i say no i have been broad awake two hours and more under your patience gentle empress 'tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning and to be doubted that your moor and you are singled forth to try experiments jove shield your husband from his hounds today 'tis pity they should take him for a stag and being intercepted in your sport great reason that my noble lord be rated for sauciness i pray you let us hence and let her joy her raven colored love this valley fits the purpose passing well ay for these slips have made him noted long good king to be so mightily abused ay come semiramis nay barbarous tamora for no name fits thy nature but thy own o tamora thou bearest a woman's face  sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word when did the tiger's young ones teach the dam o do not learn her wrath she taught it thee the milk thou suck'st from her did turn to marble even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny yet every mother breeds not sons alike do thou entreat her show a woman's pity 'tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark yet have i heard o could i find it now  the lion moved with pity did endure to have his princely paws pared all away some say that ravens foster forlorn children the whilst their own birds famish in their nests o be to me though thy hard heart say no nothing so kind but something pitiful o let me teach thee for my father's sake that gave thee life when well he might have slain thee be not obdurate open thy deaf ears o tamora be called a gentle queen and with thine own hands kill me in this place for 'tis not life that i have begged so long poor i was slain when bassianus died 'tis present death i beg and one thing more that womanhood denies my tongue to tell o keep me from their worse than killing lust and tumble me into some loathsome pit where never man's eye may behold my body do this and be a charitable murderer no grace no womanhood ah beastly creature the blot and enemy to our general name confusion fall
