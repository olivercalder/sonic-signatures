he is not with himself let us withdraw no man shed tears for noble mutius he lives in fame that died in virtue's cause my sight is very dull whate'er it bodes what art thou fallen what subtle hole is this whose mouth is covered with rude growing briers upon whose leaves are drops of new shed blood as fresh as morning dew distilled on flowers a very fatal place it seems to me speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall i am surpris√®d with an uncouth fear a chilling sweat o'erruns my trembling joints my heart suspects more than mine eye can see aaron is gone and my compassionate heart will not permit mine eyes once to behold the thing whereat it trembles by surmise o tell me who it is for ne'er till now was i a child to fear i know not what if it be dark how dost thou know 'tis he reach me thy hand that i may help thee out or wanting strength to do thee so much good i may be plucked into the swallowing womb of this deep pit poor bassianus' grave i have no strength to pluck thee to the brink thy hand once more i will not loose again till thou art here aloft or i below thou canst not come to me i come to thee
