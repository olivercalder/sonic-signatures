when daffodils begin to peer with heigh the doxy over the dale why then comes in the sweet o' the year for the red blood reigns in the winter's pale the white sheet bleaching on the hedge with heigh the sweet birds o how they sing doth set my pugging tooth an edge for a quart of ale is a dish for a king the lark that tirralirra chants with heigh with heigh the thrush and the jay are summer songs for me and my aunts while we lie tumbling in the hay i have served prince florizell and in my time wore three pile but now i am out of service but shall i go mourn for that my dear the pale moon shines by night and when i wander here and there i then do most go right if tinkers may have leave to live and bear the sow skin budget then my account i well may give and in the stocks avouch it my traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linen my father named me autolycus who being as i am littered under mercury was likewise a snapper up of unconsidered trifles with die and drab i purchased this caparison and my revenue is the silly cheat gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway beating and hanging are terrors to me for the life to come i sleep out the thought of it a prize a prize if the springe hold the cock's mine o that ever i was born o help me help me pluck but off these rags and then death death o sir the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes i have received which are mighty ones and millions i am robbed sir and beaten my money and apparel ta'en from me and these detestable things put upon me a footman sweet sir a footman o good sir tenderly o o good sir softly good sir i fear sir my shoulder blade is out softly dear sir good sir softly you ha' done me a charitable office no good sweet sir no i beseech you sir i have a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence unto whom i was going i shall there have money or anything i want offer me no money i pray you that kills my heart a fellow sir that i have known to go about with troll my dames i knew him once a servant of the prince i cannot tell good sir for which of his virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of the court vices i would say sir i know this man well he hath been since an ape bearer then a process server a bailiff then he compassed a motion of the prodigal son and married a tinker's wife within a mile where my land and living lies and having flown over many knavish professions he settled only in rogue some call him autolycus very true sir he sir he that's the rogue that put me into this apparel i must confess to you sir i am no fighter i am false of heart that way and that he knew i warrant him sweet sir much better than i was i can stand and walk i will even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman's no good faced sir no sweet sir prosper you sweet sir your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice i'll be with you at your sheep shearing too if i make not this cheat bring out another and the shearers prove sheep let me be unrolled and my name put in the book of virtue jog on jog on the footpath way and merrily hent the stile a a merry heart goes all the day your sad tires in a mile a lawn as white as driven snow cypress black as e'er was crow gloves as sweet as damask roses masks for faces and for noses bugle bracelet necklace amber perfume for a lady's chamber golden coifs and stomachers for my lads to give their dears pins and poking sticks of steel what maids lack from head to heel come buy of me come come buy come buy buy lads or else your lasses cry come buy and indeed sir there are cozeners abroad therefore it behooves men to be wary i hope so sir for i have about me many parcels of charge here's one to a very doleful tune how a usurer's wife was brought to bed of twenty moneybags at a burden and how she longed to eat adders' heads and toads carbonadoed very true and but a month old here's the midwife's name to 't one mistress taleporter and five or six honest wives that were present why should i carry lies abroad here's another ballad of a fish that appeared upon the coast on wednesday the fourscore of april forty thousand fathom above water and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids it was thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her the ballad is very pitiful and as true five justices' hands at it and witnesses more than my pack will hold this is a merry ballad but a very pretty one why this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of two maids wooing a man there's scarce a maid westward but she sings it 'tis in request i can tell you i can bear my part you must know 'tis my occupation have at it with you get you hence for i must go where it fits not you to know neither neither and you shall pay well for 'em will you buy any tape or lace for your cape my dainty duck my dear a any silk any thread any toys for your head of the new'st and fin'st fin'st wear a come to the peddler money's a meddler that doth utter all men's ware a ha ha what a fool honesty is and trust his sworn brother a very simple gentleman i have sold all my trumpery not a counterfeit stone not a ribbon glass pomander brooch table book ballad knife tape glove shoe tie bracelet horn ring to keep my pack from fasting they throng who should buy first as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer by which means i saw whose purse was best in picture and what i saw to my good use i remembered my clown who wants but something to be a reasonable man grew so in love with the wenches' song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket it was senseless 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse i could have filed keys off that hung in chains no hearing no feeling but my sir's song and admiring the nothing of it so that in this time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come in with a hubbub against his daughter and the king's son and scared my choughs from the chaff i had not left a purse alive in the whole army if they have overheard me now why hanging i am a poor fellow sir i am a poor fellow sir i know you well enough are you in earnest sir i smell the trick on 't indeed i have had earnest but i cannot with conscience take it adieu sir i understand the business i hear it to have an open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a cutpurse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for th' other senses i see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive what an exchange had this been without boot what a boot is here with this exchange sure the gods do this year connive at us and we may do anything extempore the prince himself is about a piece of iniquity stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels if i thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal i would not do 't i hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am i constant to my profession aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain every lane's end every shop church session hanging yields a careful man work very wisely puppies i know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master though i am not naturally honest i am so sometimes by chance let me pocket up my peddler's excrement how now rustics whither are you bound your affairs there what with whom the condition of that fardel the place of your dwelling your names your ages of what having breeding and anything that is fitting to be known discover a lie you are rough and hairy let me have no lying it becomes none but tradesmen and they often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore they do not give us the lie whether it like me or no i am a courtier seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings hath not my gait in it the measure of the court receives not thy nose court odor from me reflect i not on thy baseness court contempt think'st thou for that i insinuate and toze from thee thy business i am therefore no courtier i am courtier cap a pie and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there whereupon i command thee to open thy affair what advocate hast thou to him how blest are we that are not simple men yet nature might have made me as these are therefore i will not disdain the fardel there what's i' th' fardel wherefore that box age thou hast lost thy labor the king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for if thou beest capable of things serious thou must know the king is full of grief if that shepherd be not in handfast let him fly the curses he shall have the tortures he shall feel will break the back of man the heart of monster not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though removed fifty times shall all come under the hangman which though it be great pity yet it is necessary an old sheep whistling rogue a ram tender to offer to have his daughter come into grace some say he shall be stoned but that death is too soft for him say i draw our throne into a sheepcote all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy he has a son who shall be flayed alive then 'nointed over with honey set on the head of a wasps' nest then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead then recovered again with aqua vitae or some other hot infusion then raw as he is and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims shall he be set against a brick wall the sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he is to behold him with flies blown to death but what talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries are to be smiled at their offenses being so capital tell me for you seem to be honest plain men what you have to the king being something gently considered i'll bring you where he is aboard tender your persons to his presence whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits here is man shall do it after i have done what i promised well give me the moiety are you a party in this business o that's the case of the shepherd's son hang him he'll be made an example i will trust you walk before toward the seaside go on the right hand i will but look upon the hedge and follow you if i had a mind to be honest i see fortune would not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth i am courted now with a double occasion gold and a means to do the prince my master good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement i will bring these two moles these blind ones aboard him if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for being so far officious for i am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to 't to him will i present them there may be matter in it beseech you sir were you present at this relation i would most gladly know the issue of it now had i not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head i brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherd's daughter so he then took her to be  who began to be much seasick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscovered but 'tis all one to me for had i been the finder out of this secret it would not have relished among my other discredits here come those i have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune i know you are now sir a gentleman born i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults i have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master ay an it like your good worship i will prove so sir to my power
