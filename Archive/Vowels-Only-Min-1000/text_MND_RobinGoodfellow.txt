how now spirit whither wander you the king doth keep his revels here tonight take heed the queen come not within his sight for oberon is passing fell and wrath because that she as her attendant hath a lovely boy stolen from an indian king she never had so sweet a changeling and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train to trace the forests wild but she perforce withholds the lovèd boy crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy and now they never meet in grove or green by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen but they do square that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups and hide them there thou speakest aright i am that merry wanderer of the night i jest to oberon and make him smile when i a fat and bean fed horse beguile neighing in likeness of a filly foal and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab and when she drinks against her lips i bob and on her withered dewlap pour the ale the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale sometime for three foot stool mistaketh me then slip i from her bum down topples she and tailor cries and falls into a cough and then the whole choir hold their hips and loffe and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there but room fairy here comes oberon i remember i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes ay there it is fear not my lord your servant shall do so through the forest have i gone but athenian found i none on whose eyes i might approve this flower's force in stirring love night and silence who is here weeds of athens he doth wear this is he my master said despisèd the athenian maid and here the maiden sleeping sound on the dank and dirty ground pretty soul she durst not lie near this lack love this kill courtesy  churl upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe when thou wak'st let love forbid sleep his seat on thy eyelid so awake when i am gone for i must now to oberon what hempen homespuns have we swagg'ring here so near the cradle of the fairy queen what a play toward i'll be an auditor  an actor too perhaps if i see cause a stranger pyramus than e'er played here i'll follow you i'll lead you about a round through bog through bush through brake through brier sometime a horse i'll be sometime a hound a hog a headless bear sometime a fire and neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn my mistress with a monster is in love near to her close and consecrated bower while she was in her dull and sleeping hour a crew of patches rude mechanicals that work for bread upon athenian stalls were met together to rehearse a play intended for great theseus' nuptial day the shallowest thick skin of that barren sort who pyramus presented in their sport forsook his scene and entered in a brake when i did him at this advantage take an ass's noll i fixèd on his head anon his thisbe must be answerèd and forth my mimic comes when they him spy as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye or russet pated choughs many in sort rising and cawing at the gun's report sever themselves and madly sweep the sky so at his sight away his fellows fly and at our stamp here o'er and o'er one falls he murder cries and help from athens calls their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong made senseless things begin to do them wrong for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch i led them on in this distracted fear and left sweet pyramus translated there when in that moment so it came to pass titania waked and straightway loved an ass i took him sleeping that is finished too  and the athenian woman by his side that when he waked of force she must be eyed this is the woman but not this the man then fate o'errules that one man holding troth a million fail confounding oath on oath i go i go look how i go swifter than arrow from the tartar's bow captain of our fairy band helena is here at hand and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee shall we their fond pageant see lord what fools these mortals be then will two at once woo one that must needs be sport alone and those things do best please me that befall prepost'rously believe me king of shadows i mistook did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have 'nointed an athenian's eyes and so far am i glad it so did sort as this their jangling i esteem a sport my fairy lord this must be done with haste for night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast and yonder shines aurora's harbinger at whose approach ghosts wand'ring here and there troop home to churchyards damnèd spirits all that in crossways and floods have burial already to their wormy beds are gone for fear lest day should look their shames upon they willfully themselves exile from light and must for aye consort with black browed night up and down up and down i will lead them up and down i am feared in field and town goblin lead them up and down here comes one here villain drawn and ready where art thou follow me then to plainer ground thou coward art thou bragging to the stars telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars and wilt not come come recreant come thou child i'll whip thee with a rod he is defiled that draws a sword on thee follow my voice we'll try no manhood here ho ho ho coward why com'st thou not come hither i am here yet but three come one more two of both kinds makes up four here she comes curst and sad cupid is a knavish lad thus to make poor females mad on the ground sleep sound i'll apply to your eye gentle lover remedy when thou wak'st thou tak'st true delight in the sight of thy former lady's eye and the country proverb known that every man should take his own in your waking shall be shown jack shall have jill naught shall go ill the man shall have his mare again and all shall be well now when thou wak'st with thine own fool's eyes peep fairy king attend and mark i do hear the morning lark now the hungry lion roars and the wolf behowls the moon whilst the heavy plowman snores all with weary task fordone now the wasted brands do glow whilst the screech owl screeching loud puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud now it is the time of night that the graves all gaping wide every one lets forth his sprite in the church way paths to glide and we fairies that do run by the triple hecate's team from the presence of the sun following darkness like a dream now are frolic not a mouse shall disturb this hallowed house i am sent with broom before to sweep the dust behind the door if we shadows have offended think but this and all is mended that you have but slumbered here while these visions did appear and this weak and idle theme no more yielding but a dream gentles do not reprehend if you pardon we will mend and as i am an honest puck if we have unearnèd luck now to 'scape the serpent's tongue we will make amends ere long else the puck a liar call so good night unto you all give me your hands if we be friends and robin shall restore amends
