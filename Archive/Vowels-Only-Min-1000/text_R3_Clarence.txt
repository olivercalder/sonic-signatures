his majesty tend'ring my person's safety hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the tower because my name is george yea richard when i know for i protest as yet i do not but as i can learn he hearkens after prophecies and dreams and from the crossrow plucks the letter g and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be and for my name of george begins with g it follows in his thought that i am he these as i learn and such like toys as these hath moved his highness to commit me now by heaven i think there is no man secure but the queen's kindred and night walking heralds that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore heard you not what an humble suppliant lord hastings was to her for his delivery we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey i know it pleaseth neither of us well i must perforce farewell o i have passed a miserable night so full of fearful dreams of ugly sights that as i am a christian faithful man i would not spend another such a night though 'twere to buy a world of happy days so full of dismal terror was the time methoughts that i had broken from the tower and was embarked to cross to burgundy and in my company my brother gloucester who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches thence we looked toward england and cited up a thousand heavy times during the wars of york and lancaster that had befall'n us as we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him overboard into the tumbling billows of the main o lord methought what pain it was to drown what dreadful noise of waters in my ears what sights of ugly death within my eyes methoughts i saw a thousand fearful wracks a thousand men that fishes gnawed upon wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl inestimable stones unvalued jewels all scattered in the bottom of the sea some lay in dead men's skulls and in the holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept  as 'twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems that wooed the slimy bottom of the deep and mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by methought i had and often did i strive to yield the ghost but still the envious flood stopped in my soul and would not let it forth to find the empty vast and wand'ring air but smothered it within my panting bulk who almost burst to belch it in the sea no no my dream was lengthened after life o then began the tempest to my soul i passed methought the melancholy flood with that sour ferryman which poets write of unto the kingdom of perpetual night the first that there did greet my stranger soul was my great father in law renownèd warwick who spake aloud what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence and so he vanished then came wand'ring by a shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood and he shrieked out aloud clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence that stabbed me in the field by tewkesbury seize on him furies take him unto torment with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends environed me and howlèd in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i trembling waked and for a season after could not believe but that i was in hell such terrible impression made my dream ah keeper keeper i have done these things that now give evidence against my soul for edward's sake and see how he requites me  o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds yet execute thy wrath in me alone o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children  keeper i prithee sit by me awhile my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine in god's name what art thou but not as i am royal thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak your eyes do menace me why look you pale who sent you hither wherefore do you come to murder me you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it wherein my friends have i offended you i shall be reconciled to him again are you drawn forth among a world of men to slay the innocent what is my offense where is the evidence that doth accuse me what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge or who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor clarence' death before i be convict by course of law to threaten me with death is most unlawful i charge you as you hope to have redemption by christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins that you depart and lay no hands on me the deed you undertake is damnable erroneous vassals the great king of kings hath in the table of his law commanded that thou shalt do no murder will you then spurn at his edict and fulfill a man's take heed for he holds vengeance in his hand to hurl upon their heads that break his law alas for whose sake did i that ill deed for edward for my brother for his sake he sends you not to murder me for this for in that sin he is as deep as i if god will be avengèd for the deed o know you yet he doth it publicly take not the quarrel from his powerful arm he needs no indirect or lawless course to cut off those that have offended him my brother's love the devil and my rage if you do love my brother hate not me i am his brother and i love him well if you are hired for meed go back again and i will send you to my brother gloucester who shall reward you better for my life than edward will for tidings of my death o no he loves me and he holds me dear go you to him from me tell him when that our princely father york blessed his three sons with his victorious arm he little thought of this divided friendship bid gloucester think of this and he will weep o do not slander him for he is kind it cannot be for he bewept my fortune and hugged me in his arms and swore with sobs that he would labor my delivery have you that holy feeling in your souls to counsel me to make my peace with god and are you yet to your own souls so blind that you will war with god by murd'ring me o sirs consider they that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed relent and save your souls which of you if you were a prince's son being pent from liberty as i am now  if two such murderers as yourselves came to you would not entreat for life ay you would beg were you in my distress not to relent is beastly savage devilish my friend i spy some pity in thy looks o if thine eye be not a flatterer come thou on my side and entreat for me a begging prince what beggar pities not let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow i that was washed to death with fulsome wine poor clarence by thy guile betrayed to death tomorrow in the battle think on me and fall thy edgeless sword despair and die thou offspring of the house of lancaster the wrongèd heirs of york do pray for thee good angels guard thy battle live and flourish
