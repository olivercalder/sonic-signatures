there's wood enough within as wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed with raven's feather from unwholesome fen drop on you both a southwest blow on you and blister you all o'er i must eat my dinner this island's mine by sycorax my mother which thou tak'st from me when thou cam'st first thou strok'st me and made much of me wouldst give me water with berries in 't and teach me how to name the bigger light and how the less that burn by day and night and then i loved thee and showed thee all the qualities o' th' isle the fresh springs brine pits barren place and fertile cursed be i that did so all the charms of sycorax toads beetles bats light on you for i am all the subjects that you have which first was mine own king and here you sty me in this hard rock whiles you do keep from me the rest o' th' island o ho o ho would 't had been done thou didst prevent me i had peopled else this isle with calibans you taught me language and my profit on 't is i know how to curse the red plague rid you for learning me your language no pray thee i must obey his art is of such power it would control my dam's god setebos and make a vassal of him all the infections that the sun sucks up from bogs fens flats on prosper fall and make him by inchmeal a disease his spirits hear me and yet i needs must curse but they'll nor pinch fright me with urchin shows pitch me i' th' mire nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark out of my way unless he bid 'em but for every trifle are they set upon me sometimes like apes that mow and chatter at me and after bite me then like hedgehogs which lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount their pricks at my footfall sometime am i all wound with adders who with cloven tongues do hiss me into madness lo now lo here comes a spirit of his and to torment me for bringing wood in slowly i'll fall flat perchance he will not mind me do not torment me o the spirit torments me o do not torment me prithee i'll bring my wood home faster thou dost me yet but little hurt thou wilt anon i know it by thy trembling now prosper works upon thee these be fine things an if they be not sprites that's a brave god and bears celestial liquor i will kneel to him i'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject for the liquor is not earthly hast thou not dropped from heaven i have seen thee in her and i do adore thee my mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush i'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island and i will kiss thy foot i prithee be my god i'll kiss thy foot i'll swear myself thy subject i'll show thee the best springs i'll pluck thee berries i'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough a plague upon the tyrant that i serve i'll bear him no more sticks but follow thee thou wondrous man i prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow and i with my long nails will dig thee pignuts show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how to snare the nimble marmoset i'll bring thee to clustering filberts and sometimes i'll get thee young scamels from the rock wilt thou go with me farewell master farewell farewell no more dams i'll make for fish nor fetch in firing at requiring nor scrape trenchering nor wash dish 'ban 'ban ca caliban has a new master get a new man freedom high day high day freedom freedom high day freedom how does thy honor let me lick thy shoe i'll not serve him he is not valiant lo how he mocks me wilt thou let him my lord lo lo again bite him to death i prithee i thank my noble lord wilt thou be pleased to harken once again to the suit i made to thee as i told thee before i am subject to a tyrant a sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island thou liest thou jesting monkey thou i would my valiant master would destroy thee i do not lie i say by sorcery he got this isle from me he got it if thy greatness will revenge it on him for i know thou dar'st but this thing dare not thou shalt be lord of it and i'll serve thee yea yea my lord i'll yield him thee asleep where thou mayst knock a nail into his head what a pied ninny's this thou scurvy patch  i do beseech thy greatness give him blows and take his bottle from him when that's gone he shall drink naught but brine for i'll not show him where the quick freshes are ha ha ha beat him enough after a little time i'll beat him too why as i told thee 'tis a custom with him i' th' afternoon to sleep there thou mayst brain him having first seized his books or with a log batter his skull or paunch him with a stake or cut his weasand with thy knife remember first to possess his books for without them he's but a sot as i am nor hath not one spirit to command they all do hate him as rootedly as i burn but his books he has brave utensils for so he calls them  which when he has a house he'll deck withal and that most deeply to consider is the beauty of his daughter he himself calls her a nonpareil i never saw a woman but only sycorax my dam and she but she as far surpasseth sycorax as great'st does least ay lord she will become thy bed i warrant and bring thee forth brave brood within this half hour will he be asleep wilt thou destroy him then thou mak'st me merry i am full of pleasure let us be jocund will you troll the catch you taught me but whilere that's not the tune art thou afeard be not afeard the isle is full of noises sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears and sometimes voices that if i then had waked after long sleep will make me sleep again and then in dreaming the clouds methought would open and show riches ready to drop upon me that when i waked i cried to dream again when prospero is destroyed pray you tread softly that the blind mole may not hear a footfall we now are near his cell good my lord give me thy favor still be patient for the prize i'll bring thee to shall hoodwink this mischance therefore speak softly all's hushed as midnight yet prithee my king be quiet seest thou here this is the mouth o' th' cell no noise and enter do that good mischief which may make this island thine own forever and i thy caliban for aye thy foot licker let it alone thou fool it is but trash the dropsy drown this fool what do you mean to dote thus on such luggage let 't alone and do the murder first if he awake from toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches make us strange stuff i will have none on 't we shall lose our time and all be turned to barnacles or to apes with foreheads villainous low o setebos these be brave spirits indeed how fine my master is i am afraid he will chastise me i shall be pinched to death ay that i will and i'll be wise hereafter and seek for grace what a thrice double ass was i to take this drunkard for a god and worship this dull fool
