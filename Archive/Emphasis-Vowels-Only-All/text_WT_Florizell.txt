bless the time when my good falcon made her flight across thy father's ground apprehend nothing but jollity the gods themselves humbling their deities to love have taken the shapes of beasts upon them jupiter became a bull and bellowed the green neptune a ram and bleated and the fire robed god golden apollo a poor humble swain as i seem now their transformations were never for a piece of beauty rarer nor in a way so chaste since my desires run not before mine honor nor my lusts burn hotter than my faith thou dear'st perdita with these forced thoughts i prithee darken not the mirth o' th' feast or i'll be thine my fair or not my father's for i cannot be mine own nor anything to any if i be not thine to this i am most constant though destiny say no be merry gentle strangle such thoughts as these with anything that you behold the while your guests are coming lift up your countenance as it were the day of celebration of that nuptial which we two have sworn shall come see your guests approach address yourself to entertain them sprightly and let's be red with mirth what like a corse what you do still betters what is done when you speak sweet i'd have you do it ever when you sing i'd have you buy and sell so so give alms pray so and for the ord'ring your affairs to sing them too when you do dance i wish you a wave o' th' sea that you might ever do nothing but that move still still so and own no other function each your doing so singular in each particular crowns what you are doing in the present deeds that all your acts are queens i think you have as little skill to fear as i have purpose to put you to 't but come our dance i pray your hand my perdita so turtles pair that never mean to part old sir i know she prizes not such trifles as these are the gifts she looks from me are packed and locked up in my heart which i have given already but not delivered o hear me breathe my life before this ancient sir who it should seem hath sometime loved i take thy hand this hand as soft as dove's down and as white as it or ethiopian's tooth or the fanned snow that's bolted by th' northern blasts twice o'er do and be witness to 't and he and more than he and men the earth the heavens and all  that were i crowned the most imperial monarch thereof most worthy were i the fairest youth that ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge more than was ever man's i would not prize them without her love for her employ them all commend them and condemn them to her service or to their own perdition o that must be i' th' virtue of your daughter one being dead i shall have more than you can dream of yet enough then for your wonder but come on contract us fore these witnesses i have but what of him he neither does nor shall no good sir he has his health and ampler strength indeed than most have of his age i yield all this but for some other reasons my grave sir which 'tis not fit you know i not acquaint my father of this business he shall not no he must not come come he must not mark our contract why look you so upon me i am but sorry not afeard delayed but nothing altered what i was i am more straining on for plucking back not following my leash unwillingly i not purpose it i think camillo it cannot fail but by the violation of my faith and then let nature crush the sides o' th' earth together and mar the seeds within lift up thy looks from my succession wipe me father i am heir to my affection i am and by my fancy if my reason will thereto be obedient i have reason if not my senses better pleased with madness do bid it welcome so call it but it does fulfill my vow i needs must think it honesty camillo not for bohemia nor the pomp that may be thereat gleaned for all the sun sees or the close earth wombs or the profound seas hides in

your good counsels upon his passion let myself and fortune tug for the time to come this you may know and so deliver i am put to sea with her who here i cannot hold on shore and most opportune to our need i have a vessel rides fast by but not prepared for this design what course i mean to hold shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor concern me the reporting hark perdita  i'll hear you by and by

recompensed as thought on how camillo may this almost a miracle be done that i may call thee something more than man and after that trust to thee not any yet but as th' unthought on accident is guilty to what we wildly do so we profess ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies of every wind that blows worthy camillo what color for my visitation shall i hold up before him i am bound to you
