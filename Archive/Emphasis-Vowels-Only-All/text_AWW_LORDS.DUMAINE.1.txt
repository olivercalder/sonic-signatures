malice but to speak of him as my kinsman he's a most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly promise breaker the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment i with a troop of florentines will suddenly surprise him such i will have whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy we will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversary's when we bring him to our own tents be but your lordship present at his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my judgment in anything o for the love of laughter hinder not the honor of his design let him fetch off his drum in any hand no more than a fish loves water is not this a strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems to undertake this business which he knows is not to be done damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to do 't none in the world but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies but we have almost embossed him you shall see his fall tonight for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect i must go look my twigs he shall be caught as 't please your lordship i'll leave you he can come no other way but by this hedge corner when you sally upon him speak what terrible language you will though you understand it not yourselves no matter for we must not seem to understand him unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter art not acquainted with him knows he not thy voice but what linsey woolsey hast thou to speak to us again he must think us some band of strangers i' th' adversary's entertainment now he hath a smack of all neighboring languages therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy not to know what we speak one to another so we seem to know is to know straight our purpose choughs' language gabble enough and good enough as for you interpreter you must seem very politic but couch ho here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he forges this is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of is it possible he should know what he is and be that he is we cannot afford you so 'twould not do hardly serve how deep three great oaths would scarce make that be believed you shall hear one anon throca movousus cargo cargo cargo oscorbidulchos voliuorco go tell the count rossillion and my

given him his mother's letter he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady when you have spoken it 'tis dead and i am the grave of it now god delay our rebellion as we are ourselves what things are we is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents we shall not then have his company tonight that approaches apace i would gladly have him see his company anatomized that he might take a measure of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit in the meantime what hear you of these wars nay i assure you a peace concluded i perceive by this demand you are not altogether of his counsel sir his wife some two months since fled from his house her pretense is a pilgrimage to saint jaques le grand which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished and there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and now she sings in

the rector of the place ay and the particular confirmations point from point to the full arming of the verity how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill together our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues how now where's your master hush
