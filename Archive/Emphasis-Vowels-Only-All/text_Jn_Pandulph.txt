hail you anointed deputies of heaven to thee king john my holy errand is i pandulph of fair milan cardinal and from pope innocent the legate here do in his name religiously demand why thou against the church our holy mother so willfully dost spurn and force perforce keep stephen langton chosen archbishop of canterbury from that holy see this in our foresaid holy father's name pope innocent i do demand of thee then by the lawful power that i have thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate and blessèd shall he be that doth revolt from his allegiance to an heretic and meritorious shall that hand be called canonizèd and worshiped as a saint that takes away by any secret course thy hateful life there's law and warrant lady for my curse philip of france on peril of a curse let go the hand of that arch heretic and raise the power of france upon his head unless he do submit himself to rome what canst thou say but will perplex thee more if thou stand excommunicate and cursed all form is formless order orderless save what is opposite to england's love therefore to arms be champion of our church or let the church our mother breathe her curse a mother's curse on her revolting son france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue a chafèd lion by the mortal paw a fasting tiger safer by the tooth than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold so mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith and like a civil war sett'st oath to oath thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow first made to god first be to god performed that is to be the champion of our church what since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself and may not be performèd by thyself for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss is not amiss when it is truly done and being not done where doing tends to ill the truth is then most done not doing it the better act of purposes mistook is to mistake again though indirect yet indirection thereby grows direct and falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire within the scorchèd veins of one new burned it is religion that doth make vows kept but thou hast sworn against religion by what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st and mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth against an oath the truth thou art unsure to swear swears only not to be forsworn else what a mockery should it be to swear but thou dost swear only to be forsworn and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear therefore thy later vows against thy first is in thyself rebellion to thyself and better conquest never canst thou make than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts against these giddy loose suggestions upon which better part our prayers come in if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know the peril of our curses light on thee so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off but in despair die under their black weight i will denounce a curse upon his head courage and comfort all shall yet go well lady you utter madness and not sorrow you hold too heinous a respect of grief before the curing of a strong disease even in the instant of repair and health the fit is strongest evils that take leave on their departure most of all show evil what have you lost by losing of this day if you had won it certainly you had no no when fortune means to men most good she looks upon them with a threat'ning eye 'tis strange to think how much king john hath lost in this which he accounts so clearly won are not you grieved that arthur is his prisoner your mind is all as youthful as your blood now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit for even the breath of what i mean to speak shall blow each dust each straw each little rub out of the path which shall directly lead thy foot to england's throne and therefore mark john hath seized arthur and it cannot be that whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins the misplaced john should entertain an hour one minute nay one quiet breath of rest a scepter snatched with an unruly hand must be as boisterously maintained as gained and he that stands upon a slipp'ry place makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up that john may stand then arthur needs must fall so be it for it cannot be but so you in the right of lady blanche your wife may then make all the claim that arthur did how green you are and fresh in this old world john lays you plots the times conspire with you for he that steeps his safety in true blood shall find but bloody safety and untrue this act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts of all his people and freeze up their zeal that none so small advantage shall step forth to check his reign but they will cherish it no natural exhalation in the sky no scope of nature no distempered day no common wind no customèd event but they will pluck away his natural cause and call them meteors prodigies and signs abortives presages and tongues of heaven plainly denouncing vengeance upon john o sir when he shall hear of your approach if that young arthur be not gone already even at that news he dies and then the hearts of all his people shall revolt from him and kiss the lips of unacquainted change and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath out of the bloody fingers' ends of john methinks i see this hurly all on foot and o what better matter breeds for you than i have named the bastard faulconbridge is now in england ransacking the church offending charity if but a dozen french were there in arms they would be as a call to train ten thousand english to their side or as a little snow tumbled about anon becomes a mountain o noble dauphin go with me to the king 'tis wonderful what may be wrought out of their discontent now that their souls are topful of offense for england go i will whet on the king take again from this my hand as holding of the pope your sovereign greatness and authority it was my breath that blew this tempest up upon your stubborn usage of the pope but since you are a gentle convertite my tongue shall hush again this storm of war and make fair weather in your blust'ring land on this ascension day remember well upon your oath of service to the pope go i to make the french lay down their arms hail noble prince of france the next is this king john hath reconciled himself to rome his spirit is come in that so stood out against the holy church the great metropolis and see of rome therefore thy threat'ning colors now wind up and tame the savage spirit of wild war that like a lion fostered up at hand it may lie gently at the foot of peace and be no further harmful than in show you look but on the outside of this work the dauphin is too willful opposite and will not temporize with my entreaties he flatly says he'll not lay down his arms give me leave to speak
