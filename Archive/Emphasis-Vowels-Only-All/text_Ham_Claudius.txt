though yet of hamlet our dear brother's death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th' imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as 'twere with a defeated joy with an auspicious and a dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barred your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother's death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleaguèd with this dream of his advantage he hath not failed to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears of this his nephew's purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell and now laertes what's the news with you you told us of some suit what is 't laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes have you your father's leave what says polonius take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will  but now my cousin hamlet and my son  how is it that the clouds still hang on you 'tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness 'tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschooled for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie 'tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son why 'tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again respeaking earthly thunder come away welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet's transformation so call it sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father's death that thus hath put him so much from th' understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and sith so neighbored to his youth and havior that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that opened lies within our remedy thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thou still hast been the father of good news o speak of that that do i long to hear thyself do grace to them and bring them in he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found the head and source of all your son's distemper well we shall sift him welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway it likes us well and at our more considered time we'll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labor go to your rest at night we'll feast together most welcome home but how hath she received his love as of a man faithful and honorable do you think 'tis this not that i know how may we try it further we will try it and can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose into these delights sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as 'twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behaved if 't be th' affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for o 'tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot's cheek beautied with plast'ring art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lacked form a little was not like madness there's something in his soul o'er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on 't it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatched go how fares our cousin hamlet i have nothing with this answer hamlet these words are not mine have you heard the argument is there no offense in 't what do you call the play give me some light away i like him not nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range therefore prepare you i your commission will forthwith dispatch and he to england shall along with you the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so near 's as doth hourly grow out of his brows arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage for we will fetters put about this fear which now goes too free footed thanks dear my lord o my offense is rank it smells to heaven it hath the primal eldest curse upon 't a brother's murder pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and like a man to double business bound i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect what if this cursèd hand were thicker than itself with brother's blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offense and what's in prayer but this twofold force to be forestallèd ere we come to fall or pardoned being down then i'll look up my fault is past but o what form of prayer can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder that cannot be since i am still possessed of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen may one be pardoned and retain th' offense in the corrupted currents of this world offense's gilded hand may shove by justice and oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law but 'tis not so above there is no shuffling there the action lies in his true nature and we ourselves compelled even to the teeth and forehead of our faults to give in evidence what then what rests try what repentance can what can it not yet what can it when one cannot repent o wretched state o bosom black as death o limèd soul that struggling to be free art more engaged help angels make assay bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel be soft as sinews of the newborn babe all may be well my words fly up my thoughts remain below words without thoughts never to heaven go there's matter in these sighs these profound heaves you must translate 'tis fit we understand them where is your son what gertrude how does hamlet o heavy deed it had been so with us had we been there his liberty is full of threats to all  to you yourself to us to everyone alas how shall this bloody deed be answered it will be laid to us whose providence should have kept short restrained and out of haunt this mad young man but so much was our love we would not understand what was most fit but like the owner of a foul disease to keep it from divulging let it feed even on the pith of life where is he gone o gertrude come away the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch but we will ship him hence and this vile deed we must with all our majesty and skill both countenance and excuse ho guildenstern friends both go join you with some further aid hamlet in madness hath polonius slain and from his mother's closet hath he dragged him go seek him out speak fair and bring the body into the chapel i pray you haste in this come gertrude we'll call up our wisest friends and let them know both what we mean to do and what's untimely done whose whisper o'er the world's diameter as level as the cannon to his blank transports his poisoned shot may miss our name and hit the woundless air o come away my soul is full of discord and dismay i have sent to seek him and to find the body how dangerous is it that this man goes loose yet must not we put the strong law on him he's loved of the distracted multitude who like not in their judgment but their eyes and where 'tis so th' offender's scourge is weighed but never the offense to bear all smooth and even this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate pause diseases desperate grown by desperate appliance are relieved or not at all how now what hath befallen but where is he bring him before us now hamlet where's polonius at supper where alas alas what dost thou mean by this where is polonius go seek him there hamlet this deed for thine especial safety which we do tender as we dearly grieve for that which thou hast done must send thee hence with fiery quickness therefore prepare thyself the bark is ready and the wind at help th' associates tend and everything is bent for england ay hamlet so is it if thou knew'st our purposes thy loving father hamlet follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard delay it not i'll have him hence tonight away for everything is sealed and done that else leans on th' affair pray you make haste and england if my love thou hold'st at aught as my great power thereof may give thee sense since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red after the danish sword and thy free awe pays homage to us thou mayst not coldly set our sovereign process which imports at full by letters congruing to that effect the present death of hamlet do it england for like the hectic in my blood he rages and thou must cure me till i know 'tis done howe'er my haps my joys will ne'er begin how do you pretty lady conceit upon her father pretty ophelia  how long hath she been thus follow her close give her good watch i pray you o this is the poison of deep grief it springs all from her father's death and now behold o gertrude gertrude when sorrows come they come not single spies but in battalions first her father slain next your son gone and he most violent author of his own just remove the people muddied thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers for good polonius' death and we have done but greenly in hugger mugger to inter him poor ophelia divided from herself and her fair judgment without the which we are pictures or mere beasts last and as much containing as all these her brother is in secret come from france feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds and wants not buzzers to infect his ear with pestilent speeches of his father's death wherein necessity of matter beggared will nothing stick our person to arraign in ear and ear o my dear gertrude this like to a murd'ring piece in many places gives me superfluous death attend where is my switzers let them guard the door what is the matter the doors are broke what is the cause laertes that thy rebellion looks so giant like  let him go gertrude do not fear our person there's such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would acts little of his will tell me laertes why thou art thus incensed let him go gertrude  speak man dead let him demand his fill who shall stay you good laertes if you desire to know the certainty of your dear father is 't writ in your revenge that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe winner and loser will you know them then why now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman that i am guiltless of your father's death and am most sensibly in grief for it it shall as level to your judgment 'pear as day does to your eye laertes i must commune with your grief or you deny me right go but apart make choice of whom your wisest friends you will and they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me if by direct or by collateral hand they find us touched we will our kingdom give our crown our life and all that we call ours to you in satisfaction but if not be you content to lend your patience to us and we shall jointly labor with your soul to give it due content so you shall and where th' offense is let the great ax fall i pray you go with me now must your conscience my acquittance seal and you must put me in your heart for friend sith you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed but yet to me they're strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which she is so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection work like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timbered for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again but not where i have aimed them break not your sleeps for that you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more i loved your father and we love ourself and that i hope will teach you to imagine  how now what news from hamlet who brought them laertes you shall hear them  leave us high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom tomorrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return hamlet what should this mean are all the rest come back or is it some abuse and no such thing 'tis hamlet's character naked  and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise me if it be so laertes as how should it be so how otherwise will you be ruled by me to thine own peace if he be now returned as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to an exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practice and call it accident it falls right you have been talked of since your travel much and that in hamlet's hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege a very ribbon in the cap of youth  yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy i have seen myself and served against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft in 't he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as had he been encorpsed and demi natured with the brave beast so far he topped my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did a norman the very same he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defense and for your rapier most especial that he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the 'scrimers of their nation he swore had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposed them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming o'er to play with you now out of this  laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a pleurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick of th' ulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself indeed your father's son more than in words no place indeed should murder sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber hamlet returned shall know you are come home we'll put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practice requite him for your father let's further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance 'twere better not assayed therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this did blast in proof soft let me see we'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings  i ha 't when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink i'll have prepared him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping if he by chance escape your venomed stuck our purpose may hold there but stay what noise let's follow gertrude how much i had to do to calm his rage now fear i this will give it start again therefore let's follow pluck them asunder o he is mad laertes i pray thee good horatio wait upon him strengthen your patience in our last night's speech we'll put the matter to the present push  good gertrude set some watch over your son  this grave shall have a living monument an hour of quiet thereby shall we see till then in patience our proceeding be come hamlet come and take this hand from me give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet you know the wager i do not fear it i have seen you both but since he is better we have therefore odds set me the stoups of wine upon that table  if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmark's crown have worn give me the cups and let the kettle to the trumpet speak the trumpet to the cannoneer without the cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth now the king drinks to hamlet come begin and you the judges bear a wary eye stay give me drink hamlet this pearl is thine here's to thy health give him the cup our son shall win gertrude do not drink it is the poisoned cup it is too late i do not think 't part them they are incensed she swoons to see them bleed o yet defend me friends i am but hurt
