wilt thou be gone sweet valentine adieu think on thy proteus when thou haply seest some rare noteworthy object in thy travel wish me partaker in thy happiness when thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger if ever danger do environ thee commend thy grievance to my holy prayers for i will be thy beadsman valentine upon some book i love i'll pray for thee that's a deep story of a deeper love for he was more than over shoes in love over the boots nay give me not the boots what so by your circumstance you call me fool 'tis love you cavil at i am not love yet writers say as in the sweetest bud the eating canker dwells so eating love inhabits in the finest wits of all and thither will i bring thee valentine all happiness bechance to thee in milan he after honor hunts i after love he leaves his friends to dignify them more i leave myself my friends and all for love thou julia thou hast metamorphosed me made me neglect my studies lose my time war with good counsel set the world at nought made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought but now he parted hence to embark for milan indeed a sheep doth very often stray an if the shepherd be awhile away i do a silly answer and fitting well a sheep true and thy master a shepherd it shall go hard but i'll prove it by another the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep but dost thou hear gav'st thou my letter to julia here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons nay in that you are astray 'twere best pound you you mistake i mean the pound a pinfold but what said she nod ay why that's noddy and that set together is noddy no no you shall have it for bearing the letter why sir how do you bear with me beshrew me but you have a quick wit come come open the matter in brief what said she well sir here is for your pains what said she why couldst thou perceive so much from her what said she nothing go go begone to save your ship from wrack which cannot perish having thee aboard being destined to a drier death on shore i must go send some better messenger i fear my julia would not deign my lines receiving them from such a worthless post sweet love sweet lines sweet life here is her hand the agent of her heart here is her oath for love her honor's pawn o that our fathers would applaud our loves to seal our happiness with their consents o heavenly julia may 't please your lordship 'tis a word or two of commendations sent from valentine delivered by a friend that came from him there is no news my lord but that he writes how happily he lives how well beloved and daily gracèd by the emperor wishing me with him partner of his fortune as one relying on your lordship's will and not depending on his friendly wish my lord i cannot be so soon provided please you deliberate a day or two thus have i shunned the fire for fear of burning and drenched me in the sea where i am drowned i feared to show my father julia's letter lest he should take exceptions to my love and with the vantage of mine own excuse hath he excepted most against my love o how this spring of love resembleth the uncertain glory of an april day which now shows all the beauty of the sun and by and by a cloud takes all away why this it is my heart accords thereto and yet a thousand times it answers no have patience gentle julia when possibly i can i will return why then we'll make exchange here take you this here is my hand for my true constancy and when that hour o'erslips me in the day wherein i sigh not julia for thy sake the next ensuing hour some foul mischance torment me for my love's forgetfulness my father stays my coming answer not the tide is now nay not thy tide of tears that tide will stay me longer than i should julia farewell what gone without a word ay so true love should do it cannot speak for truth hath better deeds than words to grace it go i come i come alas this parting strikes poor lovers dumb not so sweet lady but too mean a servant to have a look of such a worthy mistress my duty will i boast of nothing else i'll die on him that says so but yourself that you are worthless we'll both attend upon your ladyship your friends are well and have them much commended i left them all in health my tales of love were wont to weary you i know you joy not in a love discourse enough i read your fortune in your eye was this the idol that you worship so no but she is an earthly paragon i will not flatter her when i was sick you gave me bitter pills and i must minister the like to you except my mistress have i not reason to prefer mine own why valentine what braggartism is this then let her alone but she loves you go on before i shall inquire you forth i must unto the road to disembark some necessaries that i needs must use and then i'll presently attend you i will even as one heat another heat expels or as one nail by strength drives out another so the remembrance of my former love is by a newer object quite forgotten is it mine eye or valentine's praise her true perfection or my false transgression that makes me reasonless to reason thus she is fair and so is julia that i love  that i did love for now my love is thawed which like a waxen image 'gainst a fire bears no impression of the thing it was methinks my zeal to valentine is cold and that i love him not as i was wont o but i love his lady too too much and that's the reason i love him so little how shall i dote on her with more advice that thus without advice begin to love her 'tis but her picture i have yet beheld and that hath dazzled my reason's light but when i look on her perfections there is no reason but i shall be blind if i can check my erring love i will if not to compass her i'll use my skill to leave my julia shall i be forsworn to love fair sylvia shall i be forsworn to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn and ev'n that power which gave me first my oath provokes me to this threefold perjury love bade me swear and love bids me forswear o sweet suggesting love if thou hast sinned teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it at first i did adore a twinkling star but now i worship a celestial sun unheedful vows may heedfully be broken and he wants wit that wants resolvèd will to learn his wit t' exchange the bad for better fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferred with twenty thousand soul confirming oaths i cannot leave to love and yet i do but there i leave to love where i should love julia i lose and valentine i lose if i keep them i needs must lose myself if i lose them thus find i by their loss for valentine myself for julia sylvia i to myself am dearer than a friend for love is still most precious in itself and sylvia witness heaven that made her fair  shows julia but a swarthy ethiope i will forget that julia is alive rememb'ring that my love to her is dead and valentine i'll hold an enemy aiming at sylvia as a sweeter friend i cannot now prove constant to myself without some treachery used to valentine this night he meaneth with a corded ladder to climb celestial sylvia's chamber window myself in counsel his competitor now presently i'll give her father notice of their disguising and pretended flight who all enraged will banish valentine for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter but valentine being gone i'll quickly cross by some sly trick blunt thurio's dull proceeding love lend me wings to make my purpose swift as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift my gracious lord that which i would discover the law of friendship bids me to conceal but when i call to mind your gracious favors done to me undeserving as i am my duty pricks me on to utter that which else no worldly good should draw from me know worthy prince sir valentine my friend this night intends to steal away your daughter myself am one made privy to the plot i know you have determined to bestow her on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates and should she thus be stol'n away from you it would be much vexation to your age thus for my duty's sake i rather chose to cross my friend in his intended drift than by concealing it heap on your head a pack of sorrows which would press you down being unprevented to your timeless grave know noble lord they have devised a mean how he her chamber window will ascend and with a corded ladder fetch her down for which the youthful lover now is gone and this way comes he with it presently where if it please you you may intercept him but good my lord do it so cunningly that my discovery be not aimèd at for love of you not hate unto my friend hath made me publisher of this pretense adieu my lord sir valentine is coming run boy run run and seek him out what seest thou valentine who then his spirit what then who wouldst thou strike villain forbear sirrah i say forbear friend valentine a word then in dumb silence will i bury mine for they are harsh untunable and bad no valentine no valentine that thou art banishèd o that's the news  from hence from sylvia and from me thy friend ay ay and she hath offered to the doom  which unreversed stands in effectual force  a sea of melting pearl which some call tears those at her father's churlish feet she tendered with them upon her knees her humble self wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them as if but now they waxèd pale for woe but neither bended knees pure hands held up sad sighs deep groans nor silver shedding tears could penetrate her uncompassionate sire but valentine if he be ta'en must die besides her intercession chafed him so when she for thy repeal was suppliant that to close prison he commanded her with many bitter threats of biding there cease to lament for that thou canst not help and study help for that which thou lament'st time is the nurse and breeder of all good here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love besides thy staying will abridge thy life hope is a lover's staff walk hence with that and manage it against despairing thoughts thy letters may be here though thou art hence which being writ to me shall be delivered even in the milk white bosom of thy love the time now serves not to expostulate come i'll convey thee through the city gate and ere i part with thee confer at large of all that may concern thy love affairs as thou lov'st sylvia though not for thyself regard thy danger and along with me go sirrah find him out come valentine gone my good lord a little time my lord will kill that grief longer than i prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace i do my lord she did my lord when valentine was here the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood cowardice and poor descent three things that women highly hold in hate ay if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend and that my lord i shall be loath to do 'tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend you have prevailed my lord if i can do it by aught that i can speak in his dispraise she shall not long continue love to him but say this weed her love from valentine it follows not that she will love sir thurio as much as i can do i will effect  but you sir thurio are not sharp enough you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets whose composèd rhymes should be full fraught with serviceable vows say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart write till your ink be dry and with your tears moist it again and frame some feeling line that may discover such integrity for orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews whose golden touch could soften steel and stones make tigers tame and huge leviathans forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands after your dire lamenting elegies visit by night your lady's chamber window with some sweet consort to their instruments tune a deploring dump the night's dead silence will well become such sweet complaining grievance this or else nothing will inherit her we'll wait upon your grace till after supper and afterward determine our proceedings already have i been false to valentine and now i must be as unjust to thurio under the color of commending him i have access my own love to prefer but sylvia is too fair too true too holy to be corrupted with my worthless gifts when i protest true loyalty to her she twits me with my falsehood to my friend when to her beauty i commend my vows she bids me think how i have been forsworn in breaking faith with julia whom i loved and notwithstanding all her sudden quips the least whereof would quell a lover's hope yet spaniel like the more she spurns my love the more it grows and fawneth on her still but here comes thurio now must we to her window and give some evening music to her ear ay gentle thurio for you know that love will creep in service where it cannot go sir but i do or else i would be hence ay sylvia for your sake who is sylvia what is she that all our swains commend her holy fair and wise is she the heaven such grace did lend her that she might admirèd be is she kind as she is fair for beauty lives with kindness love doth to her eyes repair to help him of his blindness and being helped inhabits there then to sylvia let us sing that sylvia is excelling she excels each mortal thing upon the dull earth dwelling to her let us garlands bring sir thurio fear not you i will so plead that you shall say my cunning drift excels at saint gregory's well madam good even to your ladyship one lady if you knew his pure heart's truth you would quickly learn to know him by his voice sir proteus gentle lady and your servant that i may compass yours i grant sweet love that i did love a lady but she is dead i likewise hear that valentine is dead sweet lady let me rake it from the earth madam if your heart be so obdurate vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love the picture that is hanging in your chamber to that i'll speak to that i'll sigh and weep for since the substance of your perfect self is else devoted i am but a shadow and to your shadow will i make true love as wretches have o'ernight that wait for execution in the morn sebastian is thy name i like thee well and will employ thee in some service presently i hope thou wilt how now you whoreson peasant where have you been these two days loitering and what says she to my little jewel but she received my dog what didst thou offer her this from me go get thee hence and find my dog again or ne'er return again into my sight away i say stayest thou to vex me here a slave that still an end turns me to shame sebastian i have entertainèd thee partly that i have need of such a youth that can with some discretion do my business  for 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout  but chiefly for thy face and thy behavior which if my augury deceive me not witness good bringing up fortune and truth therefore know thou for this i entertain thee go presently and take this ring with thee deliver it to madam sylvia she loved me well delivered it to me not so i think she lives why dost thou cry alas wherefore shouldst thou pity her well give her that ring and therewithal this letter that's her chamber tell my lady i claim the promise for her heavenly picture your message done hie home unto my chamber where thou shalt find me sad and solitary o sir i find her milder than she was and yet she takes exceptions at your person no that it is too little she says it is a fair one but pearls are fair and the old saying is black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes ill when you talk of war o sir she makes no doubt of that that you are well derived o ay and pities them that they are out by lease nor i neither and i will follow more for sylvia's love than hate of eglamour that goes with her madam this service i have done for you  though you respect not aught your servant doth  to hazard life and rescue you from him that would have forced your honor and your love vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look a smaller boon than this i cannot beg and less than this i am sure you cannot give unhappy were you madam ere i came but by my coming i have made you happy what dangerous action stood it next to death would i not undergo for one calm look o 'tis the curse in love and still approved when women cannot love where they're beloved in love who respects friend nay if the gentle spirit of moving words can no way change you to a milder form i'll woo you like a soldier at arms' end and love you 'gainst the nature of love force you i'll force thee yield to my desire valentine my shame and guilt confounds me forgive me valentine if hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offense i tender 't here i do as truly suffer as e'er i did commit look to the boy where is that ring boy how let me see why this is the ring i gave to julia but how cam'st thou by this ring at my depart i gave this unto julia how julia than men their minds 'tis true o heaven were man but constant he were perfect that one error fills him with faults makes him run through all th' sins inconstancy falls off ere it begins what is in sylvia's face but i may spy more fresh in julia's with a constant eye bear witness heaven i have my wish forever
