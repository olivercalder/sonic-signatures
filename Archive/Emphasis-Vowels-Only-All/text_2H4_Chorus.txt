open your ears for which of you will stop the vent of hearing when loud rumor speaks i from the orient to the drooping west making the wind my post horse still unfold the acts commenc√®d on this ball of earth upon my tongues continual slanders ride the which in every language i pronounce stuffing the ears of men with false reports i speak of peace while covert enmity under the smile of safety wounds the world and who but rumor who but only i make fearful musters and prepared defense whiles the big year swoll'n with some other grief is thought with child by the stern tyrant war and no such matter rumor is a pipe blown by surmises jealousies conjectures and of so easy and so plain a stop that the blunt monster with uncounted heads the still discordant wav'ring multitude can play upon it but what need i thus my well known body to anatomize among my household why is rumor here i run before king harry's victory who in a bloody field by shrewsbury hath beaten down young hotspur and his troops quenching the flame of bold rebellion even with the rebels' blood but what mean i to speak so true at first my office is to noise abroad that harry monmouth fell under the wrath of noble hotspur's sword and that the king before the douglas' rage stooped his anointed head as low as death this have i rumored through the peasant towns between that royal field of shrewsbury and this worm eaten hold of ragged stone where hotspur's father old northumberland lies crafty sick the posts come tiring on and not a man of them brings other news than they have learnt of me from rumor's tongues they bring smooth comforts false worse than true wrongs
