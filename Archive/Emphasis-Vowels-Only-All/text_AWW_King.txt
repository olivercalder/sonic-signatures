of your good father in his youth he had the wit which i can well observe today in our young lords but they may jest till their own scorn return to them unnoted ere they can hide their levity in honor so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness were in his pride or sharpness if they were his equal had awaked them and his honor clock to itself knew the true minute when exception bid him speak and at this time his tongue obeyed his hand who were below him he used as creatures of another place and bowed his eminent top to their low ranks making them proud of his humility in their poor praise he humbled such a man might be a copy to these younger times which followed well would demonstrate them now but goers backward would i were with him he would always say  methinks i hear him now his plausive words he scattered not in ears but grafted them to grow there and to bear let me not live  this his good melancholy oft began on the catastrophe and heel of pastime when it was out let me not

blessed  give me some help here ho if thou proceed as high as word my deed shall match thy deed go call before me all the lords in court sit my preserver by thy patient's side and with this healthful hand whose banished sense thou hast repealed a second time receive the confirmation of my promised gift which but attends thy naming fair maid send forth thine eye this youthful parcel of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing o'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice i have to use thy frank election make thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake peruse them well not one of those but had a noble father make choice and see who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me why then young bertram take her she's thy wife know'st thou not bertram what she has done for me thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed 'tis only title thou disdain'st in her the which i can build up strange is it that our bloods of color weight and heat poured all together would quite confound distinction yet stands off in differences so mighty if she be all that is virtuous save what thou dislik'st  a poor physician's daughter thou dislik'st of virtue for the name but do not so from lowest place whence virtuous things proceed the place is dignified by th' doer's deed where great additions swell 's and virtue none it is a dropsied honor good alone is good without a name vileness is so the property by what it is should go not by the title she is young wise fair in these to nature she's immediate heir and these breed honor that is honor's scorn which challenges itself as honor's born and is not like the sire honors thrive when rather from our acts we them derive than our foregoers the mere word's a slave debauched on every tomb on every grave a lying trophy and as oft is dumb where dust and damned oblivion is the tomb of honored bones indeed what should be said if thou canst like this creature as a maid i can create the rest virtue and she is her own dower honor and wealth from me thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose my honor's at the stake which to defeat i must produce my power here take her hand proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift that dost in vile misprision shackle up my love and her desert that canst not dream we poising us in her defective scale shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know it is in us to plant thine honor where we please to have it grow check thy contempt obey our will which travails in thy good believe not thy disdain but presently do thine own fortunes that obedient right which both thy duty owes and our power claims or i will throw thee from my care forever into the staggers and the careless lapse of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate loosing upon thee in the name of justice without all terms of pity speak thine answer take her by the hand and tell her she is thine to whom i promise a counterpoise if not to thy estate a balance more replete good fortune and the favor of the king smile upon this contract whose ceremony shall seem expedient on the now born brief and be performed tonight the solemn feast shall more attend upon the coming space expecting absent friends as thou lov'st her thy love's to me religious else does err we lost a jewel of her and our esteem was made much poorer by it but your son as mad in folly lacked the sense to know her estimation home my honored lady i have forgiven and forgotten all though my revenges were high bent upon him and watched the time to shoot praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear well call him hither we are reconciled and the first view shall kill all repetition let him not ask our pardon the nature of his great offense is dead and deeper than oblivion we do bury th' incensing relics of it let him approach a stranger no offender and inform him so 'tis our will he should what says he to your daughter have you spoke then shall we have a match i have letters sent me that sets him high in fame i am not a day of season for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail in me at once but to the brightest beams distracted clouds give way so stand thou forth the time is fair again all is whole not one word more of the consumèd time let's take the instant by the forward top for we are old and on our quick'st decrees th' inaudible and noiseless foot of time steals ere we can effect them you remember the daughter of this lord well excused that thou didst love her strikes some scores away from the great compt but love that comes too late like a remorseful pardon slowly carried to the great sender turns a sour offense crying that's good that's gone our rash faults make trivial price of serious things we have not knowing them until we know their grave oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust destroy our friends and after weep their dust our own love waking cries to see what's done while shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon be this sweet helen's knell and now forget her send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin the main consents are had and here we'll stay to see our widower's second marriage day now pray you let me see it for mine eye while i was speaking oft was fastened to 't this ring was mine and when i gave it helen i bade her if her fortunes ever stood necessitied to help that by this token i would relieve her had you that craft to reave her of what should stead her most plutus himself that knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine hath not in nature's mystery more science than i have in this ring 'twas mine 'twas helen's whoever gave it you then if you know that you are well acquainted with yourself confess 'twas hers and by what rough enforcement you got it from her she called the saints to surety that she would never put it from her finger unless she gave it to yourself in bed where you have never come or sent it us upon her great disaster thou speak'st it falsely as i love mine honor and mak'st conjectural fears to come into me which i would fain shut out if it should prove that thou art so inhuman 'twill not prove so and yet i know not thou didst hate her deadly and she is dead which nothing but to close her eyes myself could win me to believe more than to see this ring take him away my forepast proofs howe'er the matter fall shall tax my fears of little vanity having vainly feared too little away with him we'll sift this matter further i am wrapped in dismal thinkings upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead i blush to say it he won me now is the count rossillion a widower his vows are forfeited to me and my honor's paid to him he stole from florence taking no leave and i follow him to his country for justice grant it me o king in you it best lies otherwise a seducer flourishes and a poor maid is undone diana capilet the heavens have thought well on thee lafew to bring forth this discov'ry seek these suitors go speedily and bring again the count i am afeard the life of helen lady was foully snatched i wonder sir since wives are monsters to you and that you fly them as you swear them lordship yet you desire to marry what woman's that come hither count do you know these women sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend till your deeds gain them fairer prove your honor than in my thought it lies what sayst thou to her methought you said you saw one here in court could witness it

boggle shrewdly every feather starts you  is this the man you speak of tell me sirrah but tell me true i charge you not fearing the displeasure of your master which on your just proceeding i'll keep

away i do not like her now to prison with her and away with him  unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring thou diest within this hour take her away i think thee now some common customer
