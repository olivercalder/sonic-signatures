with due observance of thy godlike seat great agamemnon nestor shall apply thy latest words in the reproof of chance lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth how many shallow bauble boats dare sail upon her patient breast making their way with those of nobler bulk but let the ruffian boreas once enrage the gentle thetis and anon behold the strong ribbed bark through liquid mountains cut bounding between the two moist elements like perseus' horse where's then the saucy boat whose weak untimbered sides but even now corrivaled greatness either to harbor fled or made a toast for neptune even so doth valor's show and valor's worth divide in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness the herd hath more annoyance by the breese than by the tiger but when the splitting wind makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks and flies flee under shade why then the thing of courage as roused with rage with rage doth sympathize and with an accent tuned in selfsame key retorts to chiding fortune most wisely hath ulysses here discovered the fever whereof all our power is sick and in the imitation of these twain who as ulysses says opinion crowns with an imperial voice many are infect ajax is grown self willed and bears his head in such a rein in full as proud a place as broad achilles keeps his tent like him makes factious feasts rails on our state of war bold as an oracle and sets thersites  a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint  to match us in comparisons with dirt to weaken and discredit our exposure how rank soever rounded in with danger let this be granted and achilles' horse makes many thetis' sons tell him of nestor one that was a man when hector's grandsire sucked he is old now but if there be not in our grecian host a noble man that hath one spark of fire to answer for his love tell him from me i'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver and in my vambrace put my withered brawns and meeting him will tell him that my lady was fairer than his grandam and as chaste as may be in the world his youth in flood i'll prove this troth with my three drops of blood what says ulysses what is 't well and how true the purpose is perspicuous as substance whose grossness little characters sum up and in the publication make no strain but that achilles were his brain as barren as banks of libya though apollo knows 'tis dry enough will with great speed of judgment ay with celerity find hector's purpose pointing on him why 'tis most meet who may you else oppose that can from hector bring his honor off if not achilles though 't be a sportful combat yet in the trial much opinion dwells for here the trojans taste our dear'st repute with their fin'st palate and trust to me ulysses our imputation shall be oddly poised in this vile action for the success although particular shall give a scantling of good or bad unto the general and in such indexes although small pricks to their subsequent volumes there is seen the baby figure of the giant mass of things to come at large it is supposed he that meets hector issues from our choice and choice being mutual act of all our souls makes merit her election and doth boil as 'twere from forth us all a man distilled out of our virtues who miscarrying what heart receives from hence a conquering part to steel a strong opinion to themselves  which entertained limbs are his instruments in no less working than are swords and bows directive by the limbs i see them not with my old eyes what are they now ulysses i begin to relish thy advice and i will give a taste thereof forthwith to agamemnon go we to him straight two curs shall tame each other pride alone must tar the mastiffs on as 'twere a bone what moves ajax thus to bay at him who thersites then will ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument all the better their fraction is more our wish than their faction but it was a strong composure a fool could disunite no achilles with him and yet he loves himself is 't not strange o this is well he rubs the vein of him how he describes himself an 'twould you'd carry half he's not yet through warm force him with praises pour in pour in his ambition is dry our noble general do not do so wherefore should you so he is not emulous as achilles is what a vice were it in ajax now  ay my good son would you my lord aught with the general nothing my lord our general doth salute you with a kiss and very courtly counsel i'll begin so much for nestor a woman of quick sense the trojan's trumpet now ajax hold thine own i have thou gallant trojan seen thee oft laboring for destiny make cruel way through ranks of greekish youth and i have seen thee as hot as perseus spur thy phrygian steed despising many forfeits and subduments when thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' th' air not letting it decline on the declined that i have said to some my standers by lo jupiter is yonder dealing life and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath when that a ring of greeks have hemmed thee in like an olympian wrestling this have i seen but this thy countenance still locked in steel i never saw till now i knew thy grandsire and once fought with him he was a soldier good but by great mars the captain of us all never like thee o let an old man embrace thee and worthy warrior welcome to our tents i would my arms could match thee in contention as they contend with thee in courtesy ha by this white beard i'd fight with thee tomorrow well welcome welcome i have seen the time go bear patroclus' body to achilles and bid the snail paced ajax arm for shame there is a thousand hectors in the field now here he fights on galathe his horse and here lacks work anon he's there afoot and there they fly or die like scal√®d schools before the belching whale then is he yonder and there the strawy greeks ripe for his edge fall down before him like a mower's swath here there and everywhere he leaves and takes dexterity so obeying appetite that what he will he does and does so much that proof is called impossibility so so we draw together peace drums
