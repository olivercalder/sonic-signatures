contented the more my wrong the more his spite appears what did he marry me to famish me beggars that come unto my father's door upon entreaty have a present alms if not elsewhere they meet with charity but i who never knew how to entreat nor never needed that i should entreat am starved for meat giddy for lack of sleep with oaths kept waking and with brawling fed and that which spites me more than all these wants he does it under name of perfect love as who should say if i should sleep or eat 'twere deadly sickness or else present death i prithee go and get me some repast i care not what so it be wholesome food 'tis passing good i prithee let me have it i like it well good grumio fetch it me a dish that i do love to feed upon why then the beef and let the mustard rest then both

and speak i will i am no child no babe your betters have endured me say my mind and if you cannot best you stop your ears my tongue will tell the anger of my heart or else my heart concealing it will break and rather than it shall i will be free even to the uttermost as i please in words love me or love me not i like the cap and it i will have or i will have none i never saw a better fashioned gown more quaint more pleasing nor more commendable belike you mean to make a puppet of me i dare assure you sir 'tis almost two and 'twill be supper time ere you come there the moon the sun it is not moonlight now i know it is the sun that shines so bright forward i pray since we have come so far and be it moon or sun or what you please and if you please to call it a rush candle henceforth i vow it shall be so for me i know it is the moon then god be blest it is the bless√®d sun but sun it is not when you say it is not and the moon changes even as your mind what you will have it named even that it is and so it shall be so for katherine young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet whither away or where is thy abode happy the parents of so fair a child happier the man whom favorable stars allots thee for his lovely bedfellow pardon old father my mistaking eyes that have been so bedazzled with the sun that everything i look on seemeth green now i perceive thou art a reverend father pardon i pray thee for my mad mistaking husband let's follow to see the end of this ado what in the midst of the street no sir god forbid but ashamed to kiss nay i will give thee a kiss now pray thee love stay mistress how mean you that he that is giddy thinks the world turns round  i pray you tell me what you meant by that a very mean meaning and i am mean indeed respecting you what is your will sir that you send for me they sit conferring by the parlor fire fie fie unknit that threat'ning unkind brow and dart not scornful glances from those eyes to wound thy lord thy king thy governor it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds and in no sense is meet or amiable a woman moved is like a fountain troubled muddy ill seeming thick bereft of beauty and while it is so none so dry or thirsty will deign to sip or touch one drop of it thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee and for thy maintenance commits his body to painful labor both by sea and land to watch the night in storms the day in cold whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe and craves no other tribute at thy hands but love fair looks and true obedience  too little payment for so great a debt such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman oweth to her husband and when she is froward peevish sullen sour and not obedient to his honest will what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord i am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace or seek for rule supremacy and sway when they are bound to serve love and obey why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth unapt to toil and trouble in the world but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts come come you froward and unable worms my mind hath been as big as one of yours my heart as great my reason haply more to bandy word for word and frown for frown but now i see our lances are but straws our strength as weak our weakness past compare that seeming to be most which we indeed least are then vail your stomachs for it is no boot and place your hands below your husband's foot in token of which duty if he please my hand is ready may it do him ease
