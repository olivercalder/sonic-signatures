if the duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the king of hungary why then all the dukes fall upon the king thou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the ten commandments but scraped one out of the table ay that he razed i believe thee for i think thou never wast where grace was said in any proportion or in any language ay why not grace is grace despite of all controversy as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all grace i grant as there may between the lists and the velvet thou art the list i think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech i will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst i live forget to drink after thee behold behold where madam mitigation comes i have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to  judge a french crown more nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of thee but after all this fooling i would not have it so art thou sure of this believe me this may be he promised to meet me two hours since and he was ever precise in promise keeping away let's go learn the truth of it why how now claudio whence comes this restraint if i could speak so wisely under an arrest i would send for certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth i had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the mortality of imprisonment what's thy offense claudio what is 't murder lechery a hundred if they'll do you any good is lechery so looked after with child perhaps i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off send after the duke and appeal to him i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who i would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick tack i'll to her within two hours ho peace be in this place hail virgin if you be as those cheek roses proclaim you are no less can you so stead me as bring me to the sight of isabella a novice of this place and the fair sister to her unhappy brother claudio gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you not to be weary with you he's in prison for that which if myself might be his judge he should receive his punishment in thanks he hath got his friend with child 'tis true i would not though 'tis my familiar sin with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest tongue far from heart play with all virgins so i hold you as a thing enskied and sainted by your renouncement an immortal spirit and to be talked with in sincerity as with a saint do not believe it fewness and truth 'tis thus your brother and his lover have embraced as those that feed grow full as blossoming time that from the seedness the bare fallow brings to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb expresseth his full tilth and husbandry is she your cousin she it is this is the point the duke is very strangely gone from hence bore many gentlemen myself being one in hand and hope of action but we do learn by those that know the very nerves of state his givings out were of an infinite distance from his true meant design upon his place and with full line of his authority governs lord angelo a man whose blood is very snow broth one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge with profits of the mind study and fast he to give fear to use and liberty which have for long run by the hideous law as mice by lions hath picked out an act under whose heavy sense your brother's life falls into forfeit he arrests him on it and follows close the rigor of the statute to make him an example all hope is gone unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo and that's my pith of business 'twixt you and your poor brother has censured him already and as i hear the provost hath a warrant for 's execution assay the power you have our doubts are traitors and makes us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt go to lord angelo and let him learn to know when maidens sue men give like gods but when they weep and kneel all their petitions are as freely theirs as they themselves would owe them but speedily i take my leave of you give 't not o'er so to him again entreat him kneel down before him hang upon his gown you are too cold if you should need a pin you could not with more tame a tongue desire it to him i say you are too cold ay touch him there's the vein ay well said that's well said o to him to

steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to lord angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to 't a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him something too crabbed that way friar yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down they say this angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation is it true think you some report a sea maid spawned him some that he was begot between two stockfishes but it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice that i know to be true and he is a motion generative that's infallible why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man would the duke that is absent have done this ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service and that instructed him to mercy o sir you are deceived who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clack dish the duke had crotchets in him he would be drunk too that let me inform you sir i was an inward of his a shy fellow was the duke and i believe i know the cause of his withdrawing no pardon 'tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips but this i can let you understand the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow sir i know him and i love him come sir i know what i know sir my name is lucio well known to the duke i fear you not i'll be hanged first thou art deceived in me friar but no more of this canst thou tell if claudio die tomorrow or no why for filling a bottle with a tundish i would the duke we talk of were returned again this ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in his house eaves because they are lecherous the duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light would he were returned marry this claudio is condemned for untrussing farewell good friar i prithee pray for me the duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on fridays he's now past it yet and i say to thee  he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic say that i said so farewell good even friar where's the provost o pretty isabella i am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red thou must be patient i am fain to dine and sup with water and bran i dare not for my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set me to 't but they say the duke will be here tomorrow by my troth isabel i loved thy brother if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home he had lived friar thou knowest not the duke so well as i do he's a better woodman than thou tak'st him for nay tarry i'll go along with thee i can tell thee pretty tales of the duke i was once before him for getting a wench with child yes marry did i but i was fain to forswear it they would else have married me to the rotten medlar by my troth i'll go with thee to the lane's end if
