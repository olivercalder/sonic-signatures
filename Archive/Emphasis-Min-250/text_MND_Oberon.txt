ill met by moonlight proud titania tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord how canst thou thus for shame titania glance at my credit with hippolyta knowing i know thy love to theseus didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night from perigouna whom he ravishèd and make him with fair aegles break his faith with ariadne and antiopa do you amend it then it lies in you why should titania cross her oberon i do but beg a little changeling boy to be my henchman how long within this wood intend you stay give me that boy and i will go with thee well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury  my gentle puck come hither thou rememb'rest since once i sat upon a promontory and heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the sea maid's music that very time i saw but thou couldst not flying between the cold moon and the earth cupid all armed a certain aim he took at a fair vestal thronèd by the west and loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts but i might see young cupid's fiery shaft quenched in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon and the imperial vot'ress passèd on in maiden meditation fancy free yet marked i where the bolt of cupid fell it fell upon a little western flower before milk white now purple with love's wound and maidens call it love in idleness fetch me that flower the herb i showed thee once the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees fetch me this herb and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league having once this juice i'll watch titania when she is asleep and drop the liquor of it in her eyes the next thing then she waking looks upon be it on lion bear or wolf or bull on meddling monkey or on busy ape she shall pursue it with the soul of love and ere i take this charm from off her sight as i can take it with another herb i'll make her render up her page to me but who comes here i am invisible and i will overhear their conference fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love hast thou the flower there welcome wanderer i pray thee give it me i know a bank where the wild thyme blows where oxlips and the nodding violet grows quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine with sweet muskroses and with eglantine there sleeps titania sometime of the night lulled in these flowers with dances and delight and there the snake throws her enameled skin weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in and with the juice of this i'll streak her eyes and make her full of hateful fantasies take thou some of it and seek through this grove a sweet athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth anoint his eyes but do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady thou shalt know the man by the athenian garments he hath on effect it with some care that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow what thou seest when thou dost wake do it for thy true love take love and languish for his sake be it ounce or cat or bear pard or boar with bristled hair in thy eye that shall appear when thou wak'st it is thy dear wake when some vile thing is near i wonder if titania be awaked then what it was that next came in her eye which she must dote on in extremity here comes my messenger how now mad spirit what night rule now about this haunted grove this falls out better than i could devise but hast thou yet latched the athenian's eyes with the love juice as i did bid thee do stand close this is the same athenian what hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite and laid the love juice on some true love's sight of thy misprision must perforce ensue some true love turned and not a false turned true about the wood go swifter than the wind and helena of athens look thou find all fancy sick she is and pale of cheer with sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear by some illusion see thou bring her here i'll charm his eyes against she do appear flower of this purple dye hit with cupid's archery sink in apple of his eye when his love he doth espy let her shine as gloriously as the venus of the sky  when thou wak'st if she be by beg of her for remedy stand aside the noise they make will cause demetrius to awake this is thy negligence still thou mistak'st or else committ'st thy knaveries willfully thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight hie therefore robin overcast the night the starry welkin cover thou anon with drooping fog as black as acheron and lead these testy rivals so astray as one come not within another's way like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong and sometime rail thou like demetrius and from each other look thou lead them thus till o'er their brows death counterfeiting sleep with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep then crush this herb into lysander's eye whose liquor hath this virtuous property to take from thence all error with his might and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight when they next wake all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision and back to athens shall the lovers wend with league whose date till death shall never end whiles i in this affair do thee employ i'll to my queen and beg her indian boy and then i will her charmèd eye release from monster's view and all things shall be peace but we are spirits of another sort i with the morning's love have oft made sport and like a forester the groves may tread even till the eastern gate all fiery red opening on neptune with fair blessèd beams turns into yellow gold his salt green streams but notwithstanding haste make no delay we may effect this business yet ere day welcome good robin seest thou this sweet sight her dotage now i do begin to pity for meeting her of late behind the wood seeking sweet favors for this hateful fool i did upbraid her and fall out with her for she his hairy temples then had rounded with coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers and that same dew which sometime on the buds was wont to swell like round and orient pearls stood now within the pretty flouriets' eyes like tears that did their own disgrace bewail when i had at my pleasure taunted her and she in mild terms begged my patience i then did ask of her her changeling child which straight she gave me and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairyland and now i have the boy i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes and gentle puck take this transformèd scalp from off the head of this athenian swain that he awaking when the other do may all to athens back again repair and think no more of this night's accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream but first i will release the fairy queen be as thou wast wont to be see as thou wast wont to see dian's bud o'er cupid's flower hath such force and blessèd power now my titania wake you my sweet queen there lies your love silence awhile robin take off this head  titania music call and strike more dead than common sleep of all these five the sense sound music come my queen take hands with me and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be now thou and i are new in amity and will tomorrow midnight solemnly dance in duke theseus' house triumphantly and bless it to all fair prosperity there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be wedded with theseus all in jollity then my queen in silence sad trip we after night's shade we the globe can compass soon swifter than the wand'ring moon through the house give glimmering light by the dead and drowsy fire every elf and fairy sprite hop as light as bird from brier and this ditty after me sing and dance it trippingly now until the break of day through this house each fairy stray to the best bride bed will we which by us shall blessèd be and the issue there create ever shall be fortunate so shall all the couples three ever true in loving be and the blots of nature's hand shall not in their issue stand never mole harelip nor scar nor mark prodigious such as are despisèd in nativity shall upon their children be with this field dew consecrate every fairy take his gait and each several chamber bless through this palace with sweet peace and the owner of it blest ever shall in safety rest trip away make no stay meet me all by break of day
