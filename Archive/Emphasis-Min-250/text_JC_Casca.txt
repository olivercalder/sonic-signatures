peace ho caesar speaks bid every noise be still peace yet again you pulled me by the cloak would you speak with me why you were with him were you not why there was a crown offered him and being offered him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell a shouting why for that too why for that too ay marry was 't and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shouted why antony i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark antony offer him a crown yet 'twas not a crown neither 'twas one of these coronets and as i told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it and then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked caesar for he swooned and fell down at it and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down if the tag rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theater i am no true man marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut an i had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogues and so he fell when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity three or four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts but there's no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less ay ay he spoke greek nay an i tell you that i'll ne'er look you i' th' face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarves off caesar's images are put to silence fare you well there was more foolery yet if i could remember it no i am promised forth ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating do so farewell both are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen th' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threat'ning clouds but never till tonight never till now did i go through a tempest dropping fire either there is a civil strife in heaven or else the world too saucy with the gods incenses them to send destruction a common slave you know him well by sight held up his left hand which did flame and burn like twenty torches joined and yet his hand not sensible of fire remained unscorched besides i ha' not since put up my sword against the capitol i met a lion who glazed upon me and went surly by without annoying me and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transform√®d with their fear who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noonday upon the marketplace hooting and shrieking when these prodigies do so conjointly meet let not men say these are their reasons they are natural for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon he doth for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there tomorrow farewell cicero a roman your ear is good cassius what night is this who ever knew the heavens menace so but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us 'tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius indeed they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy so can i so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity you speak to casca and to such a man that is no fleering telltale hold my hand be factious for redress of all these griefs and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest stand close awhile for here comes one in haste o he sits high in all the people's hearts and that which would appear offense in us his countenance like richest alchemy will change to virtue and to worthiness no you shall confess that you are both deceived here as i point my sword the sun arises which is a great way growing on the south weighing the youthful season of the year some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire and the high east stands as the capitol directly here let us not leave him out indeed he is not fit speak hands for me go to the pulpit brutus why he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death
