among the crowd i' th' abbey where a finger could not be wedged in more i am stifled with the mere rankness of their joy that i did well worth the seeing as well as i am able the rich stream of lords and ladies having brought the queen to a prepared place in the choir fell off a distance from her while her grace sat down to rest awhile some half an hour or so in a rich chair of state opposing freely the beauty of her person to the people believe me sir she is the goodliest woman that ever lay by man which when the people had the full view of such a noise arose as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest  as loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks doublets i think flew up and had their faces been loose this day they had been lost such joy i never saw before great bellied women that had not half a week to go like rams in the old time of war would shake the press and make 'em reel before 'em no man living could say this is my wife there all were woven so strangely in one piece at length her grace rose and with modest paces came to the altar where she kneeled and saintlike cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly then rose again and bowed her to the people when by the archbishop of canterbury she had all the royal makings of a queen  as holy oil edward confessor's crown the rod and bird of peace and all such emblems  laid nobly on her which performed the choir with all the choicest music of the kingdom together sung te deum so she parted and with the same full state paced back again to york place where the feast is held i know it but 'tis so lately altered that the old name is fresh about me stokeley and gardiner the one of winchester newly preferred from the king's secretary the other london all the land knows that however yet there is no great breach when it comes cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him thomas cromwell a man in much esteem with th' king and truly a worthy friend the king has made him master o' th' jewel house and one already of the privy council yes without all doubt come gentlemen you shall go my way which is to th' court and there you shall be my guests something i can command as i walk thither i'll tell you more
