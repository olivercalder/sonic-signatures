where should this music be i' th' air or th' earth it sounds no more and sure it waits upon some god o' th' island sitting on a bank weeping again the king my father's wrack this music crept by me upon the waters allaying both their fury and my passion with its sweet air thence i have followed it or it hath drawn me rather but 'tis gone no it begins again the ditty does remember my drowned father this is no mortal business nor no sound that the earth owes i hear it now above me most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend vouchsafe my prayer may know if you remain upon this island and that you will some good instruction give how i may bear me here my prime request which i do last pronounce is o you wonder  if you be maid or no my language heavens i am the best of them that speak this speech were i but where 'tis spoken a single thing as i am now that wonders to hear thee speak of naples he does hear me and that he does i weep myself am naples who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld the king my father wracked yes faith and all his lords the duke of milan and his brave son being twain o if a virgin and your affection not gone forth i'll make you the queen of naples no as i am a man no i will resist such entertainment till mine enemy has more power so they are my spirits as in a dream are all bound up my father's loss the weakness which i feel the wrack of all my friends nor this man's threats to whom i am subdued are but light to me might i but through my prison once a day behold this maid all corners else o' th' earth let liberty make use of space enough have i in such a prison there be some sports are painful and their labor delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone and most poor matters point to rich ends this my mean task would be as heavy to me as odious but the mistress which i serve quickens what's dead and makes my labors pleasures o she is ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed and he's composed of harshness i must remove some thousands of these logs and pile them up upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness had never like executor i forget but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors most busiest when i do it o most dear mistress the sun will set before i shall discharge what i must strive to do no precious creature i had rather crack my sinews break my back than you should such dishonor undergo while i sit lazy by no noble mistress 'tis fresh morning with me when you are by at night i do beseech you chiefly that i might set it in my prayers what is your name admired miranda indeed the top of admiration worth what's dearest to the world full many a lady i have eyed with best regard and many a time th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage brought my too diligent ear for several virtues have i liked several women never any with so full soul but some defect in her did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed and put it to the foil but you o you so perfect and so peerless are created of every creature's best i am in my condition a prince miranda i do think a king  i would not so and would no more endure this wooden slavery than to suffer the flesh fly blow my mouth hear my soul speak the very instant that i saw you did my heart fly to your service there resides to make me slave to it and for your sake am i this patient log man o heaven o earth bear witness to this sound and crown what i profess with kind event if i speak true if hollowly invert what best is boded me to mischief i beyond all limit of what else i' th' world do love prize honor you wherefore weep you my mistress dearest and i thus humble ever ay with a heart as willing as bondage e'er of freedom here's my hand a thousand thousand i do believe it against an oracle as i hope for quiet days fair issue and long life with such love as 'tis now the murkiest den the most opportune place the strong'st suggestion our worser genius can shall never melt mine honor into lust to take away the edge of that day's celebration when i shall think or phoebus' steeds are foundered or night kept chained below i warrant you sir the white cold virgin snow upon my heart abates the ardor of my liver this is a most majestic vision and harmonious charmingly may i be bold to think these spirits let me live here ever so rare a wondered father and a wise makes this place paradise this is strange your father's in some passion that works him strongly we wish your peace no my dearest love i would not for the world though the seas threaten they are merciful i have cursed them without cause sir she is mortal but by immortal providence she's mine i chose her when i could not ask my father for his advice nor thought i had one she is daughter to this famous duke of milan of whom so often i have heard renown but never saw before of whom i have received a second life and second father this lady makes him to me
