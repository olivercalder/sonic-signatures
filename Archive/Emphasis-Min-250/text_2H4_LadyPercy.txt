o yet for god's sake go not to these wars the time was father that you broke your word when you were more endeared to it than now when your own percy when my heart's dear harry threw many a northward look to see his father bring up his powers but he did long in vain who then persuaded you to stay at home there were two honors lost yours and your son's for yours the god of heaven brighten it for his it stuck upon him as the sun in the gray vault of heaven and by his light did all the chivalry of england move to do brave acts he was indeed the glass wherein the noble youth did dress themselves he had no legs that practiced not his gait and speaking thick which nature made his blemish became the accents of the valiant for those that could speak low and tardily would turn their own perfection to abuse to seem like him so that in speech in gait in diet in affections of delight in military rules humors of blood he was the mark and glass copy and book that fashioned others and him o wondrous him o miracle of men him did you leave second to none unseconded by you to look upon the hideous god of war in disadvantage to abide a field where nothing but the sound of hotspur's name did seem defensible so you left him never o never do his ghost the wrong to hold your honor more precise and nice with others than with him let them alone the marshal and the archbishop are strong had my sweet harry had but half their numbers today might i hanging on hotspur's neck have talked of monmouth's grave if they get ground and vantage of the king then join you with them like a rib of steel to make strength stronger but for all our loves first let them try themselves so did your son he was so suffered so came i a widow and never shall have length of life enough to rain upon remembrance with mine eyes that it may grow and sprout as high as heaven for recordation to my noble husband
