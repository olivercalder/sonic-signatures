long live queen margaret england's happiness for grief that they are past recovery for were there hope to conquer them again my sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears anjou and maine myself did win them both those provinces these arms of mine did conquer and are the cities that i got with wounds delivered up again with peaceful words mort dieu so god help warwick as he loves the land and common profit of his country unto the main o father maine is lost that maine which by main force warwick did win and would have kept so long as breath did last main chance father you meant but i meant maine which i will win from france or else be slain whether your grace be worthy yea or no dispute not that york is the worthier the cardinal's not my better in the field warwick may live to be the best of all that can i witness and a fouler fact did never traitor in the land commit image of pride why should i hold my peace sweet york begin and if thy claim be good the nevilles are thy subjects to command father the duke hath told the truth thus got the house of lancaster the crown what plain proceedings is more plain than this henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt the fourth son york claims it from the third till lionel's issue fails his should not reign it fails not yet but flourishes in thee and in thy sons fair slips of such a stock then father salisbury kneel we together and in this private plot be we the first that shall salute our rightful sovereign with honor of his birthright to the crown long live our sovereign richard england's king my heart assures me that the earl of warwick shall one day make the duke of york a king it is reported mighty sovereign that good duke humphrey traitorously is murdered by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort's means the commons like an angry hive of bees that want their leader scatter up and down and care not who they sting in his revenge myself have calmed their spleenful mutiny until they hear the order of his death that shall i do my liege stay salisbury with the rude multitude till i return come hither gracious sovereign view this body as surely as my soul intends to live with that dread king that took our state upon him to free us from his father's wrathful curse i do believe that violent hands were laid upon the life of this thrice famèd duke see how the blood is settled in his face oft have i seen a timely parted ghost of ashy semblance meager pale and bloodless being all descended to the laboring heart who in the conflict that it holds with death attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth to blush and beautify the cheek again but see his face is black and full of blood his eyeballs further out than when he lived staring full ghastly like a strangled man his hair upreared his nostrils stretched with struggling his hands abroad displayed as one that grasped and tugged for life and was by strength subdued look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking his well proportioned beard made rough and rugged like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged it cannot be but he was murdered here the least of all these signs were probable but both of you were vowed duke humphrey's foes and you forsooth had the good duke to keep 'tis like you would not feast him like a friend and 'tis well seen he found an enemy who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh and sees fast by a butcher with an ax but will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest but may imagine how the bird was dead although the kite soar with unbloodied beak even so suspicious is this tragedy what dares not warwick if false suffolk dare him madam be still with reverence may i say  for every word you speak in his behalf is slander to your royal dignity but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee and i should rob the deathsman of his fee quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames and that my sovereign's presence makes me mild i would false murd'rous coward on thy knee make thee beg pardon for thy passèd speech and say it was thy mother that thou meant'st that thou thyself wast born in bastardy and after all this fearful homage done give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men away even now or i will drag thee hence unworthy though thou art i'll cope with thee and do some service to duke humphrey's ghost beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee see how the pangs of death do make him grin so bad a death argues a monstrous life you were best to go to bed and dream again to keep thee from the tempest of the field now by my father's badge old neville's crest the rampant bear chained to the ragged staff this day i'll wear aloft my burgonet  as on a mountaintop the cedar shows that keeps his leaves in spite of any storm  even to affright thee with the view thereof clifford of cumberland 'tis warwick calls an if thou dost not hide thee from the bear now when the angry trumpet sounds alarum and dead men's cries do fill the empty air clifford i say come forth and fight with me proud northern lord clifford of cumberland warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms how now my noble lord what all afoot of one or both of us the time is come then nobly york 'tis for a crown thou fight'st  as i intend clifford to thrive today it grieves my soul to leave thee unassailed after them nay before them if we can now by my hand lords 'twas a glorious day saint albans battle won by famous york shall be eternized in all age to come  sound drum and trumpets and to london all and more such days as these to us befall
