i am much bounden to your majesty so well that what you bid me undertake though that my death were adjunct to my act by heaven i would do it and i'll keep him so that he shall not offend your majesty my lord he shall not live heat me these irons hot and look thou stand within the arras when i strike my foot upon the bosom of the ground rush forth and bind the boy which you shall find with me fast to the chair be heedful hence and watch uncleanly scruples fear not you look to 't young lad come forth i have to say with you good morrow little prince indeed i have been merrier if i talk to him with his innocent prate he will awake my mercy which lies dead therefore i will be sudden and dispatch his words do take possession of my bosom read here young arthur how now foolish rheum turning dispiteous torture out of door i must be brief lest resolution drop out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears  can you not read it is it not fair writ young boy i must and i will i have sworn to do it and with hot irons must i burn them out come forth do as i bid you do give me the iron i say and bind him here go stand within let me alone with him come boy prepare yourself none but to lose your eyes is this your promise go to hold your tongue i can heat it boy but with my breath i can revive it boy well see to live i will not touch thine eye for all the treasure that thine uncle owes yet am i sworn and i did purpose boy with this same very iron to burn them out peace no more adieu your uncle must not know but you are dead i'll fill these doggèd spies with false reports and pretty child sleep doubtless and secure that hubert for the wealth of all the world will not offend thee silence no more go closely in with me much danger do i undergo for thee my lord they say five moons were seen tonight  four fixèd and the fifth did whirl about the other four in wondrous motion old men and beldams in the streets do prophesy upon it dangerously young arthur's death is common in their mouths and when they talk of him they shake their heads and whisper one another in the ear and he that speaks doth grip the hearer's wrist whilst he that hears makes fearful action with wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool with open mouth swallowing a tailor's news who with his shears and measure in his hand standing on slippers which his nimble haste had falsely thrust upon contrary feet told of a many thousand warlike french that were embattlèd and ranked in kent another lean unwashed artificer cuts off his tale and talks of arthur's death no had my lord why did you not provoke me here is your hand and seal for what i did my lord  arm you against your other enemies i'll make a peace between your soul and you young arthur is alive this hand of mine is yet a maiden and an innocent hand not painted with the crimson spots of blood within this bosom never entered yet the dreadful motion of a murderous thought and you have slandered nature in my form which howsoever rude exteriorly is yet the cover of a fairer mind than to be butcher of an innocent child lords i am hot with haste in seeking you arthur doth live the king hath sent for you i am no villain stand back lord salisbury stand back i say by heaven i think my sword's as sharp as yours i would not have you lord forget yourself nor tempt the danger of my true defense lest i by marking of your rage forget your worth your greatness and nobility not for my life but yet i dare defend my innocent life against an emperor do not prove me so yet i am none whose tongue soe'er speaks false not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies lord bigot i am none 'tis not an hour since i left him well i honored him i loved him and will weep my date of life out for his sweet life's loss do but hear me sir upon my soul  if i in act consent or sin of thought be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath which was embounded in this beauteous clay let hell want pains enough to torture me i left him well badly i fear how fares your majesty who's there speak ho speak quickly or i shoot of the part of england what's that to thee thou hast a perfect thought i will upon all hazards well believe thou art my friend that know'st my tongue so well who art thou unkind remembrance thou and endless night have done me shame brave soldier pardon me that any accent breaking from thy tongue should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear why here walk i in the black brow of night to find you out o my sweet sir news fitting to the night black fearful comfortless and horrible the king i fear is poisoned by a monk i left him almost speechless and broke out to acquaint you with this evil that you might the better arm you to the sudden time than if you had at leisure known of this a monk i tell you a resolvèd villain whose bowels suddenly burst out the king yet speaks and peradventure may recover why know you not the lords are all come back and brought prince henry in their company at whose request the king hath pardoned them and they are all about his majesty
