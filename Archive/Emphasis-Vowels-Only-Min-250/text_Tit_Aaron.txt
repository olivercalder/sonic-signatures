now climbeth tamora olympus' top safe out of fortune's shot and sits aloft secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash advanced above pale envy's threat'ning reach as when the golden sun salutes the morn and having gilt the ocean with his beams gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach and overlooks the highest peering hills so tamora upon her wit doth earthly honor wait and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown then aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress and mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long hast prisoner held fettered in amorous chains and faster bound to aaron's charming eyes than is prometheus tied to caucasus away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts i will be bright and shine in pearl and gold to wait upon this new made emperess to wait said i to wanton with this queen this goddess this semiramis this nymph this siren that will charm rome's saturnine and see his shipwrack and his commonweal's holla what storm is this clubs clubs these lovers will not keep the peace why how now lords so near the emperor's palace dare you draw and maintain such a quarrel openly full well i wot the ground of all this grudge i would not for a million of gold the cause were known to them it most concerns nor would your noble mother for much more be so dishonored in the court of rome for shame put up away i say now by the gods that warlike goths adore this petty brabble will undo us all why lords and think you not how dangerous it is to jet upon a prince's right what is lavinia then become so loose or bassianus so degenerate that for her love such quarrels may be broached without controlment justice or revenge young lords beware and should the empress know this discord's ground the music would not please why are you mad or know you not in rome how furious and impatient they be and cannot brook competitors in love i tell you lords you do but plot your deaths by this device to achieve her how ay and as good as saturninus may why then it seems some certain snatch or so would serve your turns would you had hit it too then should not we be tired with this ado why hark you hark you and are you such fools to square for this would it offend you then that both should speed for shame be friends and join for that you jar 'tis policy and stratagem must do that you affect and so must you resolve that what you cannot as you would achieve you must perforce accomplish as you may take this of me lucrece was not more chaste than this lavinia bassianus' love a speedier course than ling'ring languishment must we pursue and i have found the path my lords a solemn hunting is in hand there will the lovely roman ladies troop the forest walks are wide and spacious and many unfrequented plots there are fitted by kind for rape and villainy single you thither then this dainty doe and strike her home by force if not by words this way or not at all stand you in hope come come our empress with her sacred wit to villainy and vengeance consecrate will we acquaint withal what we intend and she shall file our engines with advice that will not suffer you to square yourselves but to your wishes' height advance you both the emperor's court is like the house of fame the palace full of tongues of eyes and ears the woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull there speak and strike brave boys and take your turns there serve your lust shadowed from heaven's eye and revel in lavinia's treasury he that had wit would think that i had none to bury so much gold under a tree and never after to inherit it let him that thinks of me so abjectly know that this gold must coin a stratagem which cunningly effected will beget a very excellent piece of villainy and so repose sweet gold for their unrest that have their alms out of the empress' chest madam though venus govern your desires saturn is dominator over mine what signifies my deadly standing eye my silence and my cloudy melancholy my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls even as an adder when she doth unroll to do some fatal execution no madam these are no venereal signs vengeance is in my heart death in my hand blood and revenge are hammering in my head hark tamora the empress of my soul which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee this is the day of doom for bassianus his philomel must lose her tongue today thy sons make pillage of her chastity and wash their hands in bassianus' blood seest thou this letter take it up i pray thee and give the king this fatal plotted scroll now question me no more we are espied here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty which dreads not yet their lives' destruction no more great empress bassianus comes be cross with him and i'll go fetch thy sons to back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they be come on my lords the better foot before straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit where i espied the panther fast asleep now will i fetch the king to find them here that he thereby may have a likely guess how these were they that made away his brother my gracious lord here is the bag of gold titus andronicus my lord the emperor sends thee this word that if thou love thy sons let marcus lucius or thyself old titus or any one of you chop off your hand and send it to the king he for the same will send thee hither both thy sons alive and that shall be the ransom for their fault nay come agree whose hand shall go along for fear they die before their pardon come if that be called deceit i will be honest and never whilst i live deceive men so but i'll deceive you in another sort and that you'll say ere half an hour pass i go andronicus and for thy hand look by and by to have thy sons with thee their heads i mean o how this villainy doth fat me with the very thoughts of it let fools do good and fair men call for grace aaron will have his soul black like his face ay some mad message from his mad grandfather ay just a verse in horace right you have it now what a thing it is to be an ass here's no sound jest the old man hath found their guilt and sends them weapons wrapped about with lines that wound beyond their feeling to the quick but were our witty empress well afoot she would applaud andronicus' conceit but let her rest in her unrest awhile  and now young lords was 't not a happy star led us to rome strangers and more than so captives to be advancèd to this height it did me good

sanguine shallow hearted boys you white limed walls you alehouse painted signs coal black is better than another hue in that it scorns to bear another hue for all the water in the ocean can never turn the swan's black legs to white although she lave them hourly in the flood tell the empress from me i am of age to keep mine own excuse it how she can my mistress is my mistress this myself the vigor and the picture of my youth this before all the world do i prefer this maugre all the world will i keep safe or some of you shall smoke for it in rome why there's the privilege your beauty bears fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing the close enacts and counsels of thy heart here's a young lad framed of another leer look how the black slave smiles upon the father as who should say old lad i am thine own he is your brother lords sensibly fed of that self blood that first gave life to you and from that womb where you imprisoned were he is enfranchisèd and come to light nay he is your brother by the surer side although my seal be stampèd in his face then sit we down and let us all consult my son and i will have the wind of you keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety why so brave lords when we join in league i am a lamb but if you brave the moor the chafèd boar the mountain lioness the ocean swells not so as aaron storms but say again how many saw the child the empress the midwife and yourself two may keep counsel when the third's away go to the empress tell her this i said wheak wheak so cries a pig preparèd to the spit o lord sir 'tis a deed of policy shall she live to betray this guilt of ours a long tongued babbling gossip no lords no and now be it known to you my full intent not far one muliteus my countryman his wife but yesternight was brought to bed his child is like to her fair as you are go pack with him and give the mother gold and tell them both the circumstance of all and how by this their child shall be advanced and be receivèd for the emperor's heir and substituted in the place of mine to calm this tempest whirling in the court and let the emperor dandle him for his own hark you lords you see i have given her physic and you must needs bestow her funeral the fields are near and you are gallant grooms this done see that you take no longer days but send the midwife presently to me the midwife and the nurse well made away then let the ladies tattle what they please now to the goths as swift as swallow flies there to dispose this treasure in mine arms and secretly to greet the empress' friends  come on you thick lipped slave i'll bear you hence for it is you that puts us to our shifts i'll make you feed on berries and on roots and feed on curds and whey and suck the goat and cabin in a cave and bring you up to be a warrior and command a camp touch not the boy he is of royal blood lucius save the child and bear it from me to the empress if thou do this i'll show thee wondrous things that highly may advantage thee to hear if thou wilt not befall what may befall i'll speak no more but vengeance rot you all and if it please thee why assure thee lucius 'twill vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak for i must talk of murders rapes and massacres acts of black night abominable deeds complots of mischief treason villainies ruthful to hear yet piteously performed and this shall all be buried in my death unless thou swear to me my child shall live swear that he shall and then i will begin what if i do not as indeed i do not yet for i know thou art religious and hast a thing within thee callèd conscience with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies which i have seen thee careful to observe therefore i urge thy oath for that i know an idiot holds his bauble for a god and keeps the oath which by that god he swears to that i'll urge him therefore thou shalt vow by that same god what god soe'er it be that thou adorest and hast in reverence to save my boy to nourish and bring him up or else i will discover naught to thee first know thou i begot him on the empress tut lucius this was but a deed of charity to that which thou shalt hear of me anon 'twas her two sons that murdered bassianus they cut thy sister's tongue and ravished her and cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest why she was washed and cut and trimmed and 'twas trim sport for them which had the doing of it indeed i was their tutor to instruct them that codding spirit had they from their mother as sure a card as ever won the set that bloody mind i think they learned of me as true a dog as ever fought at head well let my deeds be witness of my worth i trained thy brethren to that guileful hole where the dead corpse of bassianus lay i wrote the letter that thy father found and hid the gold within that letter mentioned confederate with the queen and her two sons and what not done that thou hast cause to rue wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it i played the cheater for thy father's hand and when i had it drew myself apart and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter i pried me through the crevice of a wall when for his hand he had his two sons' heads beheld his tears and laughed so heartily that both mine eyes were rainy like to his and when i told the empress of this sport she sounded almost at my pleasing tale and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses ay like a black dog as the saying is ay that i had not done a thousand more even now i curse the day and yet i think few come within the compass of my curse  wherein i did not some notorious ill as kill a man or else devise his death ravish a maid or plot the way to do it accuse some innocent and forswear myself set deadly enmity between two friends make poor men's cattle break their necks set fire on barns and haystalks in the night and bid the owners quench them with their tears oft have i digged up dead men from their graves and set them upright at their dear friends' door even when their sorrows almost was forgot and on their skins as on the bark of trees have with my knife carvèd in roman letters let not your sorrow die though i am dead but i have done a thousand dreadful things as willingly as one would kill a fly and nothing grieves me heartily indeed but that i cannot do ten thousand more if there be devils would i were a devil to live and burn in everlasting fire so i might have your company in hell but to torment you with my bitter tongue some devil whisper curses in my ear and prompt me that my tongue may utter forth the venomous malice of my swelling heart ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb i am no baby i that with base prayers i should repent the evils i have done ten thousand worse than ever yet i did would i perform if i might have my will if one good deed in all my life i did i do repent it from my very soul
