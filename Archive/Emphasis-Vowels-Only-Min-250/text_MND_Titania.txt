what jealous oberon fairies skip hence i have forsworn his bed and company then i must be thy lady but i know when thou hast stolen away from fairyland and in the shape of corin sat all day playing on pipes of corn and versing love to amorous phillida why art thou here come from the farthest steep of india but that forsooth the bouncing amazon your buskined mistress and your warrior love to theseus must be wedded and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity these are the forgeries of jealousy and never since the middle summer's spring met we on hill in dale forest or mead by pavèd fountain or by rushy brook or in the beachèd margent of the sea to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind but with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport therefore the winds piping to us in vain as in revenge have sucked up from the sea contagious fogs which falling in the land hath every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents the ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain the plowman lost his sweat and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard the fold stands empty in the drownèd field and crows are fatted with the murrain flock the nine men's morris is filled up with mud and the quaint mazes in the wanton green for lack of tread are undistinguishable the human mortals want their winter here no night is now with hymn or carol blessed therefore the moon the governess of floods pale in her anger washes all the air that rheumatic diseases do abound and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter hoary headed frosts fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose and on old hiems' thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is as in mockery set the spring the summer the childing autumn angry winter change their wonted liveries and the mazèd world by their increase now knows not which is which and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate from our dissension we are their parents and original set your heart at rest the fairyland buys not the child of me his mother was a vot'ress of my order and in the spicèd indian air by night full often hath she gossiped by my side and sat with me on neptune's yellow sands marking th' embarkèd traders on the flood when we have laughed to see the sails conceive and grow big bellied with the wanton wind which she with pretty and with swimming gait following her womb then rich with my young squire would imitate and sail upon the land to fetch me trifles and return again as from a voyage rich with merchandise but she being mortal of that boy did die and for her sake do i rear up her boy and for her sake i will not part with him perchance till after theseus' wedding day if you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels go with us if not shun me and i will spare your haunts not for thy fairy kingdom fairies away we shall chide downright if i longer stay come now a roundel and a fairy song then for the third part of a minute hence  some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds some war with reremice for their leathern wings to make my small elves coats and some keep back the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders at our quaint spirits sing me now asleep then to your offices and let me rest what angel wakes me from my flow'ry bed i pray thee gentle mortal sing again mine ear is much enamored of thy note so is mine eye enthrallèd to thy shape and thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me on the first view to say to swear i love thee thou art as wise as thou art beautiful out of this wood do not desire to go thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no i am a spirit of no common rate the summer still doth tend upon my state and i do love thee therefore go with me i'll give thee fairies to attend on thee and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep and sing while thou on pressèd flowers dost sleep and i will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go  peaseblossom cobweb mote and mustardseed be kind and courteous to this gentleman hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes feed him with apricocks and dewberries with purple grapes green figs and mulberries the honey bags steal from the humble bees and for night tapers crop their waxen thighs and light them at the fiery glowworms' eyes to have my love to bed and to arise and pluck the wings from painted butterflies to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes nod to him elves and do him courtesies come wait upon him lead him to my bower the moon methinks looks with a wat'ry eye and when she weeps weeps every little flower lamenting some enforcèd chastity tie up my lover's tongue bring him silently come sit thee down upon this flow'ry bed while i thy amiable cheeks do coy and stick muskroses in thy sleek smooth head and kiss thy fair large ears my gentle joy what wilt thou hear some music my sweet love or say sweet love what thou desirest to eat i have a venturous fairy that shall seek the squirrel's hoard and fetch thee new nuts sleep thou and i will wind thee in my arms  fairies begone and be all ways away so doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently entwist the female ivy so enrings the barky fingers of the elm o how i love thee how i dote on thee my oberon what visions have i seen methought i was enamored of an ass how came these things to pass o how mine eyes do loathe his visage now music ho music such as charmeth sleep come my lord and in our flight tell me how it came this night that i sleeping here was found with these mortals on the ground first rehearse your song by rote to each word a warbling note hand in hand with fairy grace will we sing and bless this place
