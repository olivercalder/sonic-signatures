your advice is cried up with example what strange ruins since first we went to school may we perceive walking in thebes scars and bare weeds the gain o' th' martialist who did propound to his bold ends honor and golden ingots which though he won he had not and now flirted by peace for whom he fought who then shall offer to mars's so scorned altar i do bleed when such i meet and wish great juno would resume her ancient fit of jealousy to get the soldier work that peace might purge for her repletion and retain anew her charitable heart now hard and harsher than strife or war could be yes i pity decays where'er i find them but such most that sweating in an honorable toil are paid with ice to cool 'em 'tis in our power  unless we fear that apes can tutor 's to be masters of our manners what need i affect another's gait which is not catching where there is faith or to be fond upon another's way of speech when by mine own i may be reasonably conceived saved too speaking it truly why am i bound by any generous bond to follow him follows his tailor haply so long until the followed make pursuit or let me know why mine own barber is unblessed with him my poor chin too for 'tis not scissored just to such a favorite's glass what canon is there that does command my rapier from my hip to dangle 't in my hand or to go tiptoe before the street be foul either i am the forehorse in the team or i am none that draw i' th' sequent trace these poor slight sores need not a plantain that which rips my bosom almost to th' heart's  he a most unbounded tyrant whose successes makes heaven unfeared and villainy assured beyond its power there's nothing almost puts faith in a fever and deifies alone voluble chance who only attributes the faculties of other instruments to his own nerves and act commands men service and what they win in 't boot and glory one that fears not to do harm good dares not let the blood of mine that's sib to him be sucked from me with leeches let them break and fall off me with that corruption nothing truer i think the echoes of his shames have deafed the ears of heav'nly justice widows' cries descend again into their throats and have not due audience of the gods valerius small winds shake him but what's the matter leave that unreasoned our services stand now for thebes not creon yet to be neutral to him were dishonor rebellious to oppose therefore we must with him stand to the mercy of our fate who hath bounded our last minute let's to the king who were he a quarter carrier of that honor which his enemy come in the blood we venture should be as for our health which were not spent rather laid out for purchase but alas our hands advanced before our hearts what will the fall o' th' stroke do damage how do you noble cousin why strong enough to laugh at misery and bear the chance of war yet we are prisoners i fear forever cousin o cousin arcite where is thebes now where is our noble country where are our friends and kindreds never more must we behold those comforts never see the hardy youths strive for the games of honor hung with the painted favors of their ladies like tall ships under sail then start amongst 'em and as an east wind leave 'em all behind us like lazy clouds whilst palamon and arcite even in the wagging of a wanton leg outstripped the people's praises won the garlands ere they have time to wish 'em ours o never shall we two exercise like twins of honor our arms again and feel our fiery horses like proud seas under us our good swords now  better the red eyed god of war ne'er wore  ravished our sides like age must run to rust and deck the temples of those gods that hate us these hands shall never draw 'em out like lightning to blast whole armies more 'tis too true arcite to our theban hounds that shook the agèd forest with their echoes no more now must we halloo no more shake our pointed javelins whilst the angry swine flies like a parthian quiver from our rages struck with our well steeled darts all valiant uses the food and nourishment of noble minds in us two here shall perish we shall die which is the curse of honor lastly children of grief and ignorance certainly 'tis a main goodness cousin

for all the fortune of my life hereafter yon little tree yon blooming apricock how i would spread and fling my wanton arms in at her window i would bring her fruit fit for the gods to feed on youth and pleasure still as she tasted should be doubled on her and if she be not heavenly i would make her so near the gods in nature they should fear her and then i am sure she would love me how now keeper where's arcite he's a blessèd man he shall see thebes again and call to arms the bold young men that when he bids 'em charge fall on like fire arcite shall have a fortune if he dare make himself a worthy lover yet in the field to strike a battle for her and if he lose her then he's a cold coward how bravely may he bear himself to win her if he be noble arcite thousand ways were i at

argument is love which if the goddess of it grant she gives victory too then blend your spirits with mine you whose free nobleness do make my cause your personal hazard to the goddess venus commend we our proceeding and implore her power unto our party hail sovereign queen of secrets who hast power to call the fiercest tyrant from his rage and weep unto a girl that hast the might even with an eye glance to choke mars's drum and turn th' alarm to whispers that canst make a cripple flourish with his crutch and cure him before apollo that mayst force the king to be his subject's vassal and induce stale gravity to dance the polled bachelor whose youth like wanton boys through bonfires have skipped thy flame at seventy thou canst catch and make him to the scorn of his hoarse throat abuse young lays of love what godlike power hast thou not power upon to phoebus thou add'st flames hotter than his the heavenly fires did scorch his mortal son thine him the huntress all moist and cold some say began to throw her bow away and sigh take to thy grace me thy vowed soldier who do bear thy yoke as 'twere a wreath of roses yet is heavier than lead itself stings more than nettles i have never been foul mouthed against thy law ne'er revealed secret for i knew none would not had i kenned all that were i never practiced upon man's wife nor would the libels read of liberal wits i never at great feasts sought to betray a beauty but have blushed at simp'ring sirs that did i have been harsh to large confessors and have hotly asked them if they had mothers i had one a woman and women 'twere they wronged i knew a man of eighty winters this i told them who a lass of fourteen brided 'twas thy power to put life into dust the agèd cramp had screwed his square foot round the gout had knit his fingers into knots torturing convulsions from his globy eyes had almost drawn their spheres that what was life in him seemed torture this anatomy had by his young fair fere a boy and i believed it was his for she swore it was and who would not believe her brief i am to those that prate and have done no companion to those that boast and have not a defier to those that would and cannot a rejoicer yea him i do not love that tells close offices the foulest way nor names concealments in the boldest language such a one i am and vow that lover never yet made sigh truer than i o then most soft sweet goddess give me the victory of this question which is true love's merit and bless me with a sign of thy great pleasure o thou that from eleven to ninety reign'st in mortal bosoms whose chase is this world and we in herds thy game i give thee thanks for this fair token which being laid unto mine innocent true heart arms in assurance my body to this business let us rise and bow before the goddess time comes on there's many a man alive that hath outlived the love o' th' people yea i' th' selfsame state stands many a father with his child some comfort we have by so considering we expire and not without men's pity to live still have their good wishes we prevent the loathsome misery of age beguile the gout and rheum that in lag hours attend for gray approachers we come towards the gods young and unwappered not halting under crimes many and stale that sure shall please the gods sooner than such to give us nectar with 'em for we are more clear spirits my dear kinsmen whose lives for this poor comfort are laid down you have sold 'em too too cheap e'en he that led you to this banquet shall taste to you all ah ha my friend my friend your gentle daughter gave me freedom once you'll see 't done now forever pray how does she i heard she was not well her kind of ill gave me some sorrow by my short life i am most glad on 't 'tis the latest thing i shall be glad of prithee tell her so commend me to her and to piece her portion tender her this verily i think so a right good creature more to me deserving than i can quit or speak of adieu and let my life be now as short as my leave taking can that be when venus i have said is false how do things fare what hath waked us from our dream o miserable end of our alliance the gods are mighty arcite if thy heart thy worthy manly heart be yet unbroken give me thy last words i am palamon one that yet loves thee dying thy brave soul seek elysium and i to honor o cousin that we should things desire which do cost us the loss of our desire that naught could buy dear love but loss of dear love
