where is the master boatswain hang cur hang you whoreson insolent noisemaker we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art we are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards this wide chopped rascal would thou mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides let's all sink wi' th' king the visitor will not give him o'er so fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue which of he or adrian for a good wager first begins to crow the cockerel a laughter ha ha ha he could not miss 't temperance was a delicate wench or as 'twere perfumed by a fen true save means to live the ground indeed is tawny he misses not much if but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies widow a pox o' that how came that widow in widow dido his word is more than the miraculous harp what impossible matter will he make easy next and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands why in good time and the rarest that e'er came there o widow dido ay widow dido that sort was well fished for and most chirurgeonly very foul he'd sow 't with nettle seed the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning none man all idle whores and knaves long live gonzalo 'twas you we laughed at what a blow was there given nay good my lord be not angry go sleep and hear us we two my lord will guard your person while you take your rest and watch your safety it is the quality o' th' climate nor i my spirits are nimble they fell together all as by consent they dropped as by a thunderstroke what might worthy sebastian o what might  no more and yet methinks i see it in thy face what thou shouldst be th' occasion speaks thee and my strong imagination sees a crown dropping upon thy head do you not hear me speak noble sebastian thou let'st thy fortune sleep die rather wink'st whiles thou art waking i am more serious than my custom you must be so too if heed me which to do trebles thee o'er i'll teach you how to flow o if you but knew how you the purpose cherish whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it you more invest it ebbing men indeed most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth thus sir although this lord of weak remembrance this who shall be of as little memory when he is earthed hath here almost persuaded  for he's a spirit of persuasion only professes to persuade the king his son's alive 'tis as impossible that he's undrowned as he that sleeps here swims o out of that no hope what great hope have you no hope that way is another way so high a hope that even ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond but doubt discovery there will you grant with me that ferdinand is drowned then tell me who's the next heir of naples she that is queen of tunis she that dwells ten leagues beyond man's life she that from naples can have no note unless the sun were post  the man i' th' moon's too slow till newborn chins be rough and razorable she that from whom we all were sea swallowed though some cast again and by that destiny to perform an act whereof what's past is prologue what to come in yours and my discharge a space whose ev'ry cubit seems to cry out how shall that claribel measure us back to naples keep in tunis and let sebastian wake say this were death that now hath seized them why they were no worse than now they are there be that can rule naples as well as he that sleeps lords that can prate as amply and unnecessarily as this gonzalo i myself could make a chough of as deep chat o that you bore the mind that i do what a sleep were this for your advancement do you understand me and how does your content tender your own good fortune true and look how well my garments sit upon me much feater than before my brother's servants were then my fellows now they are my men ay sir where lies that if 'twere a kibe 'twould put me to my slipper but i feel not this deity in my bosom twenty consciences that stand 'twixt me and milan candied be they and melt ere they molest here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon if he were that which now he's like that's dead  whom i with this obedient steel three inches of it can lay to bed forever whiles you doing thus to the perpetual wink for aye might put this ancient morsel this sir prudence who should not upbraid our course for all the rest they'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk they'll tell the clock to any business that we say befits the hour draw together and when i rear my hand do you the like to fall it on gonzalo then let us both be sudden o 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear to make an earthquake sure it was the roar of a whole herd of lions i am right glad that he's so out of hope do not for one repulse forgo the purpose that you resolved t' effect let it be tonight for now they are oppressed with travel they will not nor cannot use such vigilance as when they are fresh i'll believe both and what does else want credit come to me and i'll be sworn 'tis true travelers ne'er did lie though fools at home condemn 'em i'll be thy second very like one of them is a plain fish and no doubt marketable
