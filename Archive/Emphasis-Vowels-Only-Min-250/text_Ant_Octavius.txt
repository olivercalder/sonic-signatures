you may see lepidus and henceforth know it is not caesar's natural vice to hate our great competitor from alexandria this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy more womanly than he hardly gave audience or vouchsafed to think he had partners you shall find there a man who is th' abstract of all faults that all men follow you are too indulgent let's grant it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet with knaves that smells of sweat say this becomes him  as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemish yet must antony no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness if he filled his vacancy with his voluptuousness full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him for 't but to confound such time that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud as his own state and ours 'tis to be chid as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge pawn their experience to their present pleasure and so rebel to judgment i should have known no less it hath been taught us from the primal state that he which is was wished until he were and the ebbed man ne'er loved till ne'er worth love comes feared by being lacked this common body like to a vagabond flag upon the stream goes to and back lackeying the varying tide to rot itself with motion antony leave thy lascivious wassails when thou once was beaten from modena where thou slew'st hirsius and pansa consuls at thy heel did famine follow whom thou fought'st against though daintily brought up with patience more than savages could suffer thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets the barks of trees thou browsèd on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on and all this  it wounds thine honor that i speak it now  was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek so much as lanked not let his shames quickly drive him to rome 'tis time we twain did show ourselves i' th' field and to that end assemble we immediate council pompey thrives in our idleness till which encounter it is my business too farewell doubt not sir i knew it for my bond i do not know maecenas ask agrippa welcome to rome sit nay then i must be laughed at if or for nothing or a little i should say myself offended and with you chiefly i' th' world more laughed at that i should once name you derogately when to sound your name it not concerned me no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt yet if you there did practice on my state your being in egypt might be my question you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me your wife and brother made wars upon me and their contestation was theme for you you were the word of war you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patched up your excuses i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria you did pocket up my letters and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience you have broken the article of your oath which you shall never have tongue to charge me with to lend me arms and aid when i required them the which you both denied i do not much dislike the matter but the manner of his speech for 't cannot be we shall remain in friendship our conditions so diff'ring in their acts yet if i knew what hoop should hold us staunch from edge to edge o' th' world i would pursue it speak agrippa say not so agrippa if cleopatra heard you your reproof were well deserved of rashness not till he hears how antony is touched with what is spoke already the power of caesar and his power unto octavia there's my hand a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never fly off our loves again about the mount misena great and increasing but by sea he is an absolute master with most gladness and do invite you to my sister's view whither straight i'll lead you goodnight most meet that first we come to words and therefore have we our written purposes before us sent which if thou hast considered let us know if 'twill tie up thy discontented sword and carry back to sicily much tall youth that else must perish here take your time there's the point and what may follow to try a larger fortune that's our offer since i saw you last there's a change upon you that's the next to do show 's the way sir will this description satisfy him i could well forbear 't it's monstrous labor when i wash my brain and it grows fouler possess it i'll make answer but i had rather fast from all four days than drink so much in one cup us till the world go round cup us till the world go round what would you more pompey goodnight good brother let me request you off our graver business frowns at this levity gentle lords let's part you see we have burnt our cheeks strong enobarb is weaker than the wine and mine own tongue splits what it speaks the wild disguise hath almost anticked us all what needs more words goodnight good antony your hand you take from me a great part of myself use me well in 't sister prove such a wife as my thoughts make thee and as my farthest bond shall pass on thy approof most noble antony let not the piece of virtue which is set betwixt us as the cement of our love to keep it builded be the ram to batter the fortress of it for better might we have loved without this mean if on both parts this be not cherished i have said farewell my dearest sister fare thee well the elements be kind to thee and make thy spirits all of comfort fare thee well what octavia no sweet octavia you shall hear from me still the time shall not outgo my thinking on you adieu be happy farewell farewell contemning rome he has done all this and more in alexandria here's the manner of 't i' th' marketplace on a tribunal silvered cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned at the feet sat caesarion whom they call my father's son and all the unlawful issue that their lust since then hath made between them unto her he gave the stablishment of egypt made her of lower syria cyprus lydia absolute queen i' th' common showplace where they exercise his sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings great media parthia and armenia he gave to alexander to ptolemy he assigned syria cilicia and phoenicia she in th' habiliments of the goddess isis that day appeared and oft before gave audience as 'tis reported so the people knows it and have now received his accusations caesar and that having in sicily sextus pompeius spoiled we had not rated him his part o' th' isle then does he say he lent me some shipping unrestored lastly he frets that lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposed and being that we detain all his revenue 'tis done already and the messenger gone i have told him lepidus was grown too cruel that he his high authority abused and did deserve his change for what i have conquered i grant him part but then in his armenia and other of his conquered kingdoms i demand the like nor must not then be yielded to in this that ever i should call thee castaway why have you stol'n upon us thus you come not like caesar's sister the wife of antony should have an army for an usher and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear the trees by th' way should have borne men and expectation fainted longing for what it had not nay the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven raised by your populous troops but you are come a market maid to rome and have prevented the ostentation of our love which left unshown is often left unloved we should have met you by sea and land supplying every stage with an augmented greeting which soon he granted being an abstract 'tween his lust and him i have eyes upon him and his affairs come to me on the wind where is he now no my most wrongèd sister cleopatra hath nodded him to her he hath given his empire up to a whore who now are levying the kings o' th' earth for war he hath assembled bocchus the king of libya archelaus of cappadocia philadelphos king of paphlagonia the thracian king adallas king manchus of arabia king of pont herod of jewry mithridates king of comagen polemon and amyntas the kings of mede and lycaonia with a more larger list of scepters welcome hither your letters did withhold our breaking forth till we perceived both how you were wrong led and we in negligent danger cheer your heart be you not troubled with the time which drives o'er your content these strong necessities but let determined things to destiny hold unbewailed their way welcome to rome nothing more dear to me you are abused beyond the mark of thought and the high gods to do you justice makes his ministers of us and those that love you best of comfort and ever welcome to us most certain sister welcome pray you be ever known to patience my dear'st sister taurus strike not by land keep whole provoke not battle till we have done at sea do not exceed the prescript of this scroll our fortune lies upon this jump let him appear that's come from antony know you him approach and speak be 't so declare thine office for antony i have no ears to his request the queen of audience nor desire shall fail so she from egypt drive her all disgracèd friend or take his life there this if she perform she shall not sue unheard so to them both bring him through the bands to try thy eloquence now 'tis time dispatch from antony win cleopatra promise and in our name what she requires add more from thine invention offers women are not in their best fortunes strong but want will perjure the ne'er touched vestal try thy cunning thidias make thine own edict for thy pains which we will answer as a law observe how antony becomes his flaw and what thou think'st his very action speaks in every power that moves he calls me boy and chides as he had power to beat me out of egypt my messenger he hath whipped with rods dares me to personal combat caesar to antony let the old ruffian know i have many other ways to die meantime laugh at his challenge let our best heads know that tomorrow the last of many battles we mean to fight within our files there are of those that served mark antony but late enough to fetch him in see it done and feast the army we have store to do 't and they have earned the waste poor antony go forth agrippa and begin the fight our will is antony be took alive make it so known the time of universal peace is near prove this a prosp'rous day the three nooked world shall bear the olive freely go charge agrippa plant those that have revolted in the vant that antony may seem to spend his fury upon himself but being charged we will be still by land  which as i take 't we shall for his best force is forth to man his galleys to the vales and hold our best advantage go to him dolabella bid him yield being so frustrate tell him he mocks the pauses that he makes wherefore is that and what art thou that dar'st appear thus to us what is 't thou say'st the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack the round world should have shook lions into civil streets and citizens to their dens the death of antony is not a single doom in the name lay a moiety of the world look you sad friends the gods rebuke me but it is tidings to wash the eyes of kings o antony i have followed thee to this but we do lance diseases in our bodies i must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day or look on thine we could not stall together in the whole world but yet let me lament with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts that thou my brother my competitor in top of all design my mate in empire friend and companion in the front of war the arm of mine own body and the heart where mine his thoughts did kindle that our stars unreconciliable should divide our equalness to this hear me good friends  but i will tell you at some meeter season the business of this man looks out of him we'll hear him what he says whence are you bid her have good heart she soon shall know of us by some of ours how honorable and how kindly we determine for her for caesar cannot live to be ungentle come hither proculeius go and say we purpose her no shame give her what comforts the quality of her passion shall require lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke she do defeat us for her life in rome would be eternal in our triumph go and with your speediest bring us what she says and how you find of her gallus go you along where's dolabella to second proculeius let him alone for i remember now how he's employed he shall in time be ready go with me to my tent where you shall see how hardly i was drawn into this war how calm and gentle i proceeded still in all my writings go with me and see what i can show in this which is the queen of egypt arise you shall not kneel i pray you rise rise egypt take to you no hard thoughts the record of what injuries you did us though written in our flesh we shall remember as things but done by chance cleopatra know we will extenuate rather than enforce if you apply yourself to our intents which towards you are most gentle you shall find a benefit in this change but if you seek to lay on me a cruelty by taking antony's course you shall bereave yourself of my good purposes and put your children to that destruction which i'll guard them from if thereon you rely i'll take my leave you shall advise me in all for cleopatra nay blush not cleopatra i approve your wisdom in the deed good queen let us entreat you  forbear seleucus cleopatra not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged put we i' th' roll of conquest still be 't yours bestow it at your pleasure and believe caesar's no merchant to make prize with you of things that merchants sold therefore be cheered make not your thoughts your prisons no dear queen for we intend so to dispose you as yourself shall give us counsel feed and sleep our care and pity is so much upon you that we remain your friend and so adieu not so adieu bravest at the last she leveled at our purposes and being royal took her own way the manner of their deaths i do not see them bleed poisoned then o noble weakness if they had swallowed poison 'twould appear by external swelling but she looks like sleep as she would catch another antony in her strong toil of grace most probable that so she died for her physician tells me she hath pursued conclusions infinite of easy ways to die take up her bed and bear her women from the monument she shall be buried by her antony no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous high events as these strike those that make them and their story is no less in pity than his glory which brought them to be lamented our army shall in solemn show attend this funeral and then to rome come dolabella see high order in this great solemnity
