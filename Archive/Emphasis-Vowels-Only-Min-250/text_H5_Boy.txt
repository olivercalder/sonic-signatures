mine host pistol you must come to my master and your hostess he is very sick and would to bed good bardolph put thy face between his sheets and do the office of a warming pan faith he's very ill yes that he did and said they were devils incarnate he said once the devil would have him about women do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon bardolph's nose and he said it was a black soul burning in hell and that's but unwholesome food they say would i were in an alehouse in london i would give all my fame for a pot of ale and safety as duly but not as truly as bird doth sing on bough as young as i am i have observed these three swashers i am boy to them all three but all they three though they would serve me could not be man to me for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man for bardolph he is white livered and red faced by the means whereof he faces it out but fights not for pistol he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword by the means whereof he breaks words and keeps whole weapons for nym he hath heard that men of few words are the best men and therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest he should be thought a coward but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds for he never broke any man's head but his own and that was against a post when he was drunk they will steal anything and call it purchase bardolph stole a lute case bore it twelve leagues and sold it for three halfpence nym and bardolph are sworn brothers in filching and in calais they stole a fire shovel i knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals they would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my manhood if i should take from another's pocket to put into mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs i must leave them and seek some better service their villainy goes against my weak stomach and therefore i must cast it up écoutez comment êtes vous appelé he says his name is master fer i do not know the french for fer and ferret and firk il me commande à vous dire que vous faites vous prêt car ce soldat ici est disposé tout à cette heure de couper votre gorge he prays you to save his life he is a gentleman of a good house and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardonner aucun prisonnier néanmoins pour les écus que vous lui avez promis il est content à vous donner la liberté le franchisement he gives you upon his knees a thousand thanks and he esteems himself happy that he hath fall'n into the hands of one as he thinks the most brave valorous and thrice worthy seigneur of england suivez vous le grand capitaine i did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart but the saying is true the empty vessel makes the greatest sound bardolph and nym had ten times more valor than this roaring devil i' th' old play that everyone may pare his nails with a wooden dagger and they are both hanged and so would this be if he durst steal anything adventurously i must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp the french might have a good prey of us if he knew of it for there is none to guard it but boys
