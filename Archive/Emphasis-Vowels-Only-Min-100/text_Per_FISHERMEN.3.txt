what say you master faith master i am thinking of the poor men that were cast away before us even now nay master said not i as much when i saw the porpoise how he bounced and tumbled they say they're half fish half flesh a plague on them they ne'er come but i look to be washed master i marvel how the fishes live in the sea but master if i had been the sexton i would have been that day in the belfry because he should have swallowed me too and when i had been in his belly i would have kept such a jangling of the bells that he should never have left till he cast bells steeple church and parish up again but if the good king simonides were of my mind  we would purge the land of these drones that rob the bee of her honey
