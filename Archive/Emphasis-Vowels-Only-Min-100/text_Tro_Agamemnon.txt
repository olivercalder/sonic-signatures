princes what grief hath set the jaundice o'er your cheeks the ample proposition that hope makes in all designs begun on earth below fails in the promised largeness checks and disasters grow in the veins of actions highest reared as knots by the conflux of meeting sap infects the sound pine and diverts his grain tortive and errant from his course of growth nor princes is it matter new to us that we come short of our suppose so far that after seven years' siege yet troy walls stand sith every action that hath gone before whereof we have record trial did draw bias and thwart not answering the aim and that unbodied figure of the thought that gave 't surmisèd shape why then you princes do you with cheeks abashed behold our works and call them shames which are indeed naught else but the protractive trials of great jove to find persistive constancy in men the fineness of which metal is not found in fortune's love for then the bold and coward the wise and fool the artist and unread the hard and soft seem all affined and kin but in the wind and tempest of her frown distinction with a broad and powerful fan puffing at all winnows the light away and what hath mass or matter by itself lies rich in virtue and unmingled speak prince of ithaca and be 't of less expect that matter needless of importless burden divide thy lips than we are confident when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws we shall hear music wit and oracle the nature of the sickness found ulysses what is the remedy what trumpet look menelaus what would you 'fore our tent even this with surety stronger than achilles' arm 'fore all the greekish host which with one voice call agamemnon head and general how this trojan scorns us or the men of troy are ceremonious courtiers sir you of troy call you yourself

so himself this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas if none of them have soul in such a kind we left them all at home but we are soldiers and may that soldier a mere recreant prove that means not hath not or is not in love if then one is or hath or means to be that one meets hector if none else i am he fair lord aeneas let me touch your hand to our pavilion shall i lead you sir achilles shall have word of this intent so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent yourself shall feast with us before you go and find the welcome of a noble foe where is achilles let it be known to him that we are here he shent our messengers and we lay by our appertainments visiting of him let him be told so lest perchance he think we dare not move the question of our place or know not what we are hear you patroclus we are too well acquainted with these answers but his evasion winged thus swift with scorn cannot outfly our apprehensions much attribute he hath and much the reason why we ascribe it to him yet all his virtues not virtuously on his own part beheld do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss yea and like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish are like to rot untasted go and tell him we come to speak with him and you shall not sin if you do say we think him overproud and underhonest in self assumption greater than in the note of judgment and worthier than himself here tend the savage strangeness he puts on disguise the holy strength of their command and underwrite in an observing kind his humorous predominance yea watch his course and time his ebbs and flows as if the passage and whole carriage of this action rode on his tide go tell him this and add that if he overhold his price so much we'll none of him but let him like an engine not portable lie under this report bring action hither this cannot go to war a stirring dwarf we do allowance give before a sleeping giant tell him so in second voice we'll not be satisfied we come to speak with him ulysses enter you no more than what he thinks he is no question no noble ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractable your mind is the clearer ajax and your virtues the fairer he that is proud eats up himself pride is his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise what's his excuse why will he not upon our fair request untent his person and share th' air with us let ajax go to him  dear lord go you and greet him in his tent 'tis said he holds you well and will be led at your request a little from himself o no you shall not go he will be the physician that should be the patient go we to council let achilles sleep light boats sail swift though greater hulks draw deep what wouldst

hector will tomorrow be answered in his challenge ajax is ready we'll execute your purpose and put on a form of strangeness as we pass along so do each lord and either greet him not or else disdainfully which shall shake him more than if not looked on i will lead the way what says achilles would he aught with us the better here art thou in appointment fresh and fair anticipating time with starting courage give with thy trumpet a loud note to troy thou dreadful ajax that the appallèd air may pierce the head of the great combatant and hale him hither is not yond diomed with calchas'

gentle knight stand by our ajax as you and lord aeneas consent upon the order of their fight so be it either to the uttermost or else a breath the combatants being kin half stints their strife before their strokes begin what trojan is that same that looks so heavy they are in action his blows are well disposed there ajax worthy all arms as welcome as to one that would be rid of such an enemy  but that's no welcome understand more clear what's past and what's to come is strewed with husks and formless ruin of oblivion but in this extant moment faith and troth strained purely from all hollow bias drawing bids thee with most divine integrity from heart of very heart great hector welcome my well famed lord of troy no less to you first all you peers of greece go to my tent there in the full convive we afterwards as hector's leisure and your bounties shall concur together severally entreat him beat loud the taborins let the trumpets blow that this great soldier may his welcome know we go
