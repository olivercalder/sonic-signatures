dover how is 't my lord how look you but are my brother's powers set forth himself in person there lord edmund spake not with your lord at home what might import my sister's letter to him faith he is posted hence on serious matter it was great ignorance gloucester's eyes being out to let him live where he arrives he moves all hearts against us edmund i think is gone in pity of his misery to dispatch his nighted life moreover to descry the strength o' th' enemy our troops set forth tomorrow stay with us the ways are dangerous why should she write to edmund might not you transport her purposes by word belike some things i know not what i'll love thee much  let me unseal the letter i know your lady does not love her husband i am sure of that and at her late being here she gave
