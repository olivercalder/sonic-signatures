alas and woe thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly this sword but shown to caesar with this tidings shall enter me with him there diomed there i am called dercetus mark antony i served who best was worthy best to be served whilst he stood up and spoke he was my master and i wore my life to spend upon his haters if thou please to take me to thee as i was to him i'll be to caesar if thou pleasest not i yield thee up my life i say o caesar antony is dead he is dead caesar not by a public minister of justice nor by a hir√®d knife but that self hand which writ his honor in the acts it did hath with the courage which the heart did lend it splitted the heart this is his sword i robbed his wound of it behold it stained with his most noble blood dolabella
