my liege old gaunt commends him to your majesty nay nothing all is said his tongue is now a stringless instrument words life and all old lancaster hath spent well lords the duke of lancaster is dead richly in both if justice had her right nay speak thy mind and let him ne'er speak more that speaks thy words again to do thee harm now afore god 'tis shame such wrongs are borne in him a royal prince and many more of noble blood in this declining land the king is not himself but basely led by flatterers and what they will inform merely in hate 'gainst any of us all that will the king severely prosecute 'gainst us our lives our children and our heirs wars hath not wasted it for warred he hath not but basely yielded upon compromise that which his noble ancestors achieved with blows more hath he spent in peace than they in wars reproach and dissolution hangeth over him his noble kinsman most degenerate king but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm we see the wind sit sore upon our sails and yet we strike not but securely perish not so even through the hollow eyes of death i spy life peering but i dare not say how near the tidings of our comfort is then thus i have from le port blanc a bay in brittany received intelligence that harry duke of hereford rainold lord cobham that late broke from the duke of exeter his brother archbishop late of canterbury sir thomas erpingham sir john ramston sir john norbery sir robert waterton and francis coint  all these well furnished by the duke of brittany with eight tall ships three thousand men of war are making hither with all due expedience and shortly mean to touch our northern shore perhaps they had ere this but that they stay the first departing of the king for ireland if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke imp out our drooping country's broken wing redeem from broking pawn the blemished crown wipe off the dust that hides our scepter's gilt and make high majesty look like itself away with me in post to ravenspurgh but if you faint as fearing to do so stay and be secret and myself will go believe me noble lord i am a stranger here in gloucestershire these high wild hills and rough uneven ways draws out our miles and makes them wearisome and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar making the hard way sweet and delectable but i bethink me what a weary way from ravenspurgh to cotshall will be found in ross and willoughby wanting your company which i protest hath very much beguiled the tediousness and process of my travel but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have the present benefit which i possess and hope to joy is little less in joy than hope enjoyed by this the weary lords shall make their way seem short as mine hath done by sight of what i have your noble company it is my son young harry percy sent from my brother worcester whencesoever  harry how fares your uncle why is he not with the queen what was his reason he was not so resolved when last we spake together have you forgot the duke of hereford boy then learn to know him now this is the duke how far is it to berkeley and what stir keeps good old york there with his men of war here come the lords of ross and willoughby bloody with spurring fiery red with haste it is my lord of berkeley as i guess the noble duke hath been too much abused the noble duke hath sworn his coming is but for his own and for the right of that we all have strongly sworn to give him aid and let him never see joy that breaks that oath the news is very fair and good my lord richard not far from hence hath hid his head your grace mistakes only to be brief left i his title out o belike it is the bishop of carlisle the king of heaven forbid our lord the king should so with civil and uncivil arms be rushed upon thy thrice noble cousin harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand and by the honorable tomb he swears that stands upon your royal grandsire's bones and by the royalties of both your bloods currents that spring from one most gracious head and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt and by the worth and honor of himself comprising all that may be sworn or said his coming hither hath no further scope than for his lineal royalties and to beg enfranchisement immediate on his knees which on thy royal party granted once his glittering arms he will commend to rust his barbèd steeds to stables and his heart to faithful service of your majesty this swears he as he is a prince and just and as i am a gentleman i credit him my lord in the base court he doth attend to speak with you may
