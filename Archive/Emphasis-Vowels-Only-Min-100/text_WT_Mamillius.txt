ay my good lord yes if you will my lord no my lord i'll fight i am like you they say no i'll none of you you'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if i were a baby still i love you better not for because your brows are blacker yet black brows they say become some women best so that there be not too much hair there but in a semicircle or a half moon made with a pen i learned it out of women's faces pray now what color are your eyebrows nay that's a mock i have seen a lady's nose that has been blue but not her eyebrows merry or sad shall 't be a sad tale's best for winter i have one of sprites and goblins there was a man  dwelt by a churchyard i will tell it softly yond crickets shall not hear it
