fellow follow us for thy reward i muse my lord of gloucester is not come 'tis not his wont to be the hindmost man whate'er occasion keeps him from us now my lords at once the care you have of us to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience our kinsman gloucester is as innocent from meaning treason to our royal person as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove the duke is virtuous mild and too well given to dream on evil or to work my downfall welcome lord somerset what news from france cold news lord somerset but god's will be done my lord of gloucester 'tis my special hope that you will clear yourself from all suspense my conscience tells me you are innocent my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best do or undo as if ourself were here ay margaret my heart is drowned with grief whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes my body round engirt with misery for what's more miserable than discontent ah uncle humphrey in thy face i see the map of honor truth and loyalty and yet good humphrey is the hour to come that e'er i proved thee false or feared thy faith what louring star now envies thy estate that these great lords and margaret our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong and as the butcher takes away the calf and binds the wretch and beats it when it strains bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse even so remorseless have they borne him hence and as the dam runs lowing up and down looking the way her harmless young one went and can do naught but wail her darling's loss even so myself bewails good gloucester's case with sad unhelpful tears and with dimmed eyes look after him and cannot do him good so mighty are his vowèd enemies his fortunes i will weep and 'twixt each groan say who's a traitor gloucester he is none go call our uncle to our presence straight say we intend to try his grace today if he be guilty as 'tis publishèd lords take your places and i pray you all proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle gloucester than from true evidence of good esteem he be approved in practice culpable i thank thee meg these words content me much how now why look'st thou pale why tremblest thou where is our uncle what's the matter suffolk o heavenly god what doth my lord of suffolk comfort me came he right now to sing a raven's note whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers and thinks he that the chirping of a wren by crying comfort from a hollow breast can chase away the first conceivèd sound hide not thy poison with such sugared words lay not thy hands on me forbear i say their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting thou baleful messenger out of my sight upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny sits in grim majesty to fright the world look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding yet do not go away come basilisk and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight for in the shade of death i shall find joy in life but double death now gloucester's dead ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man that he is dead good warwick 'tis too true but how he died god knows not henry enter his chamber view his breathless corpse and comment then upon his sudden death o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts my thoughts that labor to persuade my soul some violent hands were laid on humphrey's life if my suspect be false forgive me god for judgment only doth belong to thee fain would i go to chafe his paly lips with twenty thousand kisses and to drain upon his face an ocean of salt tears to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling but all in vain are these mean obsequies and to survey his dead and earthy image what were it but to make my sorrow greater that is to see how deep my grave is made for with his soul fled all my worldly solace for seeing him i see my life in death what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just and he but naked though locked up in steel whose conscience with injustice is corrupted why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn here in our presence dare you be so bold why what tumultuous clamor have we here go salisbury and tell them all from me i thank them for their tender loving care and had i not been cited so by them yet did i purpose as they do entreat for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy mischance unto my state by suffolk's means and therefore by his majesty i swear whose far unworthy deputy i am he shall not breathe infection in this air but three days longer on the pain of death ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk no more i say if thou dost plead for him thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath had i but said i would have kept my word but when i swear it is irrevocable if after three days' space thou here be'st found on any ground that i am ruler of the world shall not be ransom for thy life  come warwick come good warwick go with me i have great matters to impart to thee how fares my lord speak beaufort to thy sovereign ah what a sign it is of evil life where death's approach is seen so terrible o thou eternal mover of the heavens look with a gentle eye upon this wretch o beat away the busy meddling fiend that lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul and from his bosom purge this black despair peace to his soul if god's good pleasure be  lord card'nal if thou think'st on heaven's bliss hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope he dies and makes no sign o god forgive him forbear to judge for we are sinners all close up his eyes and draw the curtain close and let us all to meditation i'll send some holy bishop to entreat for god forbid so many simple souls should perish by the sword and i myself rather than bloody war shall cut them short will parley with jack cade their general but stay i'll read it over once again lord saye jack cade hath sworn to have thy head how now madam still lamenting and mourning for suffolk's death i fear me love if that i had been dead thou wouldst not have mourned so much for me how now what news why com'st thou in such haste o graceless men they know not what they do lord saye the traitors hateth thee therefore away with us to killingworth come margaret god our hope will succor us farewell my lord trust not the kentish rebels was ever king that joyed an earthly throne and could command no more content than i no sooner was i crept out of my cradle but i was made a king at nine months old was never subject longed to be a king as i do long and wish to be a subject why buckingham is the traitor cade surprised or is he but retired to make him strong then heaven set ope thy everlasting gates to entertain my vows of thanks and praise soldiers this day have you redeemed your lives and showed how well you love your prince and country continue still in this so good a mind and henry though he be infortunate assure yourselves will never be unkind and so with thanks and pardon to you all i do dismiss you to your several countries thus stands my state 'twixt cade and york distressed like to a ship that having scaped a tempest is straightway calmed and boarded with a pirate but now is cade driven back his men dispersed and now is york in arms to second him i pray thee buckingham go and meet him and ask him what's the reason of these arms tell him i'll send duke edmund to the tower  and somerset we will commit thee thither until his army be dismissed from him in any case be not too rough in terms for he is fierce and cannot brook hard language come wife let's in and learn to govern better for yet may england curse my wretched reign buckingham doth york intend no harm to us that thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm then what intends these forces thou dost bring the head of cade great god how just art thou o let me view his visage being dead that living wrought me such exceeding trouble tell me my friend art thou the man that slew him how art thou called and what is thy degree iden kneel down rise up a knight we give thee for reward a thousand marks and will that thou henceforth attend on us see buckingham somerset comes with th' queen go bid her hide him quickly from the duke ay clifford a bedlam and ambitious humor makes him oppose himself against his king why warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow  old salisbury shame to thy silver hair thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son what wilt thou on thy deathbed play the ruffian and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles o where is faith o where is loyalty if it be banished from the frosty head where shall it find a harbor in the earth wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war and shame thine honorable age with blood why art thou old and want'st experience or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it for shame in duty bend thy knee to me that bows unto the grave with mickle age hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath call buckingham and bid him arm himself can we outrun the heavens good margaret stay
