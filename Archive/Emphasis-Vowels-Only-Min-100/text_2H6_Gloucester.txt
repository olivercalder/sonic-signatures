peers of england pillars of the state to you duke humphrey must unload his grief your grief the common grief of all the land what did my brother henry spend his youth his valor coin and people in the wars did he so often lodge in open field in winter's cold and summer's parching heat to conquer france his true inheritance and did my brother bedford toil his wits to keep by policy what henry got have you yourselves somerset buckingham brave york salisbury and victorious warwick received deep scars in france and normandy or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself with all the learn√®d council of the realm studied so long sat in the council house early and late debating to and fro how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe and had his highness in his infancy crowned in paris in despite of foes and shall these labors and these honors die shall henry's conquest bedford's vigilance your deeds of war and all our counsel die o peers of england shameful is this league fatal this marriage cancelling your fame blotting your names from books of memory razing the characters of your renown defacing monuments of conquered france undoing all as all had never been ay uncle we will keep it if we can but now it is impossible we should suffolk the new made duke that rules the roast hath given the duchy of anjou and maine unto the poor king reignier whose large style agrees not with the leanness of his purse a proper jest and never heard before that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth for costs and charges in transporting her she should have stayed in france and starved in france before  my lord of winchester i know your mind 'tis not my speeches that you do mislike but 'tis my presence that doth trouble you rancor will out proud prelate in thy face i see thy fury if i longer stay we shall begin our ancient bickerings  lordings farewell and say when i am gone i prophesied france will be lost ere long o nell sweet nell if thou dost love thy lord banish the canker of ambitious thoughts and may that hour when i imagine ill against my king and nephew virtuous henry be my last breathing in this mortal world my troublous dreams this night doth make me sad methought this staff mine office badge in court was broke in twain by whom i have forgot but as i think it was by th' cardinal  and on the pieces of the broken wand were placed the heads of edmund duke of somerset and william de la pole first duke of suffolk this was my dream what it doth bode god knows nay eleanor then must i chide outright presumptuous dame ill nurtured eleanor art thou not second woman in the realm and the protector's wife beloved of him hast thou not worldly pleasure at command above the reach or compass of thy thought and wilt thou still be hammering treachery to tumble down thy husband and thyself from top of honor to disgrace's feet away from me and let me hear no more nay be not angry i am pleased again i go come nell thou wilt ride with us madam the king is old enough himself to give his censure these are no women's matters madam i am protector of the realm and at his pleasure will resign my place now lords my choler being overblown with walking once about the quadrangle i come to talk of commonwealth affairs as for your spiteful false objections prove them and i lie open to the law but god in mercy so deal with my soul as i in duty love my king and country but to the matter that we have in hand i say my sovereign york is meetest man to be your regent in the realm of france this doom my lord if i may judge let somerset be regent o'er the french because in york this breeds suspicion and let these have a day appointed them for single combat in convenient place for he hath witness of his servant's malice this is the law and this duke humphrey's doom sirrah or you must fight or else be hanged my lord 'tis but a base ignoble mind that mounts no higher than a bird can soar ay my lord cardinal how think you by that were it not good your grace could fly to heaven what cardinal is your priesthood grown peremptory tantaene animis caelestibus irae churchmen so hot good uncle hide such malice with such holiness can you do it as who my lord why suffolk england knows thine insolence faith holy uncle would 't were come to that make up no factious numbers for the matter in thine own person answer thy abuse true uncle are you advised the east side of the grove talking of hawking nothing else my lord now by god's mother priest i'll shave your crown for this or all my fence shall fail what means this noise  fellow what miracle dost thou proclaim stand by my masters bring him near the king his highness' pleasure is to talk with him hadst thou been his mother thou couldst have better told how long hast thou been blind what and wouldst climb a tree mass thou lov'dst plums well that wouldst venture so a subtle knave but yet it shall not serve  let me see thine eyes wink now now open them in my opinion yet thou seest not well sayst thou me so what color is this cloak of why that's well said what color is my gown of but cloaks and gowns before this day a many tell me sirrah what's my name what's his name nor his what's thine own name then sander sit there the lying'st knave in christendom if thou hadst been born blind thou mightst as well have known all our names as thus to name the several colors we do wear sight may distinguish of colors but suddenly to nominate them all it is impossible my lords saint alban here hath done a miracle and would you not think his cunning to be great that could restore this cripple to his legs again my masters of saint albans have you not beadles in your town and things called whips then send for one presently now fetch me a stool hither by and by now sirrah if you mean to save yourself from whipping leap me over this stool and run away well sir we must have you find your legs sirrah beadle whip him till he leap over that same stool follow the knave and take this drab away let them be whipped through every market town till they come to berwick from whence they came but you have done more miracles than i you made in a day my lord whole towns to fly ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart sorrow and grief have vanquished all my powers and vanquished as i am i yield to thee or to the meanest groom madam for myself to heaven i do appeal how i have loved my king and commonweal and for my wife i know not how it stands sorry i am to hear what i have heard noble she is but if she have forgot honor and virtue and conversed with such as like to pitch defile nobility i banish her my bed and company and give her as a prey to law and shame that hath dishonored gloucester's honest name eleanor the law thou seest hath judged thee i cannot justify whom the law condemns mine eyes are full of tears my heart of grief ah humphrey this dishonor in thine age will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground  i beseech your majesty give me leave to go sorrow would solace and mine age would ease my staff here noble henry is my staff as willingly do i the same resign as e'er thy father henry made it mine and even as willingly at thy feet i leave it as others would ambitiously receive it farewell good king when i am dead and gone may honorable peace attend thy throne thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud and after summer evermore succeeds barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold so cares and joys abound as seasons fleet sirs what's o'clock ten is the hour that was appointed me to watch the coming of my punished duchess uneath may she endure the flinty streets to tread them with her tender feeling feet sweet nell ill can thy noble mind abrook the abject people gazing on thy face with envious looks laughing at thy shame that erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels when thou didst ride in triumph through the streets but soft i think she comes and i'll prepare my tearstained eyes to see her miseries no stir not for your lives let her pass by be patient gentle nell forget this grief ah nell forbear thou aimest all awry i must offend before i be attainted and had i twenty times so many foes and each of them had twenty times their power all these could not procure me any scathe so long as i am loyal true and crimeless wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach why yet thy scandal were not wiped away but i in danger for the breach of law thy greatest help is quiet gentle nell i pray thee sort thy heart to patience these few days' wonder will be quickly worn and my consent ne'er asked herein before this is close dealing well i will be there my nell i take my leave and master sheriff let not her penance exceed the king's commission must you sir john protect my lady here entreat her not the worse in that i pray you use her well the world may laugh again and i may live to do you kindness if you do it her and so sir john farewell witness my tears i cannot stay to speak all happiness unto my lord the king pardon my liege that i have stayed so long well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush nor change my countenance for this arrest a heart unspotted is not easily daunted the purest spring is not so free from mud as i am clear from treason to my sovereign who can accuse me wherein am i guilty is it but thought so what are they that think it i never robbed the soldiers of their pay nor ever had one penny bribe from france so help me god as i have watched the night  ay night by night in studying good for england that doit that e'er i wrested from the king or any groat i hoarded to my use be brought against me at my trial day no many a pound of mine own proper store because i would not tax the needy commons have i dispurs√®d to the garrisons and never asked for restitution i say no more than truth so help me god why 'tis well known that whiles i was protector pity was all the fault that was in me for i should melt at an offender's tears and lowly words were ransom for their fault unless it were a bloody murderer or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers i never gave them condign punishment murder indeed that bloody sin i tortured above the felon or what trespass else ah gracious lord these days are dangerous virtue is choked with foul ambition and charity chased hence by rancor's hand foul subornation is predominant and equity exiled your highness' land i know their complot is to have my life and if my death might make this island happy and prove the period of their tyranny i would expend it with all willingness but mine is made the prologue to their play for thousands more that yet suspect no peril will not conclude their plotted tragedy beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice and suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate sharp buckingham unburdens with his tongue the envious load that lies upon his heart and dogged york that reaches at the moon whose overweening arm i have plucked back by false accuse doth level at my life  and you my sovereign lady with the rest causeless have laid disgraces on my head and with your best endeavor have stirred up my liefest liege to be mine enemy ay all of you have laid your heads together  myself had notice of your conventicles  and all to make away my guiltless life i shall not want false witness to condemn me nor store of treasons to augment my guilt the ancient proverb will be well effected a staff is quickly found to beat a dog far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed beshrew the winners for they played me false and well such losers may have leave to speak ah thus king henry throws away his crutch before his legs be firm to bear his body  thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first ah that my fear were false ah that it were for good king henry thy decay i fear
