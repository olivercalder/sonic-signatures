truly sir in respect of a fine workman i am but as you would say a cobbler a trade sir that i hope i may use with a safe conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles nay i beseech you sir be not out with me yet if you be out sir i can mend you why sir cobble you truly sir all that i live by is with the awl i meddle with no tradesman's matters nor women's matters but withal i am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in great danger i recover them as proper men as ever trod upon neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work but indeed sir we make holiday to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph
