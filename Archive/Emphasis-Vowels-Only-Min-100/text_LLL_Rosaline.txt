another of these students at that time was there with him if i have heard a truth berowne they call him but a merrier man within the limit of becoming mirth i never spent an hour's talk withal his eye begets occasion for his wit for every object that the one doth catch the other turns to a mirth moving jest which his fair tongue conceit's expositor delivers in such apt and gracious words that agèd ears play truant at his tales and younger hearings are quite ravishèd so sweet and voluble is his discourse did not i dance with you in brabant once how needless was it then to ask the question 'tis long of you that spur me with such questions not till it leave the rider in the mire the hour that fools should ask fair fall the face it covers amen so you be none pray you do my commendations i would be glad to see it is the fool sick alack let it blood my physic says ay no point with my knife and yours from long living then was venus like her mother for her father is but grim shall i teach you to know why she that bears the bow finely put off well then i am the shooter if we choose by the horns yourself come not near finely put on indeed shall i come upon thee with an old saying that was a man when king pippen of france was a little boy as touching the hit it thou canst not hit it hit it hit it thou canst not hit it my good man madam came nothing else along with that that was the way to make his godhead wax for he hath been five thousand year a boy you'll ne'er be friends with him he killed your sister what's your dark meaning mouse of this light word we need more light to find your meaning out look what you do you do it still i' th' dark indeed i weigh not you and therefore light great reason for past care is still past cure i would you knew an if my face were but as fair as yours my favor were as great be witness this nay i have verses too i thank berowne the numbers true and were the numb'ring too i were the fairest goddess on the ground i am compared to twenty thousand fairs o he hath drawn my picture in his letter much in the letters nothing in the praise ware pencils ho let me not die your debtor my red dominical my golden letter o that your face were not so full of o's they are worse fools to purchase mocking so that same berowne i'll torture ere i go o that i knew he were but in by th' week how i would make him fawn and beg and seek and wait the season and observe the times and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes and shape his service wholly to my hests and make him proud to make me proud that jests so pair taunt like would i o'ersway his state that he should be my fool and i his fate the blood of youth burns not with such excess as gravity's revolt to wantonness come on then wear the favors most in sight but shall we dance if they desire us to 't what would these strangers know their minds boyet if they do speak our language 'tis our will that some plain man recount their purposes know what they would what would they say they why that they have and bid them so be gone it is not so ask them how many inches is in one mile if they have measured many the measure then of one is eas'ly told how many weary steps of many weary miles you have o'ergone are numbered in the travel of one mile my face is but a moon and clouded too o vain petitioner beg a greater matter thou now requests but moonshine in the water play music then nay you must do it soon not yet no dance thus change i like the moon you took the moon at full but now she's changed our ears vouchsafe it since you are strangers and come here by chance we'll not be nice take hands we will not dance only to part friends  curtsy sweethearts and so the measure ends we can afford no more at such a price your absence only then cannot we be bought and so adieu  twice to your visor and half once to you in private then not one word more my maids break off break off well liking wits they have gross gross fat fat they were all in lamentable cases the king was weeping ripe for a good word well better wits have worn plain statute caps but will you hear the king is my love sworn good madam if by me you'll be advised let's mock them still as well known as disguised let us complain to them what fools were here disguised like muscovites in shapeless gear and wonder what they were and to what end their shallow shows and prologue vilely penned and their rough carriage so ridiculous should be presented at our tent to us madam speak true it is not so my lord my lady to the manner of the days in courtesy gives undeserving praise we four indeed confronted were with four in russian habit here they stayed an hour and talked apace and in that hour my lord they did not bless us with one happy word i dare not call them fools but this i think when they are thirsty fools would fain have drink this proves you wise and rich for in my eye  but that you take what doth to you belong it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue all the fool mine which of the vizards was it that you wore there then that vizard that superfluous case that hid the worse and showed the better face help hold his brows he'll swoon why look you pale seasick i think coming from muscovy sans sans i pray you it is not so for how can this be true that you stand forfeit being those that sue nor shall not if i do as i intend madam he swore that he did hold me dear as precious eyesight and did value me above this world adding thereto moreover that he would wed me or else die my lover by heaven you did and to confirm it plain you gave me this but take it sir again we did not quote them so oft have i heard of you my lord berowne before i saw you and the world's large tongue proclaims you for a man replete with mocks full of comparisons and wounding flouts which you on all estates will execute that lie within the mercy of your wit to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain and therewithal to win me if you please without the which i am not to be won you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day visit the speechless sick and still converse with groaning wretches and your task shall be with all the fierce endeavor of your wit to enforce the painèd impotent to smile why that's the way to choke a gibing spirit whose influence is begot of that loose grace which shallow laughing hearers give to fools a jest's prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it never in the tongue of him that makes it then if sickly ears deafed with the clamors of their own dear groans will hear your idle scorns continue then and i will have you and that fault withal but if they will not throw away that spirit and i shall find you empty of that fault right joyful of your reformation
