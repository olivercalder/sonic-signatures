'tis some mischance the voice is very direful here's one comes in his shirt with light and weapons this is othello's ancient as i take it cassio i am sorry to find you thus i have been to seek you what of venice know him ay i am glad to see you roderigo what is the matter o heavens forfend 'tis a strange truth poor desdemon i am glad thy father's dead thy match was mortal to him and pure grief shore his old thread in twain did he live now this sight would make him do a desperate turn yea curse his better angel from his side and fall to reprobance fie your sword upon a woman the woman falls sure he hath killed his wife he's gone but his wife's killed if thou attempt it it will cost thee dear thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer what is the matter torments will ope your lips all that is spoke is marred
