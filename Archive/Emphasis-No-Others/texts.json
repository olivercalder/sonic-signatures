{"R3_RichardIII": "now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of york and all the clouds that loured upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruis\u00e8d arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changed to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures grim visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barb\u00e8d steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous looking glass i that am rudely stamped and want love's majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph i that am curtailed of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deformed unfinished sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them  why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to see my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair well spoken days i am determin\u00e8d to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mewed up about a prophecy which says that g of edward's heirs the murderer shall be dive thoughts down to my soul here clarence comes brother good day what means this arm\u00e8d guard that waits upon your grace upon what cause alack my lord that fault is none of yours he should for that commit your godfathers o belike his majesty hath some intent that you should be new christened in the tower but what's the matter clarence may i know why this it is when men are ruled by women 'tis not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife clarence 'tis she that tempers him to this extremity was it not she and that good man of worship anthony woodeville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is delivered we are not safe clarence we are not safe humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty i'll tell you what i think it is our way if we will keep in favor with the king to be her men and wear her livery the jealous o'erworn widow and herself since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen are mighty gossips in our monarchy even so an please your worship brakenbury you may partake of anything we say we speak no treason man we say the king is wise and virtuous and his noble queen well struck in years fair and not jealous we say that shore's wife hath a pretty foot a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue and that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks how say you sir can you deny all this naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow he that doth naught with her excepting one were best to do it secretly alone we are the queen's abjects and must obey  brother farewell i will unto the king and whatsoe'er you will employ me in were it to call king edward's widow sister i will perform it to enfranchise you meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine well your imprisonment shall not be long i will deliver you or else lie for you meantime have patience go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return simple plain clarence i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven if heaven will take the present at our hands but who comes here the new delivered hastings as much unto my good lord chamberlain well are you welcome to the open air how hath your lordship brooked imprisonment no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too for they that were your enemies are his and have prevailed as much on him as you what news abroad now by saint john that news is bad indeed o he hath kept an evil diet long and overmuch consumed his royal person 'tis very grievous to be thought upon where is he in his bed go you before and i will follow you he cannot live i hope and must not die till george be packed with post horse up to heaven i'll in to urge his hatred more to clarence with lies well steeled with weighty arguments and if i fail not in my deep intent clarence hath not another day to live which done god take king edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in for then i'll marry warwick's youngest daughter what though i killed her husband and her father the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father the which will i not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto but yet i run before my horse to market clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns when they are gone then must i count my gains stay you that bear the corse and set it down villains set down the corse or by saint paul i'll make a corse of him that disobeys unmannered dog stand thou when i command  advance thy halberd higher than my breast or by saint paul i'll strike thee to my foot and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness sweet saint for charity be not so curst lady you know no rules of charity which renders good for bad blessings for curses but i know none and therefore am no beast more wonderful when angels are so angry vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman of these suppos\u00e8d crimes to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself fairer than tongue can name thee let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself by such despair i should accuse myself say that i slew them not i did not kill your husband nay he is dead and slain by edward's hands i was provok\u00e8d by her sland'rous tongue that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders i grant you the better for the king of heaven that hath him let him thank me that holp to send him thither for he was fitter for that place than earth yes one place else if you will hear me name it your bedchamber so will it madam till i lie with you i know so but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall something into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner your beauty was the cause of that effect  your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom these eyes could not endure that beauty's wrack you should not blemish it if i stood by as all the world is cheer\u00e8d by the sun so i by that it is my day my life curse not thyself fair creature thou art both it is a quarrel most unnatural to be revenged on him that loveth thee he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband he lives that loves thee better than he could plantagenet the selfsame name but one of better nature here why dost thou spit at me never came poison from so sweet a place thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears shamed their aspects with store of childish drops these eyes which never shed remorseful tear  no when my father york and edward wept to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when black faced clifford shook his sword at him nor when thy warlike father like a child told the sad story of my father's death and twenty times made pause to sob and weep that all the standers by had wet their cheeks like trees bedashed with rain in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is proposed my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made for kissing lady not for such contempt if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive lo here i lend thee this sharp pointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true breast and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee nay do not pause for i did kill king henry  but 'twas thy beauty that provok\u00e8d me nay now dispatch 'twas i that stabbed young edward  but 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on take up the sword again or take up me then bid me kill myself and i will do it that was in thy rage speak it again and even with the word this hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths shalt thou be accessory 'tis figured in my tongue then never was man true say then my peace is made but shall i live in hope vouchsafe to wear this ring look how my ring encompasseth thy finger even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart wear both of them for both of them are thine and if thy poor devoted servant may but beg one favor at thy gracious hand thou dost confirm his happiness forever that it may please you leave these sad designs to him that hath most cause to be a mourner and presently repair to crosby house where after i have solemnly interred at chertsey monast'ry this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears i will with all expedient duty see you for divers unknown reasons i beseech you grant me this boon bid me farewell no to whitefriars there attend my coming was ever woman in this humor wooed was ever woman in this humor won i'll have her but i will not keep her long what i that killed her husband and his father to take her in her heart's extremest hate with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes the bleeding witness of my hatred by having god her conscience and these bars against me and i no friends to back my suit at all but the plain devil and dissembling looks and yet to win her all the world to nothing ha hath she forgot already that brave prince edward her lord whom i some three months since stabbed in my angry mood at tewkesbury a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman framed in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal the spacious world cannot again afford and will she yet abase her eyes on me that cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woeful bed on me whose all not equals edward's moiety on me that halts and am misshapen thus my dukedom to a beggarly denier i do mistake my person all this while upon my life she finds although i cannot myself to be a marv'lous proper man i'll be at charges for a looking glass and entertain a score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body since i am crept in favor with myself i will maintain it with some little cost but first i'll turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass that i may see my shadow as i pass they do me wrong and i will not endure it who is it that complains unto the king that i forsooth am stern and love them not by holy paul they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumors because i cannot flatter and look fair smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog duck with french nods and apish courtesy i must be held a rancorous enemy cannot a plain man live and think no harm but thus his simple truth must be abused with silken sly insinuating jacks to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace when have i injured thee when done thee wrong  or thee or thee or any of your faction a plague upon you all his royal grace whom god preserve better than you would wish cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while but you must trouble him with lewd complaints i cannot tell the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch since every jack became a gentleman there's many a gentle person made a jack meantime god grants that we have need of you our brother is imprisoned by your means myself disgraced and the nobility held in contempt while great promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble you may deny that you were not the mean of my lord hastings' late imprisonment she may lord rivers why who knows not so she may do more sir than denying that she may help you to many fair preferments and then deny her aiding hand therein and lay those honors on your high desert what may she not she may ay marry may she  what marry may she marry with a king a bachelor and a handsome stripling too iwis your grandam had a worser match what threat you me with telling of the king tell him and spare not look what i have said i will avouch 't in presence of the king i dare adventure to be sent to th' tower 'tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot ere you were queen ay or your husband king i was a packhorse in his great affairs a weeder out of his proud adversaries a liberal rewarder of his friends to royalize his blood i spent mine own in all which time you and your husband grey were factious for the house of lancaster  and rivers so were you was not your husband in margaret's battle at saint albans slain let me put in your minds if you forget what you have been ere this and what you are withal what i have been and what i am poor clarence did forsake his father warwick ay and forswore himself which jesu pardon  to fight on edward's party for the crown and for his meed poor lord he is mewed up i would to god my heart were flint like edward's or edward's soft and pitiful like mine i am too childish foolish for this world if i should be i had rather be a peddler far be it from my heart the thought thereof foul wrinkled witch what mak'st thou in my sight wert thou not banish\u00e8d on pain of death the curse my noble father laid on thee when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper and with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes and then to dry them gav'st the duke a clout steeped in the faultless blood of pretty rutland  his curses then from bitterness of soul denounced against thee are all fall'n upon thee and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed have done thy charm thou hateful withered hag margaret ha i cry thee mercy then for i did think that thou hadst called me all these bitter names 'tis done by me and ends in margaret good counsel marry learn it learn it marquess ay and much more but i was born so high our aerie buildeth in the cedar's top and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun what doth she say my lord of buckingham i cannot blame her by god's holy mother she hath had too much wrong and i repent my part thereof that i have done to her yet you have all the vantage of her wrong i was too hot to do somebody good that is too cold in thinking of it now marry as for clarence he is well repaid he is franked up to fatting for his pains god pardon them that are the cause thereof so do i ever being well advised for had i cursed now i had cursed myself i do the wrong and first begin to brawl the secret mischiefs that i set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others clarence who i indeed have cast in darkness i do beweep to many simple gulls namely to derby hastings buckingham and tell them 'tis the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke my brother now they believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on rivers dorset grey but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that god bids us do good for evil and thus i clothe my naked villainy with odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil but soft here come my executioners  how now my hardy stout resolv\u00e8d mates are you now going to dispatch this thing well thought upon i have it here about me when you have done repair to crosby place but sirs be sudden in the execution withal obdurate do not hear him plead for clarence is well spoken and perhaps may move your hearts to pity if you mark him your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall tears i like you lads about your business straight go go dispatch good morrow to my sovereign king and queen and princely peers a happy time of day a bless\u00e8d labor my most sovereign lord among this princely heap if any here by false intelligence or wrong surmise hold me a foe if i unwittingly or in my rage have aught committed that is hardly borne by any in this presence i desire to reconcile me to his friendly peace 'tis death to me to be at enmity i hate it and desire all good men's love first madam i entreat true peace of you which i will purchase with my duteous service  of you my noble cousin buckingham if ever any grudge were lodged between us  of you and you lord rivers and of dorset that all without desert have frowned on me  of you lord woodeville and lord scales of you dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all i do not know that englishman alive with whom my soul is any jot at odds more than the infant that is born tonight i thank my god for my humility why madam have i offered love for this to be so flouted in this royal presence who knows not that the gentle duke is dead you do him injury to scorn his corse but he poor man by your first order died and that a wing\u00e8d mercury did bear some tardy cripple bare the countermand that came too lag to see him buri\u00e8d god grant that some less noble and less loyal nearer in bloody thoughts and not in blood deserve not worse than wretched clarence did and yet go current from suspicion this is the fruits of rashness marked you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen looked pale when they did hear of clarence' death o they did urge it still unto the king god will revenge it come lords will you go to comfort edward with our company sister have comfort all of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star but none can help our harms by wailing them  madam my mother i do cry you mercy i did not see your grace humbly on my knee i crave your blessing amen and make me die a good old man that is the butt end of a mother's blessing i marvel that her grace did leave it out i hope the king made peace with all of us and the compact is firm and true in me then be it so and go we to determine who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow  madam and you my sister will you go to give your censures in this business my other self my council's consistory my oracle my prophet my dear cousin i as a child will go by thy direction toward ludlow then for we'll not stay behind welcome dear cousin my thoughts' sovereign the weary way hath made you melancholy sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years hath not yet dived into the world's deceit nor more can you distinguish of a man than of his outward show which god he knows seldom or never jumpeth with the heart those uncles which you want were dangerous your grace attended to their sugared words but looked not on the poison of their hearts god keep you from them and from such false friends my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you where it seems best unto your royal self if i may counsel you some day or two your highness shall repose you at the tower then where you please and shall be thought most fit for your best health and recreation so wise so young they say do never live long i say without characters fame lives long thus like the formal vice iniquity i moralize two meanings in one word short summers lightly have a forward spring how fares our cousin noble lord of york he hath my lord o my fair cousin i must not say so he may command me as my sovereign but you have power in me as in a kinsman my dagger little cousin with all my heart a greater gift than that i'll give my cousin ay gentle cousin were it light enough it is too heavy for your grace to wear what would you have my weapon little lord how my lord will 't please you pass along myself and my good cousin buckingham will to your mother to entreat of her to meet you at the tower and welcome you why what should you fear nor none that live i hope no doubt no doubt o 'tis a parlous boy bold quick ingenious forward capable he is all the mother's from the top to toe commend me to lord william tell him catesby his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries tomorrow are let blood at pomfret castle and bid my lord for joy of this good news give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep at crosby house there shall you find us both chop off his head something we will determine and look when i am king claim thou of me the earldom of hereford and all the movables whereof the king my brother was possessed and look to have it yielded with all kindness come let us sup betimes that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form my noble lords and cousins all good morrow i have been long a sleeper but i trust my absence doth neglect no great design which by my presence might have been concluded than my lord hastings no man might be bolder his lordship knows me well and loves me well  my lord of ely when i was last in holborn i saw good strawberries in your garden there i do beseech you send for some of them cousin of buckingham a word with you catesby hath sounded hastings in our business and finds the testy gentleman so hot that he will lose his head ere give consent his master's child as worshipfully he terms it shall lose the royalty of england's throne i pray you all tell me what they deserve that do conspire my death with devilish plots of damn\u00e8d witchcraft and that have prevailed upon my body with their hellish charms then be your eyes the witness of their evil look how i am bewitched behold mine arm is like a blasted sapling withered up and this is edward's wife that monstrous witch consorted with that harlot strumpet shore that by their witchcraft thus have mark\u00e8d me if thou protector of this damn\u00e8d strumpet talk'st thou to me of ifs thou art a traitor  off with his head now by saint paul i swear i will not dine until i see the same  lovell and ratcliffe look that it be done  the rest that love me rise and follow me come cousin canst thou quake and change thy color murder thy breath in middle of a word and then again begin and stop again as if thou were distraught and mad with terror he is and see he brings the mayor along look to the drawbridge there catesby o'erlook the walls look back defend thee here are enemies be patient they are friends ratcliffe and lovell so dear i loved the man that i must weep i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathed upon the earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts so smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted  i mean his conversation with shore's wife  he lived from all attainder of suspects what think you we are turks or infidels or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly in the villain's death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons' safety enforced us to this execution and to that end we wished your lordship here t' avoid the censures of the carping world go after after cousin buckingham the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post there at your meetest vantage of the time infer the bastardy of edward's children tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown meaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was term\u00e8d so moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretched unto their servants daughters wives even where his raging eye or savage heart without control lusted to make a prey nay for a need thus far come near my person tell them when that my mother went with child of that insatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by true computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appear\u00e8d in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father yet touch this sparingly as 'twere far off because my lord you know my mother lives if you thrive well bring them to baynard's castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well learn\u00e8d bishops go lovell with all speed to doctor shaa go thou to friar penker bid them both meet me within this hour at baynard's castle now will i go to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give order that no manner person have any time recourse unto the princes how now how now what say the citizens touched you the bastardy of edward's children and did they so what tongueless blocks were they would they not speak will not the mayor then and his brethren come i go an if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt we bring it to a happy issue my lord there needs no such apology i do beseech your grace to pardon me who earnest in the service of my god deferred the visitation of my friends but leaving this what is your grace's pleasure i do suspect i have done some offense that seems disgracious in the city's eye and that you come to reprehend my ignorance else wherefore breathe i in a christian land i cannot tell if to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think tongue tied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so seasoned with your faithful love to me then on the other side i checked my friends therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as the ripe revenue and due of birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects that i would rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapor of my glory smothered but god be thanked there is no need of me and much i need to help you were there need the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellowed by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign on him i lay that you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him alas why would you heap this care on me i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you o do not swear my lord of buckingham will you enforce me to a world of cares call them again i am not made of stones but penetrable to your kind entreaties albeit against my conscience and my soul cousin of buckingham and sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burden whe'er i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foul faced reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god doth know and you may partly see how far i am from the desire of this in saying so you shall but say the truth even when you please for you will have it so come let us to our holy work again  farewell my cousin farewell gentle friends stand all apart cousin of buckingham give me thy hand thus high by thy advice and thy assistance is king richard seated but shall we wear these glories for a day or shall they last and we rejoice in them ah buckingham now do i play the touch to try if thou be current gold indeed young edward lives think now what i would speak why buckingham i say i would be king ha am i king 'tis so but edward lives o bitter consequence that edward still should live true noble prince cousin thou wast not wont to be so dull shall i be plain i wish the bastards dead and i would have it suddenly performed what sayst thou now speak suddenly be brief tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezes say have i thy consent that they shall die i will converse with iron witted fools and unrespective boys none are for me that look into me with considerate eyes high reaching buckingham grows circumspect  boy know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold will tempt unto a close exploit of death what is his name i partly know the man go call him hither boy the deep revolving witty buckingham no more shall be the neighbor to my counsels hath he so long held out with me untired and stops he now for breath well be it so how now lord stanley what's the news come hither catesby rumor it abroad that anne my wife is very grievous sick i will take order for her keeping close inquire me out some mean poor gentleman whom i will marry straight to clarence' daughter the boy is foolish and i fear not him look how thou dream'st i say again give out that anne my queen is sick and like to die about it for it stands me much upon to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me i must be married to my brother's daughter or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass murder her brothers and then marry her  uncertain way of gain but i am in so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin tear falling pity dwells not in this eye is thy name tyrrel art thou indeed dar'st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine why then thou hast it two deep enemies foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers are they that i would have thee deal upon tyrrel i mean those bastards in the tower thou sing'st sweet music hark come hither tyrrel go by this token rise and lend thine ear there is no more but so say it is done and i will love thee and prefer thee for it well let that rest dorset is fled to richmond stanley he is your wife's son well look unto it stanley look to your wife if she convey letters to richmond you shall answer it i do remember me henry the sixth did prophesy that richmond should be king when richmond was a little peevish boy a king perhaps  how chance the prophet could not at that time have told me i being by that i should kill him richmond when last i was at exeter the mayor in courtesy showed me the castle and called it rougemont at which name i started because a bard of ireland told me once i should not live long after i saw richmond ay what's o'clock well but what's o'clock well let it strike because that like a jack thou keep'st the stroke betwixt thy begging and my meditation i am not in the giving vein today thou troublest me i am not in the vein kind tyrrel am i happy in thy news but did'st thou see them dead and buried gentle tyrrel come to me tyrrel soon at after supper when thou shalt tell the process of their death meantime but think how i may do thee good and be inheritor of thy desire farewell till then the son of clarence have i pent up close his daughter meanly have i matched in marriage the sons of edward sleep in abraham's bosom and anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight now for i know the breton richmond aims at young elizabeth my brother's daughter and by that knot looks proudly on the crown to her go i a jolly thriving wooer good or bad news that thou com'st in so bluntly ely with richmond troubles me

base newsmongers i may for some things true wherein my youth hath faulty wandered and irregular find pardon on my true submission i shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord be more myself do not think so you shall not find it so and god forgive them that so much have swayed your majesty's good thoughts away from me i will redeem all this on percy's head and in the closing of some glorious day be bold to tell you that i am your son when i will wear a garment all of blood and stain my favors in a bloody mask which washed away shall scour my shame with it and that shall be the day whene'er it lights that this same child of honor and renown this gallant hotspur this all prais\u00e8d knight and your unthought of harry chance to meet for every honor sitting on his helm would they were multitudes and on my head my shames redoubled for the time will come that i shall make this northern youth exchange his glorious deeds for my indignities percy is but my factor good my lord to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf and i will call him to so strict account that he shall render every glory up yea even the slightest worship of his time or i will tear the reckoning from his heart this in the name of god i promise here the which if he be pleased i shall perform i do beseech your majesty may salve the long grown wounds of my intemperance if not the end of life cancels all bands and i will die a hundred thousand deaths ere break the smallest parcel of this vow what say'st thou mistress quickly how doth thy husband i love him well he is an honest man what say'st thou jack what didst thou lose jack a trifle some eightpenny matter what he did not an otter sir john why an otter thou sayst true hostess and he slanders thee most grossly sirrah do i owe you a thousand pound i say 'tis copper darest thou be as good as thy word now and why not as the lion o if it should how would thy guts fall about thy knees but sirrah there's no room for faith truth nor honesty in this bosom of thine it is all filled up with guts and midriff charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket why thou whoreson impudent embossed rascal if there were anything in thy pocket but tavern reckonings memorandums of bawdy houses and one poor pennyworth of sugar candy to make thee long winded if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these i am a villain and yet you will stand to it you will not pocket up wrong art thou not ashamed it appears so by the story o my sweet beef i must still be good angel to thee the money is paid back again i am good friends with my father and may do anything i have procured thee jack a charge of foot bardolph go bear this letter to lord john of lancaster to my brother john this to my lord of westmoreland go peto to horse to horse for thou and i have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time jack meet me tomorrow in the temple hall at two o'clock in the afternoon there shalt thou know thy charge and there receive money and order for their furniture the land is burning percy stands on high and either we or they must lower lie how now blown jack how now quilt i think to steal cream indeed for thy theft hath already made thee butter but tell me jack whose fellows are these that come after i did never see such pitiful rascals no i'll be sworn unless you call three fingers in the ribs bare but sirrah make haste percy is already in the field the southern wind doth play the trumpet to his purposes and by his hollow whistling in the leaves foretells a tempest and a blust'ring day peace chewet peace in both your armies there is many a soul shall pay full dearly for this encounter if once they join in trial tell your nephew the prince of wales doth join with all the world in praise of henry percy by my hopes this present enterprise set off his head i do not think a braver gentleman more active valiant or more valiant young more daring or more bold is now alive to grace this latter age with noble deeds for my part i may speak it to my shame i have a truant been to chivalry and so i hear he doth account me too yet this before my father's majesty i am content that he shall take the odds of his great name and estimation and will to save the blood on either side try fortune with him in a single fight it will not be accepted on my life the douglas and the hotspur both together are confident against the world in arms nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship say thy prayers and farewell why thou owest god a death what stand'st thou idle here lend me thy sword many a nobleman lies stark and stiff under the hoofs of vaunting enemies whose deaths are yet unrevenged i prithee lend me thy sword he is indeed and living to kill thee i prithee lend me thy sword give it me what is it in the case what is it a time to jest and dally now i beseech your majesty make up lest your retirement do amaze your friends lead me my lord i do not need your help and god forbid a shallow scratch should drive the prince of wales from such a field as this where stained nobility lies trodden on and rebels' arms triumph in massacres by god thou hast deceived me lancaster i did not think thee lord of such a spirit before i loved thee as a brother john but now i do respect thee as my soul o this boy lends mettle to us all hold up thy head vile scot or thou art like never to hold it up again the spirits of valiant shirley stafford blunt are in my arms it is the prince of wales that threatens thee who never promiseth but he means to pay cheerly my lord how fares your grace sir nicholas gawsey hath for succor sent and so hath clifton i'll to clifton straight o god they did me too much injury that ever said i hearkened for your death if it were so i might have let alone the insulting hand of douglas over you which would have been as speedy in your end as all the poisonous potions in the world and saved the treacherous labor of your son thou speak'st as if i would deny my name why then i see a very valiant rebel of the name i am the prince of wales and think not percy to share with me in glory any more two stars keep not their motion in one sphere nor can one england brook a double reign of harry percy and the prince of wales i'll make it greater ere i part from thee and all the budding honors on thy crest i'll crop to make a garland for my head for worms brave percy fare thee well great heart ill weaved ambition how much art thou shrunk when that this body did contain a spirit a kingdom for it was too small a bound but now two paces of the vilest earth is room enough this earth that bears thee dead bears not alive so stout a gentleman if thou wert sensible of courtesy i should not make so dear a show of zeal but let my favors hide thy mangled face and even in thy behalf i'll thank myself for doing these fair rites of tenderness adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave but not remembered in thy epitaph what old acquaintance could not all this flesh keep in a little life poor jack farewell i could have better spared a better man o i should have a heavy miss of thee if i were much in love with vanity death hath not struck so fat a deer today though many dearer in this bloody fray emboweled will i see thee by and by till then in blood by noble percy lie come brother john full bravely hast thou fleshed thy maiden sword i did i saw him dead breathless and bleeding on the ground art thou alive or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight i prithee speak we will not trust our eyes without our ears thou art not what thou seem'st why percy i killed myself and saw thee dead this is the strangest fellow brother john  come bring your luggage nobly on your back for my part if a lie may do thee grace i'll gild it with the happiest terms i have the trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours come brother let us to the highest of the field to see what friends are living who are dead the noble scot lord douglas when he saw the fortune of the day quite turned from him the noble percy slain and all his men upon the foot of fear fled with the rest and falling from a hill he was so bruised that the pursuers took him at my tent the douglas is and i beseech your grace i may dispose of him then brother john of lancaster to you this honorable bounty shall belong go to the douglas and deliver him up to his pleasure ransomless and free his valors shown upon our crests today have taught us how to cherish such high deeds even in the bosom of our adversaries", "Mac_Macbeth": "so foul and fair a day i have not seen speak if you can

i'll bring you to him the labor we delight in physics pain this is the door he does he did appoint so 'twas a rough night what's the matter what is 't you say the life had i but died an hour before this chance i had lived a bless\u00e8d time for from this instant there's nothing serious in mortality all is but toys renown and grace is dead the wine of life is drawn and the mere lees is left this vault to brag of you are and do not know 't the spring the head the fountain of your blood is stopped the very source of it is stopped o yet i do repent me of my fury that i did kill them who can be wise amazed temp'rate and furious loyal and neutral in a moment no man th' expedition of my violent love outrun the pauser reason here lay duncan his silver skin laced with his golden blood and his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature for ruin's wasteful entrance there the murderers steeped in the colors of their trade their daggers unmannerly breeched with gore who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make 's love known so all let's briefly put on manly readiness and meet i' th' hall together here's our chief guest tonight we hold a solemn supper sir and i'll request your presence ride you this afternoon we should have else desired your good advice which still hath been both grave and prosperous in this day's council but we'll take tomorrow is 't far you ride fail not our feast we hear our bloody cousins are bestowed in england and in ireland not confessing their cruel parricide filling their hearers with strange invention but of that tomorrow when therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly hie you to horse adieu till you return at night goes fleance with you i wish your horses swift and sure of foot and so i do commend you to their backs farewell let every man be master of his time till seven at night to make society the sweeter welcome we will keep ourself till suppertime alone while then god be with you sirrah a word with you attend those men our pleasure bring them before us to be thus is nothing but to be safely thus our fears in banquo stick deep and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be feared 'tis much he dares and to that dauntless temper of his mind he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor to act in safety there is none but he whose being i do fear and under him my genius is rebuked as it is said mark antony's was by caesar he chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me and bade them speak to him then prophet like they hailed him father to a line of kings upon my head they placed a fruitless crown and put a barren scepter in my grip thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand no son of mine succeeding if 't be so for banquo's issue have i filed my mind for them the gracious duncan have i murdered put rancors in the vessel of my peace only for them and mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man to make them kings the seeds of banquo kings rather than so come fate into the list and champion me to th' utterance who's there now go to the door and stay there till we call was it not yesterday we spoke together well then now have you considered of my speeches know that it was he in the times past which held you so under fortune which you thought had been our innocent self this i made good to you in our last conference passed in probation with you how you were borne in hand how crossed the instruments who wrought with them and all things else that might to half a soul and to a notion crazed say thus did banquo i did so and went further which is now our point of second meeting do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go are you so gospeled to pray for this good man and for his issue whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave and beggared yours forever ay in the catalogue you go for men as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs shoughs water rugs and demi wolves are clept all by the name of dogs the valued file distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle the housekeeper the hunter every one according to the gift which bounteous nature hath in him closed whereby he does receive particular addition from the bill that writes them all alike and so of men now if you have a station in the file not i' th' worst rank of manhood say 't and i will put that business in your bosoms whose execution takes your enemy off grapples you to the heart and love of us who wear our health but sickly in his life which in his death were perfect both of you know banquo was your enemy so is he mine and in such bloody distance that every minute of his being thrusts against my near'st of life and though i could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it yet i must not for certain friends that are both his and mine whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall who i myself struck down and thence it is that i to your assistance do make love masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons your spirits shine through you within this hour at most i will advise you where to plant yourselves acquaint you with the perfect spy o' th' time the moment on 't for 't must be done tonight and something from the palace always thought that i require a clearness and with him to leave no rubs nor botches in the work fleance his son that keeps him company whose absence is no less material to me than is his father's must embrace the fate of that dark hour resolve yourselves apart i'll come to you anon i'll call upon you straight abide within it is concluded banquo thy soul's flight if it find heaven must find it out tonight we have scorched the snake not killed it she'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth but let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly better be with the dead whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy duncan is in his grave after life's fitful fever he sleeps well treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison malice domestic foreign levy nothing can touch him further so shall i love and so i pray be you let your remembrance apply to banquo present him eminence both with eye and tongue unsafe the while that we must lave our honors in these flattering streams and make our faces vizards to our hearts disguising what they are o full of scorpions is my mind dear wife thou know'st that banquo and his fleance lives there's comfort yet they are assailable then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown his cloistered flight ere to black hecate's summons the shard born beetle with his drowsy hums hath rung night's yawning peal there shall be done a deed of dreadful note be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck till thou applaud the deed come seeling night scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day and with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale light thickens and the crow makes wing to th' rooky wood good things of day begin to droop and drowse whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse  thou marvel'st at my words but hold thee still things bad begun make strong themselves by ill so prithee go with me you know your own degrees sit down at first and last the hearty welcome ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host our hostess keeps her state but in best time we will require her welcome see they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks both sides are even here i'll sit i' th' midst be large in mirth anon we'll drink a measure the table round there's blood upon thy face 'tis better thee without than he within is he dispatched thou art the best o' th' cutthroats yet he's good that did the like for fleance if thou didst it thou art the nonpareil then comes my fit again i had else been perfect whole as the marble founded as the rock as broad and general as the casing air but now i am cabined cribbed confined bound in to saucy doubts and fears but banquo's safe thanks for that there the grown serpent lies the worm that's fled hath nature that in time will venom breed no teeth for th' present get thee gone tomorrow we'll hear ourselves again sweet remembrancer  now good digestion wait on appetite and health on both here had we now our country's honor roofed were the graced person of our banquo present who may i rather challenge for unkindness than pity for mischance the table's full where which of you have done this thou canst not say i did it never shake thy gory locks at me ay and a bold one that dare look on that which might appall the devil prithee see there behold look lo how say you why what care i if thou canst nod speak too  if charnel houses and our graves must send those that we bury back our monuments shall be the maws of kites if i stand here i saw him blood hath been shed ere now i' th' olden time ere humane statute purged the gentle weal ay and since too murders have been performed too terrible for the ear the time has been that when the brains were out the man would die and there an end but now they rise again with twenty mortal murders on their crowns and push us from our stools this is more strange than such a murder is i do forget  do not muse at me my most worthy friends i have a strange infirmity which is nothing to those that know me come love and health to all then i'll sit down give me some wine fill full i drink to th' general joy o' th' whole table and to our dear friend banquo whom we miss would he were here to all and him we thirst and all to all avaunt and quit my sight let the earth hide thee thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with what man dare i dare approach thou like the rugged russian bear the armed rhinoceros or th' hyrcan tiger take any shape but that and my firm nerves shall never tremble or be alive again and dare me to the desert with thy sword if trembling i inhabit then protest me the baby of a girl hence horrible shadow unreal mock'ry hence why so being gone i am a man again pray you sit still can such things be and overcome us like a summer's cloud without our special wonder you make me strange even to the disposition that i owe when now i think you can behold such sights and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks when mine is blanched with fear it will have blood they say blood will have blood stones have been known to move and trees to speak augurs and understood relations have by maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth the secret'st man of blood what is the night how say'st thou that macduff denies his person at our great bidding i hear it by the way but i will send there's not a one of them but in his house i keep a servant fee'd i will tomorrow and betimes i will to the we\u00efrd sisters more shall they speak for now i am bent to know by the worst means the worst for mine own good all causes shall give way i am in blood stepped in so far that should i wade no more

wants hard use we are yet but young in deed how now you secret black and midnight hags what is 't you do i conjure you by that which you profess howe'er you come to know it answer me though you untie the winds and let them fight against the churches though the yeasty waves confound and swallow navigation up though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down though castles topple on their warders' heads though palaces and pyramids do slope their heads to their foundations though the treasure of nature's germens tumble all together even till destruction sicken answer me to what i ask you call 'em let me see 'em tell me thou unknown power  whate'er thou art for thy good caution thanks thou hast harped my fear aright but one word more  had i three ears i'd hear thee then live macduff what need i fear of thee but yet i'll make assurance double sure and take a bond of fate thou shalt not live that i may tell pale hearted fear it lies and sleep in spite of thunder what is this that rises like the issue of a king and wears upon his baby brow the round and top of sovereignty that will never be who can impress the forest bid the tree unfix his earthbound root sweet bodements good rebellious dead rise never till the wood of birnam rise and our high placed macbeth shall live the lease of nature pay his breath to time and mortal custom yet my heart throbs to know one thing tell me if your art can tell so much shall banquo's issue ever reign in this kingdom i will be satisfied deny me this and an eternal curse fall on you let me know why sinks that cauldron and what noise is this thou art too like the spirit of banquo down thy crown does sear mine eyeballs and thy hair thou other gold bound brow is like the first a third is like the former filthy hags why do you show me

that twofold balls and treble scepters carry horrible sight now i see 'tis true for the blood boltered banquo smiles upon me and points at them for his what is this so where are they gone let this pernicious hour stand aye accurs\u00e8d in the calendar  come in without there saw you the we\u00efrd sisters came they not by you infected be the air whereon they ride and damned all those that trust

banners on the outward walls the cry is still they come our castle's strength will laugh a siege to scorn here let them lie till famine and the ague eat them up were they not forced with those that should be ours we might have met them dareful beard to beard and beat them backward home what is that noise i have almost forgot the taste of fears the time has been my senses would have cooled to hear a night shriek and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in 't i have supped full with horrors direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts cannot once start me wherefore was that cry she should have died hereafter there would have been a time for such a word tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death out out brief candle life's but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing thou com'st to use thy tongue thy story quickly well say sir liar and slave if thou speak'st false upon the next tree shall thou hang alive till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth i care not if thou dost for me as much  i pull in resolution and begin to doubt th' equivocation of the fiend that lies like

but swords i smile at weapons laugh to scorn brandished by man that's of a woman born why should i play the roman fool and die on mine own sword whiles i see lives the gashes do better upon them of all men else i have avoided thee but get thee back my soul is too much charged with blood of thine already thou losest labor as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests i bear a charm\u00e8d life which must not yield to one of woman born accurs\u00e8d be that tongue that tells me so for it hath cowed my better part of man and be these juggling fiends no more believed that palter with us in a double sense that keep the word of promise to our ear and break it to our hope i'll not fight with thee i will not yield to kiss the ground before young malcolm's feet and to be baited with the rabble's curse though birnam wood be come to dunsinane and thou opposed being of no woman born yet i will try the last before my

speech and discourse since i am put to know that your own science exceeds in that the lists of all advice my strength can give you then no more remains but that to your sufficiency as your worth is able and let them work the nature of our people our city's institutions and the terms for common justice you're as pregnant in as art and practice hath enrich\u00e8d any that we remember there is our commission from which we would not have you warp call hither i say bid come before us angelo what figure of us think you he will bear for you must know we have with special soul elected him our absence to supply lent him our terror dressed him with our love and given his deputation all the organs of our own power what think you of it look where he comes angelo there is a kind of character in thy life that to th' observer doth thy history fully unfold thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues they on thee heaven doth with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us 'twere all alike as if we had them not spirits are not finely touched but to fine issues nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines herself the glory of a creditor both thanks and use but i do bend my speech to one that can my part in him advertise hold therefore angelo in our remove be thou at full ourself mortality and mercy in vienna live in thy tongue and heart old escalus though first in question is thy secondary take thy commission no more evasion we have with a leavened and prepar\u00e8d choice proceeded to you therefore take your honors our haste from hence is of so quick condition that it prefers itself and leaves unquestioned matters of needful value we shall write to you as time and our concernings shall importune how it goes with us and do look to know what doth befall you here so fare you well to th' hopeful execution do i leave you of your commissions my haste may not admit it nor need you on mine honor have to do with any scruple your scope is as mine own so to enforce or qualify the laws as to your soul seems good give me your hand i'll privily away i love the people but do not like to stage me to their eyes though it do well i do not relish well their loud applause and aves vehement nor do i think the man of safe discretion that does affect it once more fare you well i thank you fare you well no holy father throw away that thought believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee to give me secret harbor hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth my holy sir none better knows than you how i have ever loved the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth and cost witless bravery keeps i have delivered to lord angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence my absolute power and place here in vienna and he supposes me traveled to poland for so i have strewed it in the common ear and so it is received now pious sir you will demand of me why i do this we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds which for this fourteen years we have let slip even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch only to stick it in their children's sight for terror not to use in time the rod more mocked than feared so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum i do fear too dreadful sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope 'twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment therefore indeed my father i have on angelo imposed the office who may in th' ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander and to behold his sway i will as 'twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people therefore i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear like a true friar more reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you only this one lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone hence shall we see if power change purpose what our seemers be hail to you provost so i think you are bound by my charity and my blest order i come to visit the afflicted spirits here in the prison do me the common right to let me see them and to make me know the nature of their crimes that i may minister to them accordingly when must he die repent you fair one of the sin you carry i'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience and try your penitence if it be sound or hollowly put on love you the man that wronged you so then it seems your most offenseful act was mutually committed then was your sin of heavier kind than his 'tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven showing we would not spare heaven as we love it but as we stand in fear  there rest your partner as i hear must die tomorrow and i am going with instruction to him grace go with you benedicite so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo be absolute for death either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep a breath thou art servile to all the skyey influences that doth this habitation where thou keep'st hourly afflict merely thou art death's fool for him thou labor'st by thy flight to shun and yet runn'st toward him still thou art not noble for all th' accommodations that thou bear'st are nursed by baseness thou 'rt by no means valiant for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provok'st yet grossly fear'st thy death which is no more thou art not thyself for thou exists on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou striv'st to get and what thou hast forget'st thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon if thou art rich thou 'rt poor for like an ass whose back with ingots bows thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey and death unloads thee friend hast thou none for thine own bowels which do call thee sire the mere effusion of thy proper loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an after dinner's sleep dreaming on both for all thy bless\u00e8d youth becomes as ag\u00e8d and doth beg the alms of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant what's yet in this that bears the name of life yet in this life lie hid more thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes these odds all even dear sir ere long i'll visit you again provost a word with you bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed vouchsafe a word young sister but one word might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction i would require is likewise your own benefit son i have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practice his judgment with the disposition of natures she having the truth of honor in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make ready hold you there farewell provost a word with you that now you are come you will be gone leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair the assault that angelo hath made to you fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo how will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have you not heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea she should this angelo have married was affianced to her oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was wracked at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriage dowry with both her combinate husband this well seeming angelo left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonor in few bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonor in doing it this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience this being granted in course and now follows all we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honor untainted the poor mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt if you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof what think you of it it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction i will presently to saint luke's there at the moated grange resides this dejected mariana at that place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that it may be quickly o heavens what stuff is here and you good brother father what offense hath this man made you sir fie sirrah a bawd a wicked bawd the evil that thou causest to be done that is thy means to live do thou but think what 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back from such a filthy vice say to thyself from their abominable and beastly touches i drink i eat array myself and live canst thou believe thy living is a life so stinkingly depending go mend go mend nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin thou wilt prove his take him to prison officer correction and instruction must both work ere this rude beast will profit that we were all as some would seem to be from our faults as faults from seeming free still thus and thus still worse and you i know none can you tell me of any i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well he does well in 't it is too general a vice and severity must cure it how should he be made then you are pleasant sir and speak apace i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way 'tis not possible you do him wrong surely what i prithee might be the cause wise why no question but he was either this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own bringings forth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier therefore you speak unskillfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call upon you and i pray you your name he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you o you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i can do you little harm you'll forswear this again why should he die sir no might nor greatness in mortality can censure scape back wounding calumny the whitest virtue strikes what king so strong can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue but who comes here bliss and goodness on you not of this country though my chance is now to use it for my time i am a brother of gracious order late come from the see in special business from his holiness none but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accursed much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this news is old enough yet it is every day's news i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke what pleasure was he given to he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which i by my good leisure have discredited to him and now is he resolved to die if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced himself peace be with you he who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severe pattern in himself to know grace to stand and virtue go more nor less to others paying than by self offenses weighing shame to him whose cruel striking kills for faults of his own liking twice treble shame on angelo to weed my vice and let his grow o what may man within him hide though angel on the outward side how may likeness made in crimes making practice on the times to draw with idle spiders' strings most ponderous and substantial things craft against vice i must apply with angelo tonight shall lie his old betroth\u00e8d but despis\u00e8d so disguise shall by th' disguis\u00e8d pay with falsehood false exacting and perform an old contracting 'tis good though music oft hath such a charm to make bad good and good provoke to harm i pray you tell me hath anybody inquired for me here today much upon this time have i promised here to meet i do constantly believe you the time is come even now i shall crave your forbearance a little maybe i will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself very well met and welcome what is the news from this good deputy but shall you on your knowledge find this way are there no other tokens between you 'greed concerning her observance 'tis well borne up i have not yet made known to mariana a word of this what ho within come forth i pray you be acquainted with this maid she comes to do you good do you persuade yourself that i respect you take then this your companion by the hand who hath a story ready for your ear i shall attend your leisure but make haste the vaporous night approaches o place and greatness millions of false eyes are stuck upon thee volumes of report run with these false and most contrarious quest upon thy doings thousand escapes of wit make thee the father of their idle dream and rack thee in their fancies welcome how agreed it is not my consent but my entreaty too nor gentle daughter fear you not at all he is your husband on a precontract to bring you thus together 'tis no sin sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit come let us go our corn's to reap for yet our tithe's to sow the best and wholesom'st spirits of the night envelop you good provost who called here of late not isabel they will then ere 't be long there's some in hope not so not so his life is paralleled even with the stroke and line of his great justice he doth with holy abstinence subdue that in himself which he spurs on his power to qualify in others were he mealed with that which he corrects then were he tyrannous but this being so he's just now are they come this is a gentle provost seldom when the steel\u00e8d jailer is the friend of men how now what noise that spirit's possessed with haste that wounds th' unsisting postern with these strokes have you no countermand for claudio yet but he must die tomorrow as near the dawning provost as it is you shall hear more ere morning and here comes claudio's pardon this is his pardon purchased by such sin for which the pardoner himself is in hence hath offense his quick celerity when it is borne in high authority when vice makes mercy mercy's so extended that for the fault's love is th' offender friended now sir what news pray you let's hear what is that barnardine who is to be executed in th' afternoon how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him i have heard it was ever his manner to do so it is now apparent hath he borne himself penitently in prison how seems he to be touched he wants advice more of him anon there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him to make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four days' respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy in the delaying death by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions may be your guide let this barnardine be this morning executed and his head borne to angelo o death's a great disguiser and you may add to it shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common if anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against it with my life were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy you will think you have made no offense if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke you know the character i doubt not and the signet is not strange to you the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon overread it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenor perchance of the duke's death perchance entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ look th' unfolding star calls up the shepherd put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known call your executioner and off with barnardine's head i will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place yet you are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you come away it is almost clear dawn sir induced by my charity and hearing how hastily you are to depart i am come to advise you comfort you and pray with you o sir you must and therefore i beseech you look forward on the journey you shall go but hear you  unfit to live or die o gravel heart after him fellows bring him to the block a creature unprepared unmeet for death and to transport him in the mind he is were damnable o 'tis an accident that heaven provides dispatch it presently the hour draws on prefixed by angelo see this be done and sent according to command whiles i persuade this rude wretch willingly to die let this be done put them in secret holds both barnardine and claudio ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting to yonder generation you shall find your safety manifested quick dispatch and send the head to angelo now will i write letters to angelo  the provost he shall bear them whose contents shall witness to him i am near at home and that by great injunctions i am bound to enter publicly him i'll desire to meet me at the consecrated fount a league below the city and from thence by cold gradation and well balanced form we shall proceed with angelo convenient is it make a swift return for i would commune with you of such things that want no ear but yours the tongue of isabel she's come to know if yet her brother's pardon be come hither but i will keep her ignorant of her good to make her heavenly comforts of despair when it is least expected

many hath he killed for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffing well we are all mortal alas he gets nothing by that in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature who is his companion now he hath every month a new sworn brother very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block no an he were i would burn my study but i pray you who is his companion is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil o lord he will hang upon

less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man i am not for him therefore i will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd and lead his apes into hell no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say get you to heaven beatrice get you to heaven here's no place for you maids so deliver i up

you not tell me who told you so nor will you not tell me who you are that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of the hundred merry tales well this was signior benedick that said so i am sure you know him well enough did he never make you laugh why he is the prince's jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the

the thing i know not it were as possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as you but believe me not and yet i lie not i confess nothing nor i deny nothing i am sorry for my cousin do not swear and eat it will you not eat your word why then god forgive me you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to protest i loved you i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest kill claudio you kill me to deny it farewell i am gone though i am here there is no love in you nay i pray you let me go in faith i will go you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonored my kinswoman o that i were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancor o god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the marketplace talk with a man out at a window a proper saying sweet hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone princes and counties surely a princely testimony a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into curtsies valor into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears it i cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving use it for my love some other way than swearing by it yea as sure as i have a thought or a soul yea signior and depart when you bid me then is spoken fare you well now and yet ere i go let me go with that i came which is with knowing what hath passed between you and claudio foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore i will depart unkissed for them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me in spite of your heart i think alas poor heart if you spite it for my sake i will spite it for yours for i will never love that which my friend hates it appears not in this confession there's not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself and how long is that think you very ill very ill too will you go hear this news signior i answer to that name what is your will why no no more than reason do not you love me why then my cousin margaret and ursula are much deceived for they did swear you did they swore that you were well

acquisition worthily purchased take my daughter but if thou dost break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite be ministered no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall to make this contract grow but barren hate sour eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew the union of your bed with weeds so loathly that you shall hate it both therefore take heed as hymen's lamps shall light you fairly spoke sit then and talk with her she is thine own what ariel my industrious servant ariel thou and thy meaner fellows your last service did worthily perform and i

son in a moved sort as if you were dismayed be cheerful sir our revels now are ended these our actors as i foretold you were all spirits and are melted into air into thin air and like the baseless fabric of this vision the cloud capped towers the gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself yea all which it inherit shall dissolve and like this insubstantial pageant faded leave not a rack behind we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep sir i am vexed bear with my weakness my old brain is troubled be not disturbed with my infirmity if you be pleased retire into my cell and there repose a turn or two i'll walk to still my beating mind come with a thought i thank thee ariel come spirit we must prepare to meet with caliban say again where didst thou leave these varlets this was well done my bird thy shape invisible retain thou still the trumpery in my house go bring it hither for stale to catch these thieves a devil a born devil

freedom for a little follow and do me service now does my project gather to a head my charms crack not my spirits obey and time goes upright with his carriage how's the day i did say so when first i raised the tempest say my spirit how fares the king and 's followers dost thou think so spirit and mine shall hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling of their afflictions and shall not myself one of their kind that relish all as sharply passion as they be kindlier moved than thou art though with their high wrongs i am struck to th' quick yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury do i take part the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent the sole drift of my purpose doth extend not a frown further go release them ariel my charms i'll break their senses i'll restore and they shall be themselves you elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves and you that on the sands with printless foot do chase the ebbing neptune and do fly him when he comes back you demi puppets that by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime is to make midnight mushrumps that rejoice to hear the solemn curfew by whose aid weak masters though you be i have bedimmed the noontide sun called forth the mutinous winds and 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder have i given fire and rifted jove's stout oak with his own bolt the strong based promontory have i made shake and by the spurs plucked up the pine and cedar graves at my command have waked their sleepers oped and let 'em forth by my so potent art but this rough magic i here abjure and when i have required some heavenly music which even now i do to work mine end upon their senses that this airy charm is for i'll break my staff bury it certain fathoms in the earth and deeper than did ever plummet sound i'll drown my book a solemn air and the best comforter to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains now useless boiled within thy skull there stand for you are spell stopped  holy gonzalo honorable man mine eyes e'en sociable to the show of thine fall fellowly drops the charm dissolves apace and as the morning steals upon the night melting the darkness so their rising senses begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle their clearer reason o good gonzalo my true preserver and a loyal sir to him thou follow'st i will pay thy graces home both in word and deed most cruelly didst thou alonso use me and my daughter thy brother was a furtherer in the act  thou art pinched for 't now sebastian flesh and blood you brother mine that entertained ambition expelled remorse and nature whom with sebastian whose inward pinches therefore are most strong would here have killed your king i do forgive thee unnatural though thou art their understanding begins to swell and the approaching tide will shortly fill the reasonable shore that now lies foul and muddy not one of them that yet looks on me or would know me ariel fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell i will discase me and myself present as i was sometime milan quickly spirit thou shalt ere long be free why that's my dainty ariel i shall miss thee but yet thou shalt have freedom so so so to the king's ship invisible as thou art there shalt thou find the mariners asleep under the hatches the master and the boatswain being awake enforce them to this place and presently i prithee behold sir king the wrong\u00e8d duke of milan prospero for more assurance that a living prince does now speak to thee i embrace thy body and to thee and thy company i bid a hearty welcome first noble friend let me embrace thine age whose honor cannot be measured or confined you do yet taste some subtleties o' th' isle that will not let you believe things certain welcome my friends all but you my brace of lords were i so minded i here could pluck his highness' frown upon you and justify you traitors at this time i will tell no tales no for you most wicked sir whom to call brother would even infect my mouth i do forgive thy rankest fault all of them and require my dukedom of thee which perforce i know thou must restore i am woe for 't sir i rather think you have not sought her help of whose soft grace for the like loss i have her sovereign aid and rest myself content as great to me as late and supportable to make the dear loss have i means much weaker than you may call to comfort you for i have lost my daughter in this last tempest i perceive these lords at this encounter do so much admire that they devour their reason and scarce think their eyes do offices of truth their words are natural breath but howsoe'er you have been justled from your senses know for certain that i am prospero and that very duke which was thrust forth of milan who most strangely upon this shore where you were wracked was landed to be the lord on 't no more yet of this for 'tis a chronicle of day by day not a relation for a breakfast nor befitting this first meeting welcome sir this cell's my court here have i few attendants and subjects none abroad pray you look in my dukedom since you have given me again i will requite you with as good a thing at least bring forth a wonder to content you as much as me my dukedom 'tis new to thee there sir stop let us not burden our remembrances with a heaviness that's gone my tricksy spirit bravely my diligence thou shalt be free sir my liege do not infest your mind with beating on the strangeness of this business at picked leisure which shall be shortly single i'll resolve you which to you shall seem probable of every these happened accidents till when be cheerful and think of each thing well come hither spirit set caliban and his companions free untie the spell how fares my gracious sir there are yet missing of your company some few odd lads that you remember not mark but the badges of these men my lords then say if they be true this misshapen knave his mother was a witch and one so strong that could control the moon make flows and ebbs and deal in her command without her power these three have robbed me and this demi devil for he's a bastard one had plotted with them to take my life two of these fellows you must know and own this thing of darkness i acknowledge mine you'd be king o' the isle sirrah he is as disproportioned in his manners as in his shape go sirrah to my cell take with you your companions as you look to have my pardon trim it handsomely go to away sir i invite your highness and your train to my poor cell where you shall take your rest for this one night which part of it i'll waste with such discourse as i not doubt shall make it go quick away the story of my life and the particular accidents gone by since i came to this isle and in the morn i'll bring you to your ship and so to naples where i have hope to see the nuptial of these our dear belov\u00e8d solemnized and thence retire me to my milan where every third thought shall be my grave i'll deliver all and promise you calm seas auspicious gales and sail so expeditious that shall catch your royal fleet far off my ariel chick that is thy charge then to the elements be free and fare thou well please you draw near now my charms are all o'erthrown and what strength i have 's mine own which is most faint now 'tis true i must be here confined by you or sent to naples let me not since i have my dukedom got and pardoned the deceiver dwell in this bare island by your spell but release me from my bands with the help of your good hands gentle breath of yours my sails must fill or else my project fails which was to please now i want spirits to enforce art to enchant and my ending is despair unless i be relieved by prayer which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all faults as you from crimes would pardoned be let your indulgence set me free", "Oth_Clown": "why masters have your instruments been in naples that they speak i' th' nose thus are these i pray you wind instruments o thereby hangs a tail marry sir by many a wind instrument that i know but masters here's money for you and the general so likes your music that he desires you for love's sake to make no more noise with it if you have any music that may not be heard to 't again but as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care then put up your pipes in your bag for i'll away go vanish into air away no i hear not your honest friend i hear you she is stirring sir if she will stir hither i shall seem to notify unto her i dare not say he lies anywhere he's a soldier and for me to say a soldier lies 'tis stabbing to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat i will catechize the world for him that is make questions and by them answer to do this is within the compass of man's wit and therefore i will attempt the doing it", "TGV_Proteus": "wilt thou be gone sweet valentine adieu think on thy proteus when thou haply seest some rare noteworthy object in thy travel wish me partaker in thy happiness when thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger if ever danger do environ thee commend thy grievance to my holy prayers for i will be thy beadsman valentine upon some book i love i'll pray for thee that's a deep story of a deeper love for he was more than over shoes in love over the boots nay give me not the boots what so by your circumstance you call me fool 'tis love you cavil at i am not love yet writers say as in the sweetest bud the eating canker dwells so eating love inhabits in the finest wits of all and thither will i bring thee valentine all happiness bechance to thee in milan he after honor hunts i after love he leaves his friends to dignify them more i leave myself my friends and all for love thou julia thou hast metamorphosed me made me neglect my studies lose my time war with good counsel set the world at nought made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought but now he parted hence to embark for milan indeed a sheep doth very often stray an if the shepherd be awhile away i do a silly answer and fitting well a sheep true and thy master a shepherd it shall go hard but i'll prove it by another the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep but dost thou hear gav'st thou my letter to julia here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons nay in that you are astray 'twere best pound you you mistake i mean the pound a pinfold but what said she nod ay why that's noddy and that set together is noddy no no you shall have it for bearing the letter why sir how do you bear with me beshrew me but you have a quick wit come come open the matter in brief what said she well sir here is for your pains what said she why couldst thou perceive so much from her what said she nothing go go begone to save your ship from wrack which cannot perish having thee aboard being destined to a drier death on shore i must go send some better messenger i fear my julia would not deign my lines receiving them from such a worthless post sweet love sweet lines sweet life here is her hand the agent of her heart here is her oath for love her honor's pawn o that our fathers would applaud our loves to seal our happiness with their consents o heavenly julia may 't please your lordship 'tis a word or two of commendations sent from valentine delivered by a friend that came from him there is no news my lord but that he writes how happily he lives how well beloved and daily grac\u00e8d by the emperor wishing me with him partner of his fortune as one relying on your lordship's will and not depending on his friendly wish my lord i cannot be so soon provided please you deliberate a day or two thus have i shunned the fire for fear of burning and drenched me in the sea where i am drowned i feared to show my father julia's letter lest he should take exceptions to my love and with the vantage of mine own excuse hath he excepted most against my love o how this spring of love resembleth the uncertain glory of an april day which now shows all the beauty of the sun and by and by a cloud takes all away why this it is my heart accords thereto and yet a thousand times it answers no have patience gentle julia when possibly i can i will return why then we'll make exchange here take you this here is my hand for my true constancy and when that hour o'erslips me in the day wherein i sigh not julia for thy sake the next ensuing hour some foul mischance torment me for my love's forgetfulness my father stays my coming answer not the tide is now nay not thy tide of tears that tide will stay me longer than i should julia farewell what gone without a word ay so true love should do it cannot speak for truth hath better deeds than words to grace it go i come i come alas this parting strikes poor lovers dumb not so sweet lady but too mean a servant to have a look of such a worthy mistress my duty will i boast of nothing else i'll die on him that says so but yourself that you are worthless we'll both attend upon your ladyship your friends are well and have them much commended i left them all in health my tales of love were wont to weary you i know you joy not in a love discourse enough i read your fortune in your eye was this the idol that you worship so no but she is an earthly paragon i will not flatter her when i was sick you gave me bitter pills and i must minister the like to you except my mistress have i not reason to prefer mine own why valentine what braggartism is this then let her alone but she loves you go on before i shall inquire you forth i must unto the road to disembark some necessaries that i needs must use and then i'll presently attend you i will even as one heat another heat expels or as one nail by strength drives out another so the remembrance of my former love is by a newer object quite forgotten is it mine eye or valentine's praise her true perfection or my false transgression that makes me reasonless to reason thus she is fair and so is julia that i love  that i did love for now my love is thawed which like a waxen image 'gainst a fire bears no impression of the thing it was methinks my zeal to valentine is cold and that i love him not as i was wont o but i love his lady too too much and that's the reason i love him so little how shall i dote on her with more advice that thus without advice begin to love her 'tis but her picture i have yet beheld and that hath dazzled my reason's light but when i look on her perfections there is no reason but i shall be blind if i can check my erring love i will if not to compass her i'll use my skill to leave my julia shall i be forsworn to love fair sylvia shall i be forsworn to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn and ev'n that power which gave me first my oath provokes me to this threefold perjury love bade me swear and love bids me forswear o sweet suggesting love if thou hast sinned teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it at first i did adore a twinkling star but now i worship a celestial sun unheedful vows may heedfully be broken and he wants wit that wants resolv\u00e8d will to learn his wit t' exchange the bad for better fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferred with twenty thousand soul confirming oaths i cannot leave to love and yet i do but there i leave to love where i should love julia i lose and valentine i lose if i keep them i needs must lose myself if i lose them thus find i by their loss for valentine myself for julia sylvia i to myself am dearer than a friend for love is still most precious in itself and sylvia witness heaven that made her fair  shows julia but a swarthy ethiope i will forget that julia is alive rememb'ring that my love to her is dead and valentine i'll hold an enemy aiming at sylvia as a sweeter friend i cannot now prove constant to myself without some treachery used to valentine this night he meaneth with a corded ladder to climb celestial sylvia's chamber window myself in counsel his competitor now presently i'll give her father notice of their disguising and pretended flight who all enraged will banish valentine for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter but valentine being gone i'll quickly cross by some sly trick blunt thurio's dull proceeding love lend me wings to make my purpose swift as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift my gracious lord that which i would discover the law of friendship bids me to conceal but when i call to mind your gracious favors done to me undeserving as i am my duty pricks me on to utter that which else no worldly good should draw from me know worthy prince sir valentine my friend this night intends to steal away your daughter myself am one made privy to the plot i know you have determined to bestow her on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates and should she thus be stol'n away from you it would be much vexation to your age thus for my duty's sake i rather chose to cross my friend in his intended drift than by concealing it heap on your head a pack of sorrows which would press you down being unprevented to your timeless grave know noble lord they have devised a mean how he her chamber window will ascend and with a corded ladder fetch her down for which the youthful lover now is gone and this way comes he with it presently where if it please you you may intercept him but good my lord do it so cunningly that my discovery be not aim\u00e8d at for love of you not hate unto my friend hath made me publisher of this pretense adieu my lord sir valentine is coming run boy run run and seek him out what seest thou valentine who then his spirit what then who wouldst thou strike villain forbear sirrah i say forbear friend valentine a word then in dumb silence will i bury mine for they are harsh untunable and bad no valentine no valentine that thou art banish\u00e8d o that's the news  from hence from sylvia and from me thy friend ay ay and she hath offered to the doom  which unreversed stands in effectual force  a sea of melting pearl which some call tears those at her father's churlish feet she tendered with them upon her knees her humble self wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them as if but now they wax\u00e8d pale for woe but neither bended knees pure hands held up sad sighs deep groans nor silver shedding tears could penetrate her uncompassionate sire but valentine if he be ta'en must die besides her intercession chafed him so when she for thy repeal was suppliant that to close prison he commanded her with many bitter threats of biding there cease to lament for that thou canst not help and study help for that which thou lament'st time is the nurse and breeder of all good here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love besides thy staying will abridge thy life hope is a lover's staff walk hence with that and manage it against despairing thoughts thy letters may be here though thou art hence which being writ to me shall be delivered even in the milk white bosom of thy love the time now serves not to expostulate come i'll convey thee through the city gate and ere i part with thee confer at large of all that may concern thy love affairs as thou lov'st sylvia though not for thyself regard thy danger and along with me go sirrah find him out come valentine gone my good lord a little time my lord will kill that grief longer than i prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace i do my lord she did my lord when valentine was here the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood cowardice and poor descent three things that women highly hold in hate ay if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend and that my lord i shall be loath to do 'tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend you have prevailed my lord if i can do it by aught that i can speak in his dispraise she shall not long continue love to him but say this weed her love from valentine it follows not that she will love sir thurio as much as i can do i will effect  but you sir thurio are not sharp enough you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets whose compos\u00e8d rhymes should be full fraught with serviceable vows say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart write till your ink be dry and with your tears moist it again and frame some feeling line that may discover such integrity for orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews whose golden touch could soften steel and stones make tigers tame and huge leviathans forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands after your dire lamenting elegies visit by night your lady's chamber window with some sweet consort to their instruments tune a deploring dump the night's dead silence will well become such sweet complaining grievance this or else nothing will inherit her we'll wait upon your grace till after supper and afterward determine our proceedings already have i been false to valentine and now i must be as unjust to thurio under the color of commending him i have access my own love to prefer but sylvia is too fair too true too holy to be corrupted with my worthless gifts when i protest true loyalty to her she twits me with my falsehood to my friend when to her beauty i commend my vows she bids me think how i have been forsworn in breaking faith with julia whom i loved and notwithstanding all her sudden quips the least whereof would quell a lover's hope yet spaniel like the more she spurns my love the more it grows and fawneth on her still but here comes thurio now must we to her window and give some evening music to her ear ay gentle thurio for you know that love will creep in service where it cannot go sir but i do or else i would be hence ay sylvia for your sake who is sylvia what is she that all our swains commend her holy fair and wise is she the heaven such grace did lend her that she might admir\u00e8d be is she kind as she is fair for beauty lives with kindness love doth to her eyes repair to help him of his blindness and being helped inhabits there then to sylvia let us sing that sylvia is excelling she excels each mortal thing upon the dull earth dwelling to her let us garlands bring sir thurio fear not you i will so plead that you shall say my cunning drift excels at saint gregory's well madam good even to your ladyship one lady if you knew his pure heart's truth you would quickly learn to know him by his voice sir proteus gentle lady and your servant that i may compass yours i grant sweet love that i did love a lady but she is dead i likewise hear that valentine is dead sweet lady let me rake it from the earth madam if your heart be so obdurate vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love the picture that is hanging in your chamber to that i'll speak to that i'll sigh and weep for since the substance of your perfect self is else devoted i am but a shadow and to your shadow will i make true love as wretches have o'ernight that wait for execution in the morn sebastian is thy name i like thee well and will employ thee in some service presently i hope thou wilt how now you whoreson peasant where have you been these two days loitering and what says she to my little jewel but she received my dog what didst thou offer her this from me go get thee hence and find my dog again or ne'er return again into my sight away i say stayest thou to vex me here a slave that still an end turns me to shame sebastian i have entertain\u00e8d thee partly that i have need of such a youth that can with some discretion do my business  for 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout  but chiefly for thy face and thy behavior which if my augury deceive me not witness good bringing up fortune and truth therefore know thou for this i entertain thee go presently and take this ring with thee deliver it to madam sylvia she loved me well delivered it to me not so i think she lives why dost thou cry alas wherefore shouldst thou pity her well give her that ring and therewithal this letter that's her chamber tell my lady i claim the promise for her heavenly picture your message done hie home unto my chamber where thou shalt find me sad and solitary o sir i find her milder than she was and yet she takes exceptions at your person no that it is

of many our contriving friends in rome petition us at home sextus pompeius hath given the dare to caesar and commands the empire of the sea our slippery people whose love is never linked to the deserver till his deserts are past begin to throw pompey the great and all his dignities upon his son who high in name and power higher than both in blood and life stands up for the main soldier whose quality going on the sides o' th' world may danger much is breeding which like the courser's hair hath yet but life and not a serpent's poison say our pleasure to such whose place is under us requires

necessity of time commands our services awhile but my full heart remains in use with you our italy shines o'er with civil swords sextus pompeius makes his approaches to the port of rome equality of two domestic powers breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength are newly grown to love the condemned pompey rich in his father's honor creeps apace into the hearts of such as have not thrived upon the present state whose numbers threaten and quietness grown sick of rest would purge by any desperate change my more particular and that which most with you should safe my going is fulvia's death she's dead my queen look here and at thy sovereign leisure read the garboils she awaked at the last best see when and where she died quarrel no more but be prepared to know the purposes i bear which are or cease as you shall give th' advice by the fire that quickens nilus' slime i go from hence thy soldier servant making peace or war as thou affects my precious queen forbear and give true evidence to his love which stands an honorable trial you'll heat my blood no more now by my sword  i'll leave you lady but that your royalty holds idleness your subject i should take you for idleness itself let us go come our separation so abides and flies that thou residing here goes yet with me and i hence fleeting here remain with thee away if we compose well here to parthia hark ventidius 'tis spoken well were we before our armies and to fight i should do thus thank you sit sir i learn you take things ill which are not so or being concern you not my being in egypt caesar what was 't to you how intend you practiced you do mistake your business my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause of this my letters before did satisfy you if you'll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have to make it with it must not be with this not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain on 't  very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another the third o' th' world is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife so much uncurbable her garboils caesar made out of her impatience which not wanted shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant did you too much disquiet for that you must but say i could not help it sir he fell upon me ere admitted then three kings i had newly feasted and did want of what i was i' th' morning but next day i told him of myself which was as much as to have asked him pardon let this fellow be nothing of our strife if we contend out of our question wipe him no lepidus let him speak the honor is sacred which he talks on now supposing that i lacked it but on caesar the article of my oath neglected rather and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge as nearly as i may i'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness nor my power work without it truth is that fulvia to have me out of egypt made wars here for which myself the ignorant motive do so far ask pardon as befits mine honor to stoop in such a case thou art a soldier only speak no more you wrong this presence therefore speak no more i am not married caesar let me hear agrippa further speak will caesar speak what power is in agrippa if i would say agrippa be it so to make this good may i never to this good purpose that so fairly shows dream of impediment let me have thy hand further this act of grace and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs i did not think to draw my sword 'gainst pompey for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me i must thank him only lest my remembrance suffer ill report at heel of that defy him where lies he what is his strength by land so is the fame would we had spoke together haste we for it yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we the business we have talked of let us lepidus not lack your company the world and my great office will sometimes divide me from your bosom goodnight sir my octavia read not my blemishes in the world's report i have not kept my square but that to come shall all be done by th' rule good night dear lady  good night sir now sirrah you do wish yourself in egypt if you can your reason say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher caesar's or mine speak this no more get thee gone say to ventidius i would speak with him he shall to parthia be it art or hap he hath spoken true the very dice

fear us pompey with thy sails we'll speak with thee at sea at land thou know'st how much we do o'ercount thee which do not be entreated to but weigh what it is worth embraced that's our offer i have heard it pompey and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you the beds i' th' east are soft and thanks to you that called me timelier than my purpose hither for i have gained by 't that will i pompey you have heard much and fair words to them show 's the way sir thus do they sir they take the flow o' th' nile by certain scales i' th' pyramid they know by th' height the lowness or the mean if dearth or foison follow the higher nilus swells the more it promises as it ebbs the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain and shortly comes to harvest ay lepidus they are so it is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is and moves with it own organs it lives by that which nourisheth it and the elements once out of it it transmigrates of it own color too 'tis so and the tears of it are wet with the health that pompey gives him else he is a very epicure these quicksands lepidus keep off them for you sink bear him ashore i'll pledge it for him pompey it ripens towards it strike the vessels ho here's to caesar be a child o' th' time come let's all take hands till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense in soft and delicate lethe cup us till the world go round cup us till the world go round and shall sir give 's your hand no further sir make me not offended in your distrust you shall not find though you be therein curious the least cause for what you seem to fear so the gods keep you and make the hearts of romans serve your ends we will here part the april's in her eyes it is love's spring and these the showers to bring it on be cheerful her tongue will not obey her heart nor can her heart inform her tongue the swan's down feather that stands upon the swell at the full of tide and neither way inclines come sir come i'll wrestle with you in my strength of love look here i have you thus i let you go and give you to the gods farewell nay nay octavia not only that  that were excusable that

and sickly he vented them most narrow measure lent me when the best hint was given him he not took 't or did it from his teeth gentle octavia let your best love draw to that point which seeks best to preserve it if i lose mine honor i lose myself better i were not yours than yours so branchless but as you requested yourself shall go between 's the meantime lady i'll raise the preparation of a war shall stain your brother make your soonest haste so your desires are yours when it appears to you where this begins turn your displeasure that way for our faults can never be so equal that your love can equally move with them provide your going choose your own company and command what cost your heart has mind to is it not strange canidius that from tarentum and brundusium he could so quickly cut the ionian sea and take in toryne you have heard on 't sweet a good rebuke which might have well becomed the best of men to taunt at slackness canidius we will fight with him by sea for that he dares us to 't by sea by sea i'll fight at sea our overplus of shipping will we burn and with the rest full manned from th' head of actium beat th' approaching caesar but if we fail we then can do 't at

out of thine eyes by looking back what i have left behind 'stroyed in dishonor egypt thou knew'st too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings and thou shouldst tow me after o'er my spirit thy full supremacy thou knew'st and that thy beck might from the bidding of the gods command me now i must to the young man send humble treaties dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness who with half the bulk o' th' world played as i pleased making and marring fortunes you did know how much you were my conqueror and that my sword made weak by my affection would obey it on all cause fall not a tear i say one of them rates all that is won and lost give me a kiss even this repays me  we sent our schoolmaster is he come back  love i am full of lead some wine within there and our viands fortune

shake thou to look on 't get thee back to caesar tell him thy entertainment look thou say he makes me angry with him for he seems proud and disdainful harping on what i am not what he knew i was he makes me angry and at this time most easy 'tis to do 't when my good stars that were my former guides have empty left their orbs and shot their fires into th' abysm of hell if he mislike my speech and

bardolph lead the men away as i return i will fetch off these justices i do see the bottom of justice shallow lord lord how subject we old men are to this vice of lying this same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about turnbull street and every third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the turk's tribute i do remember him at clement's inn like a man made after supper of a cheese paring when he was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife he was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible he was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores called him mandrake he came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle and swore they were his fancies or his good nights and now is this vice's dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of john o' gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and i'll be sworn he ne'er saw him but once in the tilt yard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal's men i saw it and told john o' gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel skin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court and now has he land and beefs well i'll be acquainted with him if i return and 't shall go hard but i'll make him a philosopher's two stones to me if the young dace be a bait for the old pike i see no reason in the law of nature but i may snap at him let time shape and there an end what's your name sir of what condition are you and of what place i pray well then colevile is your name a knight is your degree and your place the dale colevile shall be still your name a traitor your degree and the dungeon your place a place deep enough so shall you be still colevile of the dale as good a man as he sir whoe'er i am do you yield sir or shall i sweat for you if i do sweat they are the drops of thy lovers and they weep for thy death therefore rouse up fear and trembling and do observance to my mercy i have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name an i had but a belly of any indifferency i were simply the most active fellow in europe my womb my womb my womb undoes me here comes our general i would be sorry my lord but it should be thus i never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valor do you think me a swallow an arrow or a bullet have i in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought i have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility i have foundered ninescore and odd posts and here travel tainted as i am have in my pure and immaculate valor taken sir john colevile of the dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy but what of that he saw me and yielded that i may justly say with the hook nosed fellow of rome there cousin i came saw and overcame i know not here he is and here i yield him and i beseech your grace let it be booked with the rest of this day's deeds or by the lord i will have it in a particular ballad else with mine own picture on the top on 't colevile kissing my foot to the which course if i be enforced if you do not all show like gilt twopences to me and i in the clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element which show like pins' heads to her believe not the word of the noble therefore let me have right and let desert mount let it shine then let it do something my good lord that may do me good and call it what you will and a famous true subject took him i know not how they sold themselves but thou like a kind fellow gavest thyself away gratis and i thank thee for thee my lord i beseech you give me leave to go through gloucestershire and when you come to court stand my good lord pray in your good report i would you had but the wit 'twere better than your dukedom good faith this same young sober blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but that's no marvel he drinks no wine there's never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood and making many fish meals that they fall into a kind of male green sickness and then when they marry they get wenches they are generally fools and cowards which some of us should be too but for inflammation a good sherris sack hath a two fold operation in it it ascends me into the brain dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which delivered o'er to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit the second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts' extremes it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puffed up with this retinue doth any deed of courage and this valor comes of sherris so that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it a work and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use hereof comes it that prince harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant if i had a thousand sons the first human principle i would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack how now bardolph let them go i'll through gloucestershire and there will i visit master robert shallow esquire i have him already temp'ring between my finger and my thumb and shortly will i seal with him come away you must excuse me master robert shallow i'll follow you good master robert shallow bardolph look to our horses if i were sawed into quantities i should make four dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as master shallow it is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his they by observing of him do bear themselves like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned into a justice like servingman their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild geese if i had a suit to master shallow i would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master if to his men i would curry with master shallow that no man could better command his servants it is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed of their company i will devise matter enough out of this shallow to keep prince harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four terms or two actions and he shall laugh without intervallums o it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders o you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up i come master shallow i come master shallow fore god you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich this davy serves you for good uses he is your servingman and your husband there's a merry heart good master silence i'll give you a health for that anon i did not think master silence had been a man of this mettle well said master silence health and long life to you master silence why now you have done me right 'tis so from the court let him come in how now

lord shallow be what thou wilt i am fortune's steward get on thy boots we'll ride all night o sweet pistol away bardolph come pistol utter more to me and withal devise something to do thyself good boot boot master shallow i know the young king is sick for me let us take any man's horses the laws of england are at my commandment blessed are they that have been my friends and woe to my lord chief justice stand here by me master robert shallow i will make the king do you grace i will leer upon him as he comes by and do but mark the countenance that he will give me come here pistol stand behind me o if i had had time to have made new liveries i would have bestowed the thousand pound i borrowed of you but 'tis no matter this poor show doth better this doth infer the zeal i had to see him it shows my earnestness of affection  my devotion  as it were to ride day and night and not to deliberate not to remember not to have patience to shift me  but to stand stained with travel and sweating with desire to see him thinking of nothing else putting all affairs else in oblivion as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him i will deliver her god save thy grace king hal my royal hal god save thee my sweet boy my king my jove i speak to thee my heart master shallow i owe you a thousand pound that can hardly be master shallow do not you grieve at this i shall be sent for in private to him look you he must seem thus to the world fear not your advancements i will be the man yet that shall make you great sir i will be as good as my word this that you heard was but a color fear no

leads him were slyly crept into his human powers and gave him graceful posture then our office may during his power go sleep in that there's comfort i heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would he appear i' th' marketplace nor on him put the napless vesture of humility nor showing as the manner is his wounds to th' people beg their stinking breaths it was his word o he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him and the desire of the nobles 'tis most like he will so it must fall out to him or our authority's for an end we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them that to 's power he would have made them mules silenced their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms holding them in human action and capacity of no more soul

told him as you were lessoned when he had no power but was a petty servant to the state he was your enemy ever spake against your liberties and the charters that you bear i' th' body of the weal and now arriving a place of potency and sway o' th' state if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to th' plebeii your voices might be curses to yourselves you should have said that as his worthy deeds did claim no less than what he stood for so his gracious nature would think upon you for your voices and translate his malice towards you into love standing your friendly lord did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush why had your bodies no heart among you or had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of judgment get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties make them of no more voice

ballad of a fish that appeared upon the coast on wednesday the fourscore of april forty thousand fathom above water and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids it was thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her the ballad is very pitiful and as true five justices' hands at it and witnesses more than my pack will hold

pettitoes till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket it was senseless 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse i could have filed keys off that hung in chains no hearing no feeling but my sir's song and admiring the nothing of it so that in this time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come in with a hubbub against his daughter and the king's son and scared my choughs from the chaff i had not left a purse alive in the whole army if they have overheard me now why hanging i am a poor fellow sir i am a poor fellow sir i know you well enough are you in earnest sir i smell the trick on 't indeed i have had earnest but i cannot with conscience take it adieu sir i understand the business i hear it to have an open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a cutpurse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for th' other senses i see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive what an exchange had this been without boot what a boot is here with this exchange sure the gods do this year connive at us and we may do anything extempore the prince himself is about a piece of iniquity stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels if i thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal i would not do 't i hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am i constant to my profession aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain every lane's end every shop church session hanging

the curses he shall have the tortures he shall feel will break the back of man the heart of monster not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though removed fifty times shall all come under the hangman which though it be great pity yet it is necessary an old sheep whistling rogue a ram tender to offer to have his daughter come into grace some say he shall be stoned but that death is too soft for him say i draw our throne into a sheepcote all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy he has a son who shall be flayed alive then 'nointed over with honey set on the head of a wasps' nest then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead then recovered again with aqua vitae or some other hot infusion then raw as he is and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims shall he be set against a brick wall the sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he is to behold him with flies blown to death but what talk we of

right hand i will but look upon the hedge and follow you if i had a mind to be honest i see fortune would not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth i am courted now with a double occasion gold and a means to do the prince my master good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement i will bring these two moles these blind ones aboard him if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for being so far officious for i am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to 't to him will i present them there may be matter in it beseech you sir were you present at this relation i would most gladly know the issue of it now had i not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head i brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherd's daughter so he then took her to be  who began to be much seasick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscovered but 'tis all one to me for had i been the finder out of this secret it would not have relished among my other discredits here come those i have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune i know you are now sir a gentleman born i humbly

"Ado_Dogberry": "are you good men and true nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the prince's watch first who think you the most

if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty truly by your office you may but i think they that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company truly i would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baas will never answer a calf when he bleats this is the end of the charge you constable are to present the prince's own

liege i did deny no prisoners but i remember when the fight was done when i was dry with rage and extreme toil breathless and faint leaning upon my sword came there a certain lord neat and trimly dressed fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reaped showed like a stubble land at harvest home he was perfum\u00e8d like a milliner and 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held a pouncet box which ever and anon he gave his nose and took 't away again who therewith angry when it next came there took it in snuff and still he smiled and talked and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by he called them untaught knaves unmannerly to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility with many holiday and lady terms he questioned me amongst the rest demanded my prisoners in your majesty's behalf i then all smarting with my wounds being cold to be so pestered with a popinjay out of my grief and my impatience answered neglectingly i know not what  he should or he should not for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a waiting gentlewoman of guns and drums and wounds god save the mark  and telling me the sovereignest thing on earth was parmacety for an inward bruise and that it was great pity so it was this villainous saltpeter should be digged out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroyed so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier this bald unjointed chat of his my lord i answered indirectly as i said and i beseech you let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty revolted mortimer he never did fall off my sovereign liege but by the chance of war to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds those mouth\u00e8d wounds which valiantly he took when on the gentle severn's sedgy bank in single opposition hand to hand he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severn's flood who then affrighted with their bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank blood stain\u00e8d with these valiant combatants never did bare and rotten policy color her working with such deadly wounds nor never could the noble mortimer receive so many and all willingly then let not him be slandered with revolt an if the devil come and roar for them i will not send them i will after straight and tell him so for i will ease my heart albeit i make a hazard of my head speak of mortimer zounds i will speak of him and let my soul want mercy if i do not join with him yea on his part i'll empty all these veins and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust but i will lift the downtrod mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king as this ingrate and cankered bolingbroke he will forsooth have all my prisoners and when i urged the ransom once again of my wife's brother then his cheek looked pale and on my face he turned an eye of death trembling even at the name of mortimer but soft i pray you did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown nay then i cannot blame his cousin king that wished him on the barren mountains starve but shall it be that you that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornation shall it be that you a world of curses undergo being the agents or base second means the cords the ladder or the hangman rather o pardon me that i descend so low to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtle king shall it for shame be spoken in these days or fill up chronicles in time to come that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf as both of you god pardon it have done to put down richard that sweet lovely rose and plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke and shall it in more shame be further spoken that you are fooled discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames you underwent no yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banished honors and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again revenge the jeering and disdained contempt of this proud king who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore i say  if he fall in good night or sink or swim send danger from the east unto the west so honor cross it from the north to south and let them grapple o the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honor from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line could never touch the ground and pluck up drown\u00e8d honor by the locks so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival all her dignities but out upon this half faced fellowship i cry you mercy i'll keep them all by god he shall not have a scot of them no if a scot would save his soul he shall not i'll keep them by this hand nay i will that's flat he said he would not ransom mortimer forbade my tongue to speak of mortimer but i will find him when he lies asleep and in his ear i'll hollo mortimer nay i'll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but mortimer and give it him to keep his anger still in motion all studies here i solemnly defy save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same sword and buckler prince of wales  but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance  i would have him poisoned with a pot of ale why look you i am whipped and scourged with rods nettled and stung with pismires when i hear of this vile politician bolingbroke in richard's time what do you call the place a plague upon it it is in gloucestershire 'twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept his uncle york where i first bowed my knee unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke 'sblood when you and he came back from ravenspurgh you say true why what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me look when his infant fortune came to age and gentle harry percy and kind cousin o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me good uncle tell your tale i have done i have done i' faith of york is it not i smell it upon my life it will do well why it cannot choose but be a noble plot and then the power of scotland and of york to join with mortimer ha in faith it is exceedingly well aimed he does he does we'll be revenged on him uncle adieu o let the hours be short till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport but for mine own part my lord i could be well contented to be there in respect of the love i bear your house he could be contented why is he not then in respect of the love he bears our house he shows in this he loves his own barn better than he loves our house let me see some more the purpose you undertake is dangerous why that's certain 'tis dangerous to take a cold to sleep to drink but i tell you my lord fool out of this nettle danger we pluck this flower safety the purpose you undertake is dangerous the friends you have named uncertain the time itself unsorted and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition say you so say you so i say unto you again you are a shallow cowardly hind and you lie what a lack brain is this by the lord our plot is a good plot as ever was laid our friends true and constant a good plot good friends and full of expectation an excellent plot very good friends what a frosty spirited rogue is this why my lord of york commends the plot and the general course of the action zounds an i were now by this rascal i could brain him with his lady's fan is there not my father my uncle and myself lord edmund mortimer my lord of york and owen glendower is there not besides the douglas have i not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month and are they not some of them set forward already what a pagan rascal is this an infidel ha you shall see now in very sincerity of fear and cold heart will he to the king and lay open all our proceedings o i could divide myself and go to buffets for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honorable an action hang him let him tell the king we are prepared i will set forward tonight how now kate i must leave you within these two hours what ho is gilliams with the packet gone hath butler brought those horses from the sheriff what horse a roan a crop ear is it not that roan shall be my throne well i will back him straight o esperance bid butler lead him forth into the park what say'st thou my lady why my horse my love my horse so far afoot i shall be weary love away away you trifler love i love thee not i care not for thee kate this is no world to play with mammets and to tilt with lips we must have bloody noses and cracked crowns and pass them current too gods me my horse  what say'st thou kate what wouldst thou have with me come wilt thou see me ride and when i am a horseback i will swear i love thee infinitely but hark you kate i must not have you henceforth question me whither i go nor reason whereabout whither i must i must and to conclude this evening must i leave you gentle kate i know you wise but yet no farther wise than harry percy's wife constant you are but yet a woman and for secrecy no lady closer for i well believe thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know and so far will i trust thee gentle kate not an inch further but hark you kate whither i go thither shall you go too today will i set forth tomorrow you will this content you kate lord mortimer and cousin glendower will you sit down and uncle worcester  a plague upon it i have forgot the map and you in hell as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of why so it would have done at the same season if your mother's cat had but kittened though yourself had never been born and i say the earth was not of my mind if you suppose as fearing you it shook o then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire and not in fear of your nativity diseas\u00e8d nature oftentimes breaks forth in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth is with a kind of colic pinched and vexed by the imprisoning of unruly wind within her womb which for enlargement striving shakes the old beldam earth and topples down steeples and moss grown towers at your birth our grandam earth having this distemp'rature in passion shook i think there's no man speaks better welsh i'll to dinner why so can i or so can any man but will they come when you do call for them and i can teach thee coz to shame the devil by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil if thou have power to raise him bring him hither and i'll be sworn i have power to shame him hence o while you live tell truth and shame the devil home without boots and in foul weather too how 'scapes he agues in the devil's name methinks my moiety north from burton here in quantity equals not one of yours see how this river comes me cranking in and cuts me from the best of all my land a huge half moon a monstrous cantle out i'll have the current in this place dammed up and here the smug and silver trent shall run in a new channel fair and evenly it shall not wind with such a deep indent to rob me of so rich a bottom here i'll have it so a little charge will do it will not you who shall say me nay let me not understand you then speak it in welsh marry and i am glad of it with all my heart i had rather be a kitten and cry mew than one of these same meter balladmongers i had rather hear a brazen can'stick turned or a dry wheel grate on the axletree and that would set my teeth nothing an edge nothing so much as mincing poetry 'tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag i do not care i'll give thrice so much land to any well deserving friend but in the way of bargain mark you me i'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair are the indentures drawn shall we be gone i cannot choose sometime he angers me with telling me of the moldwarp and the ant of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies and of a dragon and a finless fish a clip winged griffin and a moulten raven a couching lion and a ramping cat and such a deal of skimble skamble stuff as puts me from my faith i tell you what  he held me last night at least nine hours in reckoning up the several devils' names that were his lackeys i cried hum and well go to but marked him not a word o he is as tedious as a tired horse a railing wife worse than a smoky house i had rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill far than feed on cates and have him talk to me in any summer house in christendom well i am schooled good manners be your speed here come our wives and let us take our leave come kate thou art perfect in lying down come quick quick that i may lay my head in thy lap now i perceive the devil understands welsh and 'tis no marvel he is so humorous by 'r lady he is a good musician i had rather hear lady my brach howl in irish no neither 'tis a woman's fault to the welsh lady's bed peace she sings come kate i'll have your song too not yours in good sooth heart you swear like a comfit maker's wife not you in good sooth and as true as i live and as god shall mend me and as sure as day  and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths as if thou never walk'st further than finsbury swear me kate like a lady as thou art a good mouth filling oath and leave in sooth and such protest of pepper gingerbread to velvet guards and sunday citizens come sing 'tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast teacher an the indentures be drawn i'll away within these two hours and so come in when you will well said my noble scot if speaking truth in this fine age were not thought flattery such attribution should the douglas have as not a soldier of this season's stamp should go so general current through the world by god i cannot flatter i do defy the tongues of soothers but a braver place in my heart's love hath no man than yourself nay task me to my word approve me lord do so and 'tis well what letters hast thou there i can but thank you letters from him why comes he not himself zounds how has he the leisure to be sick in such a justling time who leads his power under whose government come they along sick now droop now this sickness doth infect the very lifeblood of our enterprise 'tis catching hither even to our camp he writes me here that inward sickness  and that his friends by deputation could not so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet to lay so dangerous and dear a trust on any soul removed but on his own yet doth he give us bold advertisement that with our small conjunction we should on to see how fortune is disposed to us for as he writes there is no quailing now because the king is certainly possessed of all our purposes what say you to it a perilous gash a very limb lopped off and yet in faith it is not his present want seems more than we shall find it were it good to set the exact wealth of all our states all at one cast to set so rich a main on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour it were not good for therein should we read the very bottom and the soul of hope the very list the very utmost bound of all our fortunes a rendezvous a home to fly unto if that the devil and mischance look big upon the maidenhead of our affairs you strain too far i rather of his absence make this use it lends a luster and more great opinion a larger dare to our great enterprise than if the earl were here for men must think if we without his help can make a head to push against a kingdom with his help we shall o'erturn it topsy turvy down yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole my cousin vernon welcome by my soul no harm what more he shall be welcome too where is his son the nimble footed madcap prince of wales and his comrades that daffed the world aside and bid it pass no more no more worse than the sun in march this praise doth nourish agues let them come they come like sacrifices in their trim and to the fire eyed maid of smoky war all hot and bleeding will we offer them the mail\u00e8d mars shall on his altar sit up to the ears in blood i am on fire to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh and yet not ours come let me taste my horse who is to bear me like a thunderbolt against the bosom of the prince of wales harry to harry shall hot horse to horse meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse o that glendower were come what may the king's whole battle reach unto forty let it be my father and glendower being both away the powers of us may serve so great a day come let us take a muster speedily doomsday is near die all die merrily we'll fight with him tonight why say you so looks he not for supply his is certain ours is doubtful tonight say i so are the horses of the enemy in general journey bated and brought low the better part of ours are full of rest welcome sir walter blunt and would to god you were of our determination some of us love you well and even those some envy your great deservings and good name because you are not of our quality but stand against us like an enemy the king is kind and well we know the king knows at what time to promise when to pay my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears and when he was not six and twenty strong sick in the world's regard wretched and low a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home my father gave him welcome to the shore and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster to sue his livery and beg his peace with tears of innocency and terms of zeal my father in kind heart and pity moved swore him assistance and performed it too now when the lords and barons of the realm perceived northumberland did lean to him the more and less came in with cap and knee met him in boroughs cities villages

itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun your virtue is to make him worthy whose offense subdues him and curse that justice did it who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick man's appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil he that depends upon your favors swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes hang you trust you with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland what's the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another what's their seeking hang 'em they say they'll sit by th' fire and presume to know what's done i' th' capitol who's like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes they say there's grain enough would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword i'd make a quarry with thousands of these quartered slaves as high as i could pick my lance they are dissolved hang 'em they said they were an hungry sighed forth proverbs that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answered and a petition granted them a strange one to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look pale they threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon shouting their emulation five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice one's junius brutus sicinius velutus and i know not 'sdeath the rabble should have first unroofed the city ere so prevailed with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrection's arguing go get you home you fragments here what's the matter i am glad on 't then we shall ha' means to vent our musty superfluity see our best elders they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you to 't i sin in envying his nobility and were i anything but what i am i would wish me only he were half to half the world by th' ears and he upon my party i'd revolt to make only my wars with him he is a lion that i am proud to hunt sir it is and i am constant titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus' face what art

that we with smoking swords may march from hence to help our fielded friends come blow thy blast tullus aufidius is he within your walls o they are at it they fear us not but issue forth their city  now put your shields before your hearts and fight with hearts more proof than shields advance brave titus they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts which makes me sweat with wrath come on my fellows

these movers that do prize their hours at a cracked drachma cushions leaden spoons irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would bury with those that wore them these base slaves ere yet the fight be done pack up down with them and hark what noise the general makes to him there is the man of my soul's hate aufidius piercing our romans then valiant titus take convenient numbers to make good the city whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste to help cominius sir praise me not my work hath yet not warmed me fare you well the blood i drop is rather physical than dangerous to me to aufidius thus i will appear and fight thy friend no less than those she placeth highest so farewell come i too late come i too late o let me clip you in arms as sound as when i wooed in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done and tapers burnt to bedward as with a man busied about decrees condemning some to death and some to exile ransoming him or pitying threat'ning th' other holding corioles in the name of rome even like a fawning greyhound in the leash to let him slip at will let him alone he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen the common file a plague tribunes for them  the mouse ne'er shunned the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they will the time serve to tell i do not think where is the enemy are you lords o' th' field if not why cease you till you are so how lies their battle know you on which side they have placed their men of trust i do beseech you by all the battles wherein we have fought by th' blood we have shed together by th' vows we have made to endure friends that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates and that you not delay the present but filling the air with swords advanced and darts we prove this very hour those are they that most are willing if any such be here  as it were sin to doubt that love this painting wherein you see me smeared if any fear lesser his person than an ill report if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his country's dearer than himself let him alone or so many so minded wave thus to express his disposition and follow martius o me alone make you a sword of me if these shows be not outward which of you but is four volsces none of you but is able to bear against the great aufidius a shield as hard as his a certain number though thanks to all must i select from all the rest shall bear the business in some other fight as cause will be obeyed please you to march and i shall quickly draw out my command which men are best inclined i'll fight with none but thee for i do hate thee worse than a promise breaker let the first budger die the other's slave and the gods doom him after within these three hours tullus alone i fought in your corioles' walls and made what work i pleased 'tis not my blood wherein thou seest me masked for thy revenge wrench up thy power to th' highest pray now no more my mother who has a charter to extol her blood when she does praise me grieves me i have done as you have done that's what i can induced as you have been that's for my country he that has but effected his good will hath overta'en mine act i have some wounds upon me and they smart to hear themselves remembered i thank you general but cannot make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it and stand upon my common part with those that have beheld the doing may these same instruments which you profane never sound more when drums and trumpets shall i' th' field prove flatterers let courts and cities be made all of false faced soothing when steel grows soft as the parasite's silk let him be made an ovator for th' wars no more i say for that i have not washed my nose that bled or foiled some debile wretch which without note here's many else have done you shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical as if i loved my little should be dieted in praises sauced with lies i will go wash and when my face is fair you shall perceive whether i blush or no howbeit i thank you i mean to stride your steed and at all times to undercrest your good addition to th' fairness of my power the gods begin to mock me i that now refused most princely gifts am bound to beg of my lord general i sometime lay here in corioles at a poor man's house he used me kindly he cried to me i saw him prisoner but then aufidius was within my view and wrath o'erwhelmed my pity i request you to give my poor host freedom by jupiter forgot i am weary yea my memory is tired have we no wine here no more of this it does offend my heart pray now no more o you have i know petitioned all the gods for my prosperity my gracious silence hail wouldst thou have laughed had i come coffined home that weep'st to see me triumph ah my dear such eyes the widows in corioles wear and mothers that lack sons and live you yet o my sweet lady pardon menenius ever ever your hand and yours ere in our own house i do shade my head the good patricians must be visited from whom i have received not only greetings but with them change of honors know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs your honors pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them no sir yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words you soothed not therefore hurt not but your people i love them as they weigh i had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered i do owe them still my life and services i do beseech you let me o'erleap that custom for i cannot put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing it is a part that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people to brag unto them thus i did and thus show them th' unaching scars which i should hide as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only what must i say i pray sir plague upon 't i cannot bring my tongue to such a pace look sir my wounds i got them in my country's service when some certain of your brethren roared and ran from th' noise of our own drums think upon me hang 'em i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by 'em bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean so here comes a brace  you know the cause sir of my standing here mine own desert ay but not mine own desire no sir 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging well then i pray your price o' th' consulship kindly sir i pray let me ha 't i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir what say you a match sir there's in all two worthy voices begged i have your alms adieu pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown your enigma you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love i will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them 'tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practice the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you i may be consul i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther most sweet voices better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve why in this woolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that does appear their needless vouches custom calls me to 't what custom wills in all things should we do 't the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heaped for truth to o'erpeer rather than fool it so let the high office and the honor go to one that would do thus i am half through the one part suffered the other will i do here come more voices  your voices for your voices i have fought watched for your voices for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six i have seen and heard of for your voices have done many things some less some more your voices indeed i would be consul worthy voices is this done where at the senate house may i change these garments that i'll straight do and knowing myself again repair to th' senate house tullus aufidius then had made new head so then the volsces stand but as at first ready when time shall prompt them to make road upon 's again saw you aufidius spoke he of me how what at antium lives he i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully welcome home behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues o' th' common mouth i do despise them for they do prank them in authority against all noble sufferance ha what is that what makes this change have i had children's voices are these your herd must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues what are your offices you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth have you not set them on it is a purposed thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility suffer 't and live with such as cannot rule nor ever will be ruled why this was known before have you informed them sithence why then should i be consul by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune tell me of corn this was my speech and i will speak 't again now as i live i will my nobler friends i crave their pardons for the mutable rank scented meiny let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves i say again in soothing them we nourish 'gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have plowed for sowed and scattered by mingling them with us the honored number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars how no more as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tetter us yet sought the very way to catch them choler were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove 'twould be my mind shall remain hear you this triton of the minnows mark you his absolute shall shall o good but most unwise patricians why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer that with his peremptory shall being but the horn and noise o' th' monster's wants not spirit to say he'll turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity if you are learned be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the great'st taste most palates theirs they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his shall his popular shall against a graver bench than ever frowned in greece by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter 'twixt the gap of both and take the one by th' other whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o' th' storehouse gratis as 'twas used sometime in greece  though there the people had more absolute power i say they nourished disobedience fed the ruin of the state i'll give my reasons more worthier than their voices they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assured they ne'er did service for 't being pressed to th' war even when the navel of the state was touched they would not thread the gates this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis being i' th' war their mutinies and revolts wherein they showed most valor spoke not for them th' accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the native of our so frank donation well what then how shall this bosom multiplied digest the senate's courtesy let deeds express what's like to be their words we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o' th' senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles no take more what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal this double worship  where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom cannot conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance it must omit real necessities and give way the while to unstable slightness purpose so barred it follows nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you  you that will be less fearful than discreet that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change on 't that prefer a noble life before a long and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic that's sure of death without it at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue let them not lick the sweet which is their poison your dishonor mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should become 't not having the power to do the good it would for th' ill which doth control 't thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee what should the people do with these bald tribunes on whom depending their obedience fails to th' greater bench in a rebellion when what's not meet but what must be was law then were they chosen in a better hour let what is meet be said it must be meet and throw their power i' th' dust hence old goat hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones out of thy garments that is the way to lay the city flat to bring the roof to the foundation and bury all which yet distinctly ranges in heaps and piles of ruin no i'll die here there's some among you have beheld me fighting come try upon yourselves what you have seen me stand fast we have as many friends as enemies i would they were barbarians as they are though in rome littered not romans as they are not though calved i' th' porch o' th' capitol on fair ground i could beat forty of them let them pull all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight yet will i still be thus to them i muse my mother does not approve me further who was wont to call them woolen vassals things created to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads in congregations to yawn be still and wonder when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war i talk of you why did you wish me milder would you have me false to my nature rather say i play the man i am let go let them hang what must i do well what then what then for them i cannot do it to the gods must i then do 't to them tush tush why force you this must i go show them my unbarb\u00e8d sconce must i with my base tongue give to my noble heart a lie that it must bear well i will do 't yet were there but this single plot to lose this mold of martius they to dust should grind it and throw 't against the wind to th' marketplace you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to th' life well i must do 't away my disposition and possess me some harlot's spirit my throat of war be turned which choir\u00e8d with my drum into a pipe small as an eunuch or the virgin voice that babies lull asleep the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks and schoolboys' tears take up the glasses of my sight a beggar's tongue make motion through my lips and my armed knees who bowed but in my stirrup bend like his that hath received an alms i will not do 't lest i surcease to honor mine own truth and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness pray be content mother i am going to the marketplace chide me no more i'll mountebank their loves cog their hearts from them and come home beloved of all the trades in rome look i am going commend me to my wife i'll return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do i' th' way of flattery further the word is mildly pray you let us go let them accuse me by invention i will answer in mine honor well mildly be it then mildly ay as an hostler that for th' poorest piece will bear the knave by th' volume th' honored gods keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men plant love among 's throng our large temples with the shows of peace and not our streets with war first hear me speak shall i be charged no further than this present must all determine here i am content scratches with briars scars to move laughter only what is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice i am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again say then 'tis true i ought so how traitor the fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the people call me their traitor thou injurious tribune within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths in thy hands clutched as many millions in thy lying tongue both numbers i would say thou liest unto thee with a voice as free as i do pray the gods what do you prate of service you i'll know no further let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death vagabond exile flaying pent to linger but with a grain a day i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word nor check my courage for what they can give to have 't with saying good morrow you common cry of curs whose breath i hate as reek o' th' rotten fens whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air i banish you and here remain with your uncertainty let every feeble rumor shake your hearts your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair have the power still to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance which finds not till it feels making but reservation of yourselves still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows despising for you the city thus i turn my back there is a world elsewhere come leave your tears a brief farewell the beast with many heads butts me away nay mother where is your ancient courage you were used to say extremities was the trier of spirits that common chances common men could bear that when the sea was calm all boats alike showed mastership in floating fortune's blows when most struck home being gentle wounded craves a noble cunning you were used to load me with precepts that would make invincible the heart that conned them nay i prithee woman  what what what i shall be loved when i am lacked nay mother resume that spirit when you were wont to say if you had been the wife of hercules six of his labors you'd have done and saved your husband so much sweat cominius droop not adieu farewell my wife my mother i'll do well yet thou old and true menenius thy tears are salter than a younger man's and venomous to thine eyes my sometime general i have seen thee stern and thou hast oft beheld heart hard'ning spectacles tell these sad women 'tis fond to wail inevitable strokes as 'tis to laugh at 'em my mother you wot well my hazards still have been your solace and  believe 't not lightly though i go alone like to a lonely dragon that his fen makes feared and talked of more than seen your son will or exceed the common or be caught with cautelous baits and practice fare you well thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one that's yet unbruised bring me but out at gate  come my sweet wife my dearest mother and my friends of noble touch when i am forth bid me farewell and smile i pray you come while i remain above the ground you shall hear from me still and never of me aught but what is like me formerly give me thy hand come a goodly city is this antium city 'tis i that made thy widows many an heir of these fair edifices 'fore my wars have i heard groan and drop then know me not lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones in puny battle slay me save you sir direct me if it be your will where great aufidius lies is he in antium which is his house beseech you thank you sir farewell o world thy slippery turns friends now fast sworn whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart whose hours whose bed whose meal and exercise are still together who twin as 'twere in love unseparable shall within this hour on a dissension of a doit break out to bitterest enmity so fellest foes whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep to take the one the other by some chance some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends and interjoin their issues so with me my birthplace hate i and my love's upon this enemy town i'll enter if he slay me he does fair justice if he give me way i'll do his country service a goodly house the feast smells well but i appear not like a guest i have deserved no better entertainment in being coriolanus away now th' art troublesome let me but stand i will not hurt your hearth a gentleman true so i am follow your function go and batten on cold bits under the canopy ay i' th' city of kites and crows no i serve not thy master ay 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress thou prat'st and prat'st serve with thy trencher hence if tullus not yet thou know'st me and seeing me dost not think me for the man i am necessity commands me name myself a name unmusical to the volscians' ears and harsh in sound to thine prepare thy brow to frown know'st thou me yet my name is caius martius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief thereto witness may my surname coriolanus the painful service the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname a good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains the cruelty and envy of the people permitted by our dastard nobles who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest and suffered me by th' voice of slaves to be whooped out of rome now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope  mistake me not to save my life for if i had feared death of all the men i' th' world i would have 'voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight and make my misery serve thy turn so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee for i will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends but if so be thou dar'st not this and that to prove more fortunes thou 'rt tired then in a word i also am longer to live most weary and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever followed thee with hate drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee service you bless me gods what's the matter away wife mother child i know not my affairs are servanted to others though i owe my revenge properly my remission lies in volscian breasts that we have been familiar ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather than pity note how much therefore begone mine ears against your suits are stronger than your gates against my force yet for i loved thee take this along i writ it for thy sake and would have sent it another word menenius i will not hear thee speak this man aufidius was my beloved in rome yet thou behold'st we will before the walls of rome tomorrow set down our host my partner in this action you must report to th' volscian lords how plainly i have borne this business this last old man whom with a cracked heart i have sent to rome loved me above the measure of a father nay godded me indeed their latest refuge was to send him for whose old love i have  though i showed sourly to him once more offered the first conditions which they did refuse and cannot now accept to grace him only that thought he could do more a very little i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits nor from the state nor private friends hereafter will i lend ear to ha what shout is this shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time 'tis made i will not my wife comes foremost then the honored mold wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand the grandchild to her blood but out affection all bond and privilege of nature break let it be virtuous to be obstinate what is that curtsy worth or those doves' eyes which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not of stronger earth than others my mother bows as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod and my young boy hath an aspect of intercession which great nature cries deny not let the volsces plow rome and harrow italy i'll never be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin these eyes are not the same i wore in rome like a dull actor now i have forgot my part and i am out even to a full disgrace best of my flesh forgive my tyranny but do not say for that forgive our romans o a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss i carried from thee dear and my true lip hath virgined it e'er since you gods i prate and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted sink my knee i' th' earth of thy deep duty more impression show than that of

churchmen take delight in broils fie uncle beaufort i have heard you preach that malice was a great and grievous sin and will not you maintain the thing you teach but prove a chief offender in the same o loving uncle kind duke of gloucester  how joyful am i made by this contract away my masters trouble us no more but join in friendship as your lords have done and those occasions uncle were of force  therefore my loving lords our pleasure is that richard be restor\u00e8d to his blood if richard will be true not that alone but all the whole inheritance i give that doth belong unto the house of york from whence you spring by lineal descent stoop then and set your knee against my foot and in reguerdon of that duty done i girt thee with the valiant sword of york rise richard like a true plantagenet and rise created princely duke of york when gloucester says the word king henry goes for friendly counsel cuts off many foes is this the lord talbot uncle gloucester that hath so long been resident in france welcome brave captain and victorious lord when i was young as yet i am not old  i do remember how my father said a stouter champion never handled sword long since we were resolv\u00e8d of your truth your faithful service and your toil in war yet never have you tasted our reward or been reguerdoned with so much as thanks because till now we never saw your face therefore stand up and for these good deserts we here create you earl of shrewsbury and in our coronation take your place stain to thy countrymen thou hear'st thy doom be packing therefore thou that wast a knight henceforth we banish thee on pain of death and now my lord protector view the letter sent from our uncle duke of burgundy what doth my uncle burgundy revolt is that the worst this letter doth contain why then lord talbot there shall talk with him and give him chastisement for this abuse  how say you my lord are you not content then gather strength and march unto him straight let him perceive how ill we brook his treason and what offense it is to flout his friends be patient lords and give them leave to speak  say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim and wherefore crave you combat or with whom what is that wrong whereof you both complain first let me know and then i'll answer you good lord what madness rules in brainsick men when for so slight and frivolous a cause such factious emulations shall arise good cousins both of york and somerset quiet yourselves i pray and be at peace come hither you that would be combatants henceforth i charge you as you love our favor quite to forget this quarrel and the cause  and you my lords remember where we are in france amongst a fickle wavering nation if they perceive dissension in our looks and that within ourselves we disagree how will their grudging stomachs be provoked to willful disobedience and rebel besides what infamy will there arise when foreign princes shall be certified that for a toy a thing of no regard king henry's peers and chief nobility destroyed themselves and lost the realm of france o think upon the conquest of my father my tender years and let us not forgo that for a trifle that was bought with blood let me be umpire in this doubtful strife i see no reason if i wear this rose that anyone should therefore be suspicious i more incline to somerset than york both are my kinsmen and i love them both as well they may upbraid me with my crown because forsooth the king of scots is crowned but your discretions better can persuade than i am able to instruct or teach and therefore as we hither came in peace so let us still continue peace and love cousin of york we institute your grace to be our regent in these parts of france  and good my lord of somerset unite your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot and like true subjects sons of your progenitors go cheerfully together and digest your angry choler on your enemies ourself my lord protector and the rest after some respite will return to callice from thence to england where i hope ere long to be presented by your victories with charles alanson and that traitorous rout have you perused the letters from the pope the emperor and the earl of armagnac how doth your grace affect their motion ay marry uncle for i always thought it was both impious and unnatural that such immanity and bloody strife should reign among professors of one faith marriage uncle alas my years are young and fitter is my study and my books than wanton dalliance with a paramour yet call th' ambassadors and as you please so let them have their answers every one i shall be well content with any choice tends to god's glory and my country's weal my lords ambassadors your several suits have been considered and debated on your purpose is both good and reasonable and therefore are we certainly resolved to draw conditions of a friendly peace which by my lord of winchester we mean shall be transported presently to france in argument and proof of which contract bear her this jewel pledge of my affection  and so my lord protector see them guarded and safely brought to dover where inshipped commit them to the fortune of the sea your wondrous rare description noble earl of beauteous margaret hath astonished me her virtues grac\u00e8d with external gifts do breed love's settled passions in my heart and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwrack or arrive where i may have fruition of her love and otherwise will henry ne'er presume  therefore my lord protector give consent that margaret may be england's royal queen whether it be through force of your report my noble lord of suffolk or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love i cannot tell but this i am assured i feel such sharp dissension in my breast such fierce alarums both of hope and fear as i am sick with working of my thoughts take therefore shipping post my lord to france agree to any covenants and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crowned king henry's faithful and anointed queen for your expenses and sufficient charge among the people gather up a tenth be gone i say for till you do return i rest perplex\u00e8d with a thousand cares  and you good uncle banish all offense if you do censure me by what you were not what you are i know it will excuse this sudden execution of my will and so conduct me where from company i may revolve and ruminate my grief",

heaven is hid behind the globe that lights the lower world then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen in murders and in outrage boldly here but when from under this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole then murders treasons and detested sins the cloak of night being plucked from off their backs stand bare and naked trembling at themselves so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke who all this while hath reveled in the night whilst we were wand'ring with the antipodes shall see us rising in our throne the east his treasons will sit blushing in his face not able to endure the sight of day but self affrighted tremble at his sin not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king the breath of worldly men cannot depose the deputy elected by the lord for every man that bolingbroke hath pressed to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown god for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel then if angels fight weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right welcome my lord how far off lies your power but now the blood of twenty thousand men did triumph in my face and they are fled and till so much blood thither come again have i not reason to look pale and dead all souls that will be safe fly from my side for time hath set a blot upon my pride i had forgot myself am i not king awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest is not the king's name twenty thousand names arm arm my name a puny subject strikes at thy great glory look not to the ground you favorites of a king are we not high high be our thoughts i know my uncle york hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here mine ear is open and my heart prepared the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold say is my kingdom lost why 'twas my care and what loss is it to be rid of care strives bolingbroke to be as great as we greater he shall not be if he serve god we'll serve him too and be his fellow so revolt our subjects that we cannot mend they break their faith to god as well as us cry woe destruction ruin and decay the worst is death and death will have his day too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot what is become of bushy where is green that they have let the dangerous enemy measure our confines with such peaceful steps if we prevail their heads shall pay for it i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke o villains vipers damned without redemption dogs easily won to fawn on any man snakes in my heart blood warmed that sting my heart three judases each one thrice worse than judas would they make peace terrible hell make war upon their spotted souls for this no matter where of comfort no man speak let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth let's choose executors and talk of wills and yet not so for what can we bequeath save our depos\u00e8d bodies to the ground our lands our lives and all are bolingbroke's and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our bones for god's sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings  how some have been deposed some slain in war some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed some poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed all murdered for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp allowing him a breath a little scene to monarchize be feared and kill with looks infusing him with self and vain conceit as if this flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable and humored thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castle wall and farewell king cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence throw away respect tradition form and ceremonious duty for you have but mistook me all this while i live with bread like you feel want taste grief need friends subjected thus how can you say to me i am a king thou chid'st me well proud bolingbroke i come to change blows with thee for our day of doom  this ague fit of fear is overblown an easy task it is to win our own  say scroop where lies our uncle with his power speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour thou hast said enough beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth of that sweet way i was in to despair what say you now what comfort have we now by heaven i'll hate him everlastingly that bids me be of comfort anymore go to flint castle there i'll pine away a king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey that power i have discharge and let them go to ear the land that hath some hope to grow for i have none let no man speak again to alter this for counsel is but vain he does me double wrong that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue discharge my followers let them hence away from richard's night to bolingbroke's fair day we are amazed and thus long have we stood to watch the fearful bending of thy knee because we thought ourself thy lawful king an if we be how dare thy joints forget to pay their awful duty to our presence if we be not show us the hand of god that hath dismissed us from our stewardship for well we know no hand of blood and bone can gripe the sacred handle of our scepter unless he do profane steal or usurp and though you think that all as you have done have torn their souls by turning them from us and we are barren and bereft of friends yet know my master god omnipotent is mustering in his clouds on our behalf armies of pestilence and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of my precious crown tell bolingbroke for yon methinks he stands  that every stride he makes upon my land is dangerous treason he is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war but ere the crown he looks for live in peace ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons shall ill become the flower of england's face change the complexion of her maid pale peace to scarlet indignation and bedew her pastures' grass with faithful english blood northumberland say thus the king returns his noble cousin is right welcome hither and all the number of his fair demands shall be accomplished without contradiction with all the gracious utterance thou hast speak to his gentle hearing kind commends we do debase ourselves cousin do we not to look so poorly and to speak so fair shall we call back northumberland and send defiance to the traitor and so die o god o god that e'er this tongue of mine that laid the sentence of dread banishment on yon proud man should take it off again with words of sooth o that i were as great as is my grief or lesser than my name or that i could forget what i have been or not remember what i must be now swell'st

thou weep'st my tender hearted cousin we'll make foul weather with despis\u00e8d tears our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn and make a dearth in this revolting land or shall we play the wantons with our woes and make some pretty match with shedding tears as thus to drop them still upon one place till they have fretted us a pair of graves within the earth and therein laid there lies

that nothing have with nothing grieved and thou with all pleased that hast all achieved long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit and soon lie richard in an earthy pit god save king henry unkinged richard says and send him many years of sunshine days what more remains must i do so and must i ravel out my weaved up follies gentle northumberland if thy offenses were upon record would it not shame thee in so fair a troop to read a lecture of them if thou wouldst there shouldst thou find one heinous article containing the deposing of a king and cracking the strong warrant of an oath marked with a blot damned in the book of heaven  nay all of you that stand and look upon me whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself though some of you with pilate wash your hands showing an outward pity yet you pilates have here delivered me to my sour cross and water cannot wash away your sin mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see and yet salt water blinds them not so much but they can see a sort of traitors here nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself i find myself a traitor with the rest for i have given here my soul's consent t' undeck the pompous body of a king made glory base and sovereignty a slave proud majesty a subject state a peasant no lord of thine thou haught insulting man nor no man's lord i have no name no title no not that name was given me at the font but 'tis usurped alack the heavy day that i have worn so many winters out and know not now what name to call myself o that i were a mockery king of snow standing before the sun of bolingbroke to melt myself away in water drops  good king great king and yet not greatly good an if my word be sterling yet in england let it command a mirror hither straight that it may show me what a face i have since it is bankrupt of his majesty fiend thou torments me ere i come to hell they shall be satisfied i'll read enough when i do see the very book indeed where all my sins are writ and that's myself give me that glass and therein will i read no deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck so many blows upon this face of mine and made no deeper wounds o flatt'ring glass like to my followers in prosperity thou dost beguile me was this face the face that every day under his household roof did keep ten thousand men was this the face that like the sun did make beholders wink is this the face which faced so many follies that was at last outfaced by bolingbroke a brittle glory shineth in this face as brittle as the glory is the face for there it is cracked in an hundred shivers  mark silent king the moral of this sport how soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face say that again the shadow of my sorrow ha let's see 'tis very true my grief lies all within and these external manners of laments are merely shadows to the unseen grief that swells with silence in the tortured soul there lies the substance and i thank thee king for thy great bounty that not only giv'st me cause to wail but teachest me the way how to lament the cause i'll beg one boon and then be gone and trouble you no more shall i obtain it fair cousin i am greater than a king for when i was a king my flatterers were then but subjects being now a subject i have a king here to my flatterer being so great i have no need to beg and shall i have then give me leave to go whither you will so i were from your sights o good convey conveyers are you all that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall join not with grief fair woman do not so to make my end too sudden learn good soul to think our former state a happy dream from which awaked the truth of what we are shows us but this i am sworn brother sweet to grim necessity and he and i will keep a league till death hie thee to france and cloister thee in some religious house our holy lives must win a new world's crown which our profane hours here have thrown down a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts i had been still a happy king of men good sometime queen prepare thee hence for france think i am dead and that even here thou takest as from my deathbed thy last living leave in winter's tedious nights sit by the fire with good old folks and let them tell thee tales of woeful ages long ago betid and ere thou bid good night to quite their griefs tell thou the lamentable tale of me and send the hearers weeping to their beds forwhy the senseless brands will sympathize the heavy accent of thy moving tongue and in compassion weep the fire out and some will mourn in ashes some coal black for the deposing of a rightful king northumberland thou ladder wherewithal the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne the time shall not be many hours of age more than it is ere foul sin gathering head shall break into corruption thou shalt think though he divide the realm and give thee half it is too little helping him to all he shall think that thou which knowest the way to plant unrightful kings wilt know again being ne'er so little urged another way to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne the love of wicked men converts to fear that fear to hate and hate turns one or both to worthy danger and deserv\u00e8d death doubly divorced bad men you violate a twofold marriage twixt my crown and me and then betwixt me and my married wife let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me and yet not so for with a kiss 'twas made  part us northumberland i towards the north where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime my wife to france from whence set forth in pomp she came adorn\u00e8d hither like sweet may sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart so two together weeping make one woe weep thou for me in france i for thee here better far off than near be ne'er the near go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans twice for one step i'll groan the way being short and piece the way out with a heavy heart come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief since wedding it there is such length in grief one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart we make woe wanton with this fond delay once more adieu the rest let sorrow say i have been studying how i may compare this prison where i live unto the world and for because the world is populous and here is not a creature but myself i cannot do it yet i'll hammer it out my brain i'll prove the female to my soul my soul the father and these two beget a generation of still breeding thoughts and these same thoughts people this little world in humors like the people of this world for no thought is contented the better sort as thoughts of things divine are intermixed with scruples and do set the word itself against the word as thus come little ones and then again it is as hard to come as for a camel to thread the postern of a small needle's eye thoughts tending to ambition they do plot unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails may tear a passage through the flinty ribs of this hard world my ragged prison walls and for they cannot die in their own pride thoughts tending to content flatter themselves that they are not the first of fortune's slaves nor shall not be the last like silly beggars who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame that many have and others must sit there and in this thought they find a kind of ease bearing their own misfortunes on the back of such as have before endured the like thus play i in one person many people and none contented sometimes am i king then treasons make me wish myself a beggar and so i am then crushing penury persuades me i was better when a king then am i kinged again and by and by think that i am unkinged by bolingbroke and straight am nothing but whate'er i be nor i nor any man that but man is with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased with being nothing music do i hear ha ha keep time how sour sweet music is when time is broke and no proportion kept so is it in the music of men's lives and here have i the daintiness of ear to check time broke in a disordered string but for the concord of my state and time had not an ear to hear my true time broke i wasted time and now doth time waste me for now hath time made me his numb'ring clock my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch whereto my finger like a dial's point is pointing still in cleansing them from tears now sir the sound that tells what hour it is are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans show minutes times and hours but my time runs posting on in bolingbroke's proud joy while i stand fooling here his jack of the clock this music mads me let it sound no more for though it have holp madmen to their wits in me it seems it will make wise men mad yet blessing on his heart that gives it me for 'tis a sign of love and love to richard is a strange brooch in this all hating world thanks noble peer the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear what art thou and how comest thou hither where no man never comes but that sad dog that brings me food to make misfortune live rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend how went he under him so proud that bolingbroke was on his back that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand this hand hath made him proud with clapping him would he not stumble would he not fall down since pride must have a fall and break the neck of that proud man that did usurp his back forgiveness horse why do i rail on thee since thou created to be awed by man wast born to bear i was not made a horse and yet i bear a burden like an ass spurred galled and tired by jauncing bolingbroke if thou love me 'tis time thou wert away taste of it first as thou art wont to do the devil take henry of lancaster and thee patience is stale and i am weary of it how now what means death in this rude assault villain thy own hand yields thy death's instrument go thou and fill another room in hell that hand shall burn in never quenching fire that staggers thus my person exton thy fierce hand hath with the king's blood stained the king's own land mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die", "H8_Wolsey":

not like yourself who ever yet have stood to charity and displayed th' effects of disposition gentle and of wisdom o'ertopping woman's power madam you do me wrong i have no spleen against you nor injustice for you or any how far i have proceeded or how far further shall is warranted by a commission from the consistory yea the whole consistory of rome you charge me that i have blown this coal i do deny it the king is present if it be known to him that i gainsay my deed how may he wound and worthily my falsehood yea as much as you have done my truth if he know that i am free of your report he knows i am not of your wrong therefore in him it lies to cure me and the cure is to remove these thoughts from you the which before his highness shall speak in i do beseech you gracious madam to unthink your speaking and to say so no more most gracious sir in humblest manner i require your highness that it shall please you to declare in hearing of all these ears for where i am robbed and bound there must i be unloosed although not there at once and fully satisfied whether ever i did broach this business to your highness or laid any scruple in your way which might induce you to the question on 't or ever have to you but with thanks to god for such a royal lady spake one the least word that might be to the prejudice of her present state or touch of her good person peace to your

sorry my integrity should breed  and service to his majesty and you  so deep suspicion where all faith was meant we come not by the way of accusation to taint that honor every good tongue blesses nor to betray you any way to sorrow  you have too much good lady but to know how you stand minded in the weighty difference between the king and you and to deliver like free and honest men our just opinions and comforts to your cause madam you wrong the king's love with these fears your hopes and friends are infinite he tells you rightly madam this is a mere distraction you turn the good we offer into envy madam you wander from the good we aim at pray hear me if your grace could but be brought to know our ends are honest you'd feel more comfort why should we good lady upon what cause wrong you alas our places the way of our profession is against it we are to cure such sorrows not to sow 'em for goodness' sake consider what you do how you may hurt yourself ay utterly grow from the king's acquaintance by this carriage the hearts of princes kiss obedience so much they love it but to stubborn spirits they swell and grow as terrible as storms i know you have a gentle noble temper a soul as even as a calm pray think us those we profess peacemakers friends and servants the packet cromwell gave 't you the king looked he o' th' inside of the paper is he ready to come abroad leave me awhile it shall be to the duchess of alen\u00e7on the french king's sister he shall marry her anne bullen no i'll no anne bullens for him there's more in 't than fair visage bullen no we'll no bullens speedily i wish to hear from rome the marchioness of pembroke the late queen's gentlewoman a knight's daughter to be her mistress' mistress the queen's queen this candle burns not clear 'tis i must snuff it then out it goes what though i know her virtuous and well deserving yet i know her for a spleeny lutheran and not wholesome to our cause that she should lie i' th' bosom of our hard ruled king again there is sprung up an heretic an arch one cranmer one hath crawled into the favor of the king and is his oracle heaven forgive me ever god bless your highness sir for holy offices i have a time a time to think upon the part of business which i bear i' th' state and nature does require her times of preservation which perforce i her frail son amongst my brethren mortal must give my tendance to and ever may your highness yoke together as i will lend you cause my doing well with my well saying what should this mean my sovereign i confess your royal graces showered on me daily have been more than could my studied purposes requite which went beyond all man's endeavors my endeavors have ever come too short of my desires yet filed with my abilities mine own ends have been mine so that evermore they pointed to th' good of your most sacred person and the profit of the state for your great graces heaped upon me poor undeserver i can nothing render but allegiant thanks my prayers to heaven for you my loyalty which ever has and ever shall be growing till death that winter kill it i do profess that for your highness' good i ever labored more than mine own that am have and will be  though all the world should crack their duty to you and throw it from their soul though perils did abound as thick as thought could make 'em and appear in forms more horrid yet my duty as doth a rock against the chiding flood should the approach of this wild river break and stand unshaken yours what should this mean what sudden anger's this how have i reaped it he parted frowning from me as if ruin leaped from his eyes so looks the chaf\u00e8d lion upon the daring huntsman that has galled him then makes him nothing i must read this paper  i fear the story of his anger 'tis so this paper has undone me 'tis th' accompt of all that world of wealth i have drawn together for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom and fee my friends in rome o negligence fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil made me put this main secret in the packet i sent the king is there no way to cure this no new device to beat this from his brains i know 'twill stir him strongly yet i know a way if it take right in spite of fortune will bring me off again what's this to th' pope the letter as i live with all the business i writ to 's holiness nay then farewell i have touched the highest point of all my greatness and from that full meridian of my glory i haste now to my setting i shall fall like a bright exhalation in the evening and no man see me more stay where's your commission lords words cannot carry authority so weighty till i find more than will or words to do it  i mean your malice know officious lords i dare and must deny it now i feel of what coarse metal you are molded envy how eagerly you follow my disgraces as if it fed you and how sleek and wanton you appear in everything may bring my ruin follow your envious courses men of malice you have christian warrant for 'em and no doubt in time will find their fit rewards that seal you ask with such a violence the king mine and your master with his own hand gave me bade me enjoy it with the place and honors during my life and to confirm his goodness tied it by letters patents now who'll take it it must be himself then proud lord thou liest within these forty hours surrey durst better have burnt that tongue than said so this and all else this talking lord can lay upon my credit i answer is most false the duke by law found his deserts how innocent i was from any private malice in his end his noble jury and foul cause can witness  if i loved many words lord i should tell you you have as little honesty as honor that in the way of loyalty and truth toward the king my ever royal master dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be and all that love his follies all goodness is poison to thy stomach how much methinks i could despise this man but that i am bound in charity against it so much fairer and spotless shall mine innocence arise when the king knows my truth speak on sir i dare your worst objections if i blush it is to see a nobleman want manners so farewell to the little good you bear me farewell a long farewell to all my greatness this is the state of man today he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honors thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is a ripening nips his root and then he falls as i do i have ventured like little wanton boys that swim on bladders this many summers in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth my high blown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must forever hide me vain pomp and glory of this world i hate you i feel my heart new opened o how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin more pangs and fears than wars or women have and when he falls he falls like lucifer never to hope again why how now cromwell what amazed at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline nay an you weep i am fall'n indeed why well never so truly happy my good cromwell i know myself now and i feel within me a peace above all earthly dignities a still and quiet conscience the king has cured me  i humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders these ruined pillars out of pity taken a load would sink a navy too much honor o 'tis a burden cromwell 'tis a burden too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven i hope i have i am able now methinks out of a fortitude of soul i feel to endure more miseries and greater far than my weak hearted enemies dare offer what news abroad god bless him that's somewhat sudden but he's a learn\u00e8d man may he continue long in his highness' favor and do justice for truth's sake and his conscience that his bones when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings may have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on him what more that's news indeed there was the weight that pulled me down o cromwell the king has gone beyond me all my glories in that one woman i have lost forever no sun shall ever usher forth mine honors or gild again the noble troops that waited upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell i am a poor fall'n man unworthy now to be thy lord and master seek the king that sun i pray may never set i have told him what and how true thou art he will advance thee some little memory of me will stir him  i know his noble nature not to let thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell neglect him not make use now and provide for thine own future safety cromwell i did not think to shed a tear in all my miseries but thou hast forced me out of thy honest truth to play the woman let's dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell and when i am forgotten as i shall be and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention of me more must be heard of say i taught thee say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory and sounded all the depths and shoals of honor found thee a way out of his wrack to rise in a sure and safe one though thy master missed it mark but my fall and that that ruined me cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition by that sin fell the angels how can man then the image of his maker hope to win by it love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee corruption wins not more than honesty still in thy right hand carry gentle peace to silence envious tongues be just and fear not let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's thy god's and truth's then if thou fall'st o cromwell thou fall'st a bless\u00e8d martyr serve the king and prithee lead me in there take an inventory of all i have to the last penny 'tis the king's my robe and my integrity to heaven is all i dare now call mine own o cromwell cromwell had i but served my god with half the zeal i served my king he would not in mine age have left me naked to mine enemies so i have farewell the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell", "JC_Brutus": "a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march not i i am not gamesome i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony let me not hinder cassius your desires i'll leave you cassius be not deceived if i have veiled my look i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself vex\u00e8d i am of late with passions of some difference conceptions only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors but let not therefore my good friends be grieved among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutus with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men no cassius for the eye sees not itself but by reflection by some other things into what dangers would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me what means this shouting i do fear the people choose caesar for their king i would not cassius yet i love him well but wherefore do you hold me here so long what is it that you would impart to me if it be aught toward the general good set honor in one eye and death i' th' other and i will look on both indifferently for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honor more than i fear death another general shout i do believe that these applauses are for some new honors that are heaped on caesar that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further moved what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things till then my noble friend chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us the games are done and caesar is returning i will do so but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesar's brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calphurnia's cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being crossed in conference by some senators ay casca tell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad i should not then ask casca what had chanced what was the second noise for was the crown offered him thrice tell us the manner of it gentle casca 'tis very like he hath the falling sickness what said he when he came unto himself and after that he came thus sad away what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school and so it is for this time i will leave you tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you what lucius ho  i cannot by the progress of the stars give guess how near to day lucius i say  i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly  when lucius when awake i say what lucius get me a taper in my study lucius when it is lighted come and call me here it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general he would be crowned how that might change his nature there's the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking crown him that and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with th' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections swayed more than his reason but 'tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambition's ladder whereto the climber upward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpent's egg which hatched would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell get you to bed again it is not day is not tomorrow boy the ides of march look in the calendar and bring me word the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself shall rome etc speak strike redress brutus thou sleep'st awake such instigations have been often dropped where i have took them up shall rome etc thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one man's awe what rome my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was called a king speak strike redress am i entreated to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus 'tis good go to the gate somebody knocks since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection is he alone do you know them let 'em enter they are the faction o conspiracy sham'st thou to show thy dang'rous brow by night when evils are most free o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention i have been up this hour awake all night know i these men that come along with you he is welcome hither he is welcome too they are all welcome what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night give me your hands all over one by one no not an oath if not the face of men the sufferance of our souls the time's abuse  if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let high sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery but if these  as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valor the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath passed from him o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow anything that other men begin our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar let's be sacrificers but not butchers caius we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesar's spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide 'em this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be called purgers not murderers and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesar's arm when caesar's head is off alas good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wildness and much company peace count the clock by the eighth hour is that the uttermost now good metellus go along by him he loves me well and i have given him reasons send him but hither and i'll fashion him good gentlemen look fresh and merrily let not our looks put on our purposes but bear it as our roman actors do with untired spirits and formal constancy and so good morrow to you every one boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber thou hast no figures nor no fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men therefore thou sleep'st so sound portia what mean you wherefore rise you now it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning i am not well in health and that is all why so i do good portia go to bed kneel not gentle portia you are my true and honorable wife as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart o you gods render me worthy of this noble wife hark hark one knocks portia go in awhile and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart all my engagements i will construe to thee all the charactery of my sad brows leave me with haste lucius who 's that knocks caius ligarius that metellus spoke of  boy stand aside caius ligarius how o what a time have you chose out brave caius to wear a kerchief would you were not sick such an exploit have i in hand ligarius had you a healthful ear to hear of it a piece of work that will make sick men whole that must we also what it is my caius i shall unfold to thee as we are going to whom it must be done follow me then caesar 'tis strucken eight that every like is not the same o caesar the heart of brutus earns to think upon what said popilius lena look how he makes to caesar mark him cassius be constant popilius lena speaks not of our purposes for look he smiles and caesar doth not change he is addressed press near and second him i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal people and senators be not affrighted fly not stand still ambition's debt is paid where's publius talk not of standing publius good cheer there is no harm intended to your person nor to no roman else so tell them publius do so and let no man abide this deed but we the doers fates we will know your pleasures that we shall die we know 'tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon grant that and then is death a benefit so are we caesar's friends that have abridged his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop and let us bathe our hands in caesar's blood up to the elbows and besmear our swords then walk we forth even to the marketplace and waving our red weapons o'er our heads let's all cry peace freedom and liberty how many times shall caesar bleed in sport that now on pompey's basis lies along no worthier than the dust soft who comes here a friend of antony's thy master is a wise and valiant roman i never thought him worse tell him so please him come unto this place he shall be satisfied and by my honor depart untouched i know that we shall have him well to friend but here comes antony welcome mark antony o antony beg not your death of us though now we must appear bloody and cruel as by our hands and this our present act you see we do yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done our hearts you see not they are pitiful and pity to the general wrong of rome as fire drives out fire so pity pity hath done this deed on caesar for your part to you our swords have leaden points mark antony our arms in strength of malice and our hearts of brothers' temper do receive you in with all kind love good thoughts and reverence only be patient till we have appeased the multitude beside themselves with fear and then we will deliver you the cause why i that did love caesar when i struck him have thus proceeded or else were this a savage spectacle our reasons are so full of good regard that were you antony the son of caesar you should be satisfied you shall mark antony by your pardon i will myself into the pulpit first and show the reason of our caesar's death what antony shall speak i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies it shall advantage more than do us wrong mark antony here take you caesar's body you shall not in your funeral speech blame us but speak all good you can devise of caesar and say you do 't by our permission else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going after my speech is ended prepare the body then and follow us then follow me and give me audience friends  cassius go you into the other street and part the numbers  those that will hear me speak let 'em stay here those that will follow cassius go with him and public reasons shall be render\u00e8d of caesar's death be patient till the last romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear believe me for mine honor and have respect to mine honor that you may believe censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of caesar's to him i say that brutus' love to caesar was no less than his if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer not that i loved caesar less but that i loved rome more had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live all freemen as caesar loved me i weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was valiant i honor him but as he was ambitious i slew him there is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor and death for his ambition who is here so base that would be a bondman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so rude that would not be a roman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so vile that will not love his country if any speak for him have i offended i pause for a reply then none have i offended i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death here comes his body mourned by mark antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not with this i depart that as i slew my best lover for the good of rome i have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death my countrymen  good countrymen let me depart alone and for my sake stay here with antony do grace to caesar's corpse and grace his speech tending to caesar's glories which mark antony by our permission is allowed to make i do entreat you not a man depart save i alone till antony have spoke stand ho what now lucilius is cassius near he greets me well your master pindarus in his own change or by ill officers hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done undone but if he be at hand i shall be satisfied he is not doubted a word lucilius how he received you let me be resolved thou hast described a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius when love begins to sicken and decay it useth an enforc\u00e8d ceremony there are no tricks in plain and simple faith but hollow men like horses hot at hand make gallant show and promise of their mettle but when they should endure the bloody spur they fall their crests and like deceitful jades sink in the trial comes his army on hark he is arrived march gently on to meet him stand ho speak the word along judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies and if not so how should i wrong a brother cassius be content speak your griefs softly i do know you well before the eyes of both our armies here which should perceive nothing but love from us let us not wrangle bid them move away then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs and i will give you audience lucius do you the like and let no man come to our tent till we have done our conference let lucilius and titinius guard our door you wronged yourself to write in such a case let me tell you cassius you yourself are much condemned to have an itching palm to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers the name of cassius honors this corruption and chastisement doth therefore hide his head remember march the ides of march remember did not great julius bleed for justice' sake what villain touched his body that did stab and not for justice what shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes and sell the mighty space of our large honors for so much trash as may be grasp\u00e8d thus i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a roman go to you are not cassius i say you are not away slight man hear me for i will speak must i give way and room to your rash choler shall i be frighted when a madman stares all this ay more fret till your proud heart break go show your slaves how choleric you are and make your bondmen tremble must i budge must i observe you must i stand and crouch under your testy humor by the gods you shall digest the venom of your spleen though it do split you for from this day forth i'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter when you are waspish you say you are a better soldier let it appear so make your vaunting true and it shall please me well for mine own part i shall be glad to learn of noble men if you did i care not peace peace you durst not so have tempted him no for your life you durst not you have done that you should be sorry for there is no terror cassius in your threats for i am armed so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind which i respect not i did send to you for certain sums of gold which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means by heaven i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection i did send to you for gold to pay my legions which you denied me was that done like cassius should i have answered caius cassius so when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends be ready gods with all your thunderbolts dash him to pieces you did i do not till you practice them on me i do not like your faults a flatterer's would not though they do appear as huge as high olympus sheathe your dagger be angry when you will it shall have scope do what you will dishonor shall be humor o cassius you are yok\u00e8d with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire who much enforc\u00e8d shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again when i spoke that i was ill tempered too and my heart too what's the matter yes cassius and from henceforth when you are over earnest with your brutus he'll think your mother chides and leave you so get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence i'll know his humor when he knows his time what should the wars do with these jigging fools  companion hence lucilius and titinius bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight lucius a bowl of wine o cassius i am sick of many griefs no man bears sorrow better portia is dead she is dead impatient of my absence and grief that young octavius with mark antony have made themselves so strong for with her death that tidings came with this she fell distract and her attendants absent swallowed fire even so speak no more of her give me a bowl of wine  in this i bury all unkindness cassius come in titinius welcome good messala now sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities no more i pray you  messala i have here receiv\u00e8d letters that young octavius and mark antony come down upon us with a mighty power bending their expedition toward philippi with what addition therein our letters do not well agree mine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions cicero being one no messala nothing messala why ask you hear you aught of her in yours now as you are a roman tell me true why farewell portia we must die messala with meditating that she must die once i have the patience to endure it now well to our work alive what do you think of marching to philippi presently your reason good reasons must of force give place to better the people 'twixt philippi and this ground do stand but in a forced affection for they have grudged us contribution the enemy marching along by them by them shall make a fuller number up come on refreshed new added and encouraged from which advantage shall we cut him off if at philippi we do face him there these people at our back under your pardon you must note besides that we have tried the utmost of our friends our legions are brim full our cause is ripe the enemy increaseth every day we at the height are ready to decline there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures the deep of night is crept upon our talk and nature must obey necessity which we will niggard with a little rest there is no more to say lucius my gown farewell good messala  good night titinius noble noble cassius good night and good repose everything is well good night good brother farewell everyone give me the gown where is thy instrument what thou speak'st drowsily poor knave i blame thee not thou art o'erwatched call claudius and some other of my men i'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent i pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep it may be i shall raise you by and by on business to my brother cassius i will not have it so lie down good sirs it may be i shall otherwise bethink me look lucius here's the book i sought for so i put it in the pocket of my gown bear with me good boy i am much forgetful canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile and touch thy instrument a strain or two it does my boy i trouble thee too much but thou art willing i should not urge thy duty past thy might i know young bloods look for a time of rest it was well done and thou shalt sleep again i will not hold thee long if i do live i will be good to thee this is a sleepy tune o murd'rous slumber layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy that plays thee music gentle knave good night i will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee if thou dost nod thou break'st thy instrument i'll take it from thee and good boy good night let me see let me see is not the leaf turned down where i left reading here it is i think how ill this taper burns ha who comes here  i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition it comes upon me art thou any thing art thou some god some angel or some devil that mak'st my blood cold and my hair to stare speak to me what thou art why com'st thou well then i shall see thee again why i will see thee at philippi then now i have taken heart thou vanishest ill spirit i would hold more talk with thee  boy lucius varro claudius sirs awake claudius he thinks he still is at his instrument lucius awake didst thou dream lucius that thou so criedst out yes that thou didst didst thou see anything sleep again lucius sirrah claudius fellow thou awake why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep ay saw you anything go and commend me to my brother cassius bid him set on his powers betimes before and we will follow they stand and would have parley words before blows is it so countrymen good words are better than bad strokes octavius o yes and soundless too for you have stolen their buzzing antony and very wisely threat before you sting caesar thou canst not die by traitors' hands unless thou bring'st them with thee o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain young man thou couldst not die more honorable ho lucilius hark a word with you even so lucilius even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below no cassius no think not thou noble roman that ever brutus will go bound to rome he bears too great a mind but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun and whether we shall meet again i know not therefore our everlasting farewell take forever and forever farewell cassius if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made why then lead on o that a man might know the end of this day's business ere it come but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known come ho away ride ride messala ride and give these bills unto the legions on the other side let them set on at once for i perceive but cold demeanor in octavius' wing and sudden push gives them the overthrow ride ride messala let them all come down where where messala doth his body lie titinius' face is upward o julius caesar thou art mighty yet thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords in our own proper entrails are yet two romans living such as these  the last of all the romans fare thee well it is impossible that ever rome should breed thy fellow friends i owe more tears to this dead man than you shall see me pay  i shall find time cassius i shall find time  come therefore and to thasos send his body his funerals shall not be in our camp lest it discomfort us lucilius come  and come young cato let us to the field  labeo and flavius set our battles on 'tis three o'clock and romans yet ere night we shall try fortune in a second fight yet countrymen o yet

asleep farewell to thee too strato countrymen my heart doth joy that yet in all my life i found no man but he was true to me i shall have glory by this losing day more than octavius and mark antony by

this hour hence i will follow i prithee strato stay thou by thy lord thou art a fellow of a good respect thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it hold then my sword and turn away thy face while i

coach and overlooks the highest peering hills so tamora upon her wit doth earthly honor wait and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown then aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress and mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long hast prisoner held fettered in amorous chains and faster bound to aaron's charming eyes than is prometheus tied to caucasus away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts i will be bright and shine in pearl and gold to wait upon this new made emperess to wait said i to wanton with this queen this goddess this semiramis this nymph this siren that will charm rome's saturnine and see his shipwrack and his commonweal's holla what storm is this clubs clubs these lovers will not keep the peace why how now lords so near the emperor's palace dare you draw and maintain such a quarrel openly full well i wot the ground of all this grudge i would not for a million of gold the cause were known to them it most concerns nor would your noble mother for much more be so dishonored in the court of rome for shame put up away i say now by the gods that warlike goths adore this petty brabble will undo us all why lords and think you not how dangerous it is to jet upon a prince's right what is lavinia then become so loose or bassianus so degenerate that for her love such quarrels may be broached without controlment justice or revenge young lords beware and should the empress know this discord's ground the music would not please why are you mad or know you not in rome how furious and impatient they be and cannot brook competitors in love i tell you lords you do but plot your deaths by this device to achieve her how ay and as good as saturninus may why then it seems some certain snatch or so would serve your turns would you had hit it too then should not we be tired with this ado why hark you hark you and are you such fools to square for this would it offend you then that both should speed for shame be friends and join for that you jar 'tis policy and stratagem must do that you affect and so must you resolve that what you cannot as you would achieve you must perforce accomplish as you may take this of me lucrece was not more chaste than this lavinia bassianus' love a speedier course than ling'ring languishment must we pursue and i have found the path my lords a solemn hunting is in hand there will the lovely roman ladies troop the forest walks are wide and spacious and many unfrequented plots there are fitted by kind for rape and villainy single you thither then this dainty doe and strike her home by force if not by words this way or not at all stand you in hope come come our empress with her sacred wit to villainy and vengeance consecrate will we acquaint withal what we intend and she shall file our engines with advice that will not suffer you to square yourselves but to your wishes' height advance you both the emperor's court is like the house of fame the palace full of tongues of eyes and ears the woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull there speak and strike brave boys and take your turns there serve your lust shadowed from heaven's eye and revel in lavinia's treasury he that had wit would think that i had none to bury so much gold under a tree and never after to inherit it let him that thinks of me so abjectly know that this gold must coin a stratagem which cunningly effected will beget a very excellent piece of villainy and so repose sweet gold for their unrest that have their alms out of the empress' chest madam though venus govern your desires saturn is dominator over mine what signifies my deadly standing eye my silence and my cloudy melancholy my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls even as an adder when she doth unroll to do some fatal execution

thee this is the day of doom for bassianus his philomel must lose her tongue today thy sons make pillage of her chastity and wash their hands in bassianus' blood seest thou this letter take it up i pray thee and give the king this fatal plotted scroll now question me no more we are espied here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty which dreads not yet their lives' destruction no more great empress bassianus comes be cross with him and i'll go fetch thy sons to back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they be come on my lords the better foot before straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit where i espied the panther fast asleep now will i fetch the king to find them here that he thereby may have a likely guess how these were they that made away his brother my gracious lord here is the bag of gold titus andronicus my lord the emperor sends thee this word that if thou love thy sons let marcus lucius or thyself old titus or any one of you chop off your hand and send it to the king he for the same will send thee hither both thy sons alive and that shall be the ransom for their fault nay come agree whose hand shall go along for fear they die before their pardon come if that be called deceit i will be honest and never whilst i live deceive men so but i'll deceive you in another sort and that you'll say ere half an hour pass i go andronicus and for thy hand look by and by to have thy sons with thee their heads i mean o how this villainy doth fat me with the very thoughts of it let fools do good and fair men call for grace aaron will have his soul black like his face ay some mad message from his mad grandfather ay just a verse in horace right you have it now what a thing it is to be an ass here's no sound jest the old man hath found their guilt and sends them weapons wrapped about with lines that wound beyond their feeling to the quick but were our witty empress well afoot she would applaud andronicus' conceit but let her rest in her unrest awhile  and now young lords was 't not a happy star led us to rome strangers and more than so captives to be advanc\u00e8d to this height it did me good before the palace gate to brave the tribune in his brother's hearing had he not

better than another hue in that it scorns to bear another hue for all the water in the ocean can never turn the swan's black legs to white although she lave them hourly in the flood tell the empress from me i am of age to keep mine own excuse it how she can my mistress is my mistress this myself the vigor and the picture of my youth this before all the world do i prefer this maugre all the world

mother gold and tell them both the circumstance of all and how by this their child shall be advanced and be receiv\u00e8d for the emperor's heir and substituted in the place of mine to calm this tempest whirling in the court and let the emperor dandle him for his own hark you lords you see i have given her physic and you must needs bestow her funeral the fields are near and you are gallant

thou sawest why she was washed and cut and trimmed and 'twas trim sport for them which had the doing of it indeed i was their tutor to instruct them that codding spirit had they from their mother as sure a card as ever won the set that bloody mind i think they learned of me as true a dog as ever fought at head well let my deeds be witness of my worth i trained thy brethren to that guileful hole where the dead corpse of bassianus lay i wrote the letter that thy father found and hid the gold within that letter mentioned confederate with the queen and her two sons and what not done that thou hast cause to rue wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it i played the cheater for thy father's hand and when i had it drew myself apart and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter i pried me through the crevice of a wall when for his hand he had his two sons' heads beheld his tears and laughed so heartily that both mine eyes were rainy like to his and when i told the empress of this sport she sounded almost at my pleasing tale and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses ay like a black dog as the saying is ay that i had not done a thousand more even now i curse the day and yet i think few

deadly enmity between two friends make poor men's cattle break their necks set fire on barns and haystalks in the night and bid the owners quench them with their tears oft have i digged up dead men from their graves and set them upright at their dear friends' door even when their sorrows almost was forgot and on their skins as on the bark of trees have with my knife carv\u00e8d in roman letters let not your sorrow die though i am dead but i have done a thousand dreadful things as willingly as one would kill a fly and nothing grieves me heartily indeed but that i cannot do ten thousand more if there be devils would i were a devil to live and burn in everlasting fire so i might have your company in hell but to torment you with my bitter tongue some devil whisper curses in my ear and prompt me that my tongue may utter forth the venomous malice of my swelling heart ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb i am no baby i that with base prayers i should repent the evils i have done

seek us afterwards in other terms you shall find us in our saltwater girdle if you beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in the adventure our crows shall fare the better for you and there's an end receive it friendly but from this time forth i wear it as your enemy 'tis all the better your valiant britons have their wishes in it that man of hers pisanio her old servant i have not seen these two days 'tis certain she is fled go in and cheer the king he rages none dare come about him i love and hate her for she's fair and royal and that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite than lady ladies woman from every one the best she hath and she of all compounded outsells them all i love her therefore but disdaining me and throwing favors on the low posthumus slanders so her judgment that what's else rare is choked and in that point i will conclude to hate her nay indeed to be revenged upon her for when fools shall who is here what are you packing sirrah come hither ah you precious pander villain where is thy lady in a word or else thou art straightway with the fiends where is thy lady or by jupiter  i will not ask again close villain i'll have this secret from thy heart or rip thy heart to find it is she with posthumus from whose so many weights of baseness cannot a dram of worth be drawn where is she sir come nearer no farther halting satisfy me home what is become of her all worthy villain discover where thy mistress is at once at the next word no more of worthy lord speak or thy silence on the instant is thy condemnation and thy death let's see 't i will pursue her even to augustus' throne humh sirrah is this letter true it is posthumus' hand i know 't sirrah if thou wouldst not be a villain but do me true service undergo those employments wherein i should have cause to use thee with a serious industry  that is what villainy soe'er i bid thee do to perform it directly and truly i would think thee an honest man thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment wilt thou serve me for since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar posthumus thou canst not in the course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of mine wilt thou serve me give me thy hand here's my purse hast any of thy late master's garments in thy possession the first service thou dost me fetch that suit hither let it be thy first service go meet thee at milford haven i forgot to ask him one thing i'll remember 't anon even there thou villain posthumus will i kill thee i would these garments were come she said upon a time  the bitterness of it i now belch from my heart  that she held the very garment of posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person together with the adornment of my qualities with that suit upon my back will i ravish her first kill him and in her eyes there shall she see my valor which will then be a torment to her contempt he on the ground my speech of insultment ended on his dead body and when my lust hath dined which as i say to vex her i will execute in the clothes that she so praised to the court i'll knock her back foot her home again she hath despised me rejoicingly and i'll be merry in my revenge be those the garments how long is 't since she went to milford haven bring this apparel to my chamber that is the second thing that i have commanded thee the third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design be but duteous and true preferment shall tender itself to thee my revenge is now at milford would i had wings to follow it come and be true i am near to th' place where they should meet if pisanio have mapped it truly how fit his garments serve me why should his mistress who was made by him that made the tailor not be fit too the rather saving reverence of the word for 'tis said a woman's fitness comes by fits therein i must play the workman i dare speak it to myself for it is not vainglory for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber i mean the lines of my body are as well drawn as his no less young more strong not beneath him in fortunes beyond him in the advantage of the time above him in birth alike conversant in general services and more remarkable in single oppositions yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite what mortality is posthumus thy head which now is growing upon thy shoulders shall within this hour be off thy mistress enforced thy garments cut to pieces before thy face and all this done spurn her home to her father who may haply be a little angry or my so rough usage but my mother having power of his testiness shall turn all into my commendations my horse is tied up safe out sword and to a sore purpose fortune put them into my hand this is the very description of their meeting place and the fellow dares not deceive me i cannot find those runagates that villain hath mocked me i am faint soft what are you that fly me thus some villain mountaineers i have heard of such what slave art thou thou art a robber a lawbreaker a villain yield thee thief thou villain base know'st me not by my clothes thou precious varlet my tailor made them not thou injurious thief hear but my name and tremble cloten thou villain to thy further fear nay to thy mere confusion thou shalt know i am son to th' queen art not afeard die the death when i have slain thee with my proper hand i'll follow those that even now fled hence and on the gates of lud's town set your heads yield rustic mountaineer", "H5_HenryV": "where is my gracious lord of canterbury send for him good uncle not yet my cousin we would be resolved before we hear him of some things of weight that task our thoughts concerning us and france sure we thank you my learn\u00e8d lord we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salic that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate whose right suits not in native colors with the truth for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to therefore take heed how you impawn our person how you awake our sleeping sword of war we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint 'gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords that makes such waste in brief mortality under this conjuration speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience washed as pure as sin with baptism may i with right and conscience make this claim we must not only arm t' invade the french but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot who will make road upon us with all advantages we do not mean the coursing snatchers only but fear the main intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us for you shall read that my great grandfather never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnished kingdom came pouring like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fullness of his force galling the glean\u00e8d land with hot assays girding with grievous siege castles and towns that england being empty of defense hath shook and trembled at th' ill neighborhood call in the messengers sent from the dauphin now are we well resolved and by god's help and yours the noble sinews of our power france being ours we'll bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces or there we'll sit ruling in large and ample empery o'er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms or lay these bones in an unworthy urn tombless with no remembrance over them either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts or else our grave like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth not worshiped with a waxen epitaph now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear your greeting is from him not from the king we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as is our wretches fettered in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurb\u00e8d plainness tell us the dauphin's mind what treasure uncle we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us his present and your pains we thank you for when we have matched our rackets to these balls we will in france by god's grace play a set shall strike his father's crown into the hazard tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturbed with chases and we understand him well how he comes o'er us with our wilder days not measuring what use we made of them we never valued this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous license as 'tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home but tell the dauphin i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france for that i have laid by my majesty and plodded like a man for working days but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turned his balls to gun stones and his soul shall stand sore charg\u00e8d for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands mock mothers from their sons mock castles down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphin's scorn but this lies all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a well hallowed cause so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savor but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it  convey them with safe conduct fare you well we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furth'rance to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business therefore let our proportions for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings for god before we'll chide this dauphin at his father's door therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought now sits the wind fair and we will aboard  my lord of cambridge and my kind lord of masham and you my gentle knight give me your thoughts think you not that the powers we bear with us will cut their passage through the force of france doing the execution and the act for which we have in head assembled them i doubt not that since we are well persuaded we carry not a heart with us from hence that grows not in a fair consent with ours nor leave not one behind that doth not wish success and conquest to attend on us we therefore have great cause of thankfulness and shall forget the office of our hand sooner than quittance of desert and merit according to the weight and worthiness we judge no less uncle of exeter enlarge the man committed yesterday that railed against our person we consider it was excess of wine that set him on and on his more advice we pardon him o let us yet be merciful alas your too much love and care of me are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch if little faults proceeding on distemper shall not be winked at how shall we stretch our eye when capital crimes chewed swallowed and digested appear before us we'll yet enlarge that man though cambridge scroop and grey in their dear care and tender preservation of our person would have him punished and now to our french causes who are the late commissioners then richard earl of cambridge there is yours  there yours lord scroop of masham and sir knight grey of northumberland this same is yours  read them and know i know your worthiness  my lord of westmoreland and uncle exeter we will aboard tonight why how now gentlemen what see you in those papers that you lose so much complexion look you how they change their cheeks are paper why what read you there that have so cowarded and chased your blood out of appearance the mercy that was quick in us but late by your own counsel is suppressed and killed you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy for your own reasons turn into your bosoms as dogs upon their masters worrying you  see you my princes and my noble peers these english monsters my lord of cambridge here you know how apt our love was to accord to furnish him with all appurtenants belonging to his honor and this man hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired and sworn unto the practices of france to kill us here in hampton to the which this knight no less for bounty bound to us than cambridge is hath likewise sworn but o what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel ingrateful savage and inhuman creature thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels that knew'st the very bottom of my soul that almost mightst have coined me into gold wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use  may it be possible that foreign hire could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger 'tis so strange that though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white my eye will scarcely see it treason and murder ever kept together as two yoke devils sworn to either's purpose working so grossly in a natural cause that admiration did not whoop at them but thou 'gainst all proportion didst bring in wonder to wait on treason and on murder and whatsoever cunning fiend it was that wrought upon thee so preposterously hath got the voice in hell for excellence all other devils that suggest by treasons do botch and bungle up damnation with patches colors and with forms being fetched from glist'ring semblances of piety but he that tempered thee bade thee stand up gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason unless to dub thee with the name of traitor if that same demon that hath gulled thee thus should with his lion gait walk the whole world he might return to vasty tartar back and tell the legions i can never win a soul so easy as that englishman's o how hast thou with jealousy infected the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful why so didst thou seem they grave and learn\u00e8d why so didst thou come they of noble family why so didst thou seem they religious why so didst thou or are they spare in diet free from gross passion or of mirth or anger constant in spirit not swerving with the blood garnished and decked in modest complement not working with the eye without the ear and but in purg\u00e8d judgment trusting neither such and so finely bolted didst thou seem and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot to mark the full fraught man and best endued with some suspicion i will weep for thee for this revolt of thine methinks is like another fall of man their faults are open arrest them to the answer of the law and god acquit them of their practices god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence you have conspired against our royal person joined with an enemy proclaimed and from his coffers received the golden earnest of our death wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter his princes and his peers to servitude his subjects to oppression and contempt and his whole kingdom into desolation touching our person seek we no revenge but we our kingdom's safety must so tender whose ruin you have sought that to her laws we do deliver you get you therefore hence poor miserable wretches to your death the taste whereof god of his mercy give you patience to endure and true repentance of all your dear offenses bear them hence now lords for france the enterprise whereof shall be to you as us like glorious we doubt not of a fair and lucky war since god so graciously hath brought to light this dangerous treason lurking in our way to hinder our beginnings we doubt not now but every rub is smooth\u00e8d on our way then forth dear countrymen let us deliver our puissance into the hand of god putting it straight in expedition cheerly to sea the signs of war advance no king of england if not king of france once more unto the breach dear friends once more or close the wall up with our english dead in peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility but when the blast of war blows in our ears then imitate the action of the tiger stiffen the sinews summon up the blood disguise fair nature with hard favored rage then lend the eye a terrible aspect let it pry through the portage of the head like the brass cannon let the brow o'erwhelm it as fearfully as doth a gall\u00e8d rock o'erhang and jutty his confounded base swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height on on you noblest english whose blood is fet from fathers of war proof fathers that like so many alexanders have in these parts from morn till even fought and sheathed their swords for lack of argument dishonor not your mothers now attest that those whom you called fathers did beget you be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war and you good yeomen whose limbs were made in england show us here the mettle of your pasture let us swear that you are worth your breeding which i doubt not for there is none of you so mean and base that hath not noble luster in your eyes i see you stand like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start the game's afoot follow your spirit and upon this charge cry god for harry england and saint george how yet resolves the governor of the town this is the latest parle we will admit therefore to our best mercy give yourselves or like to men proud of destruction defy us to our worst for as i am a soldier a name that in my thoughts becomes me best if i begin the batt'ry once again i will not leave the half achieved harfleur till in her ashes she lie buri\u00e8d the gates of mercy shall be all shut up and the fleshed soldier rough and hard of heart in liberty of bloody hand shall range with conscience wide as hell mowing like grass your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants what is it then to me if impious war arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends do with his smirched complexion all fell feats enlinked to waste and desolation what is 't to me when you yourselves are cause if your pure maidens fall into the hand of hot and forcing violation what rein can hold licentious wickedness when down the hill he holds his fierce career we may as bootless spend our vain command upon th' enrag\u00e8d soldiers in their spoil as send precepts to the leviathan to come ashore therefore you men of harfleur take pity of your town and of your people whiles yet my soldiers are in my command whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace o'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds of heady murder spoil and villainy if not why in a moment look to see the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand desire the locks of your shrill shrieking daughters your fathers taken by the silver beards and their most reverend heads dashed to the walls your naked infants spitted upon pikes whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry at herod's bloody hunting slaughtermen what say you will you yield and this avoid or guilty in defense be thus destroyed open your gates come uncle exeter go you and enter harfleur there remain and fortify it strongly 'gainst the french use mercy to them all for us dear uncle the winter coming on and sickness growing upon our soldiers we will retire to calais tonight in harfleur will we be your guest tomorrow for the march are we addressed how now fluellen cam'st thou from the bridge what men have you lost fluellen we would have all such offenders so cut off and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages nothing taken but paid for none of the french upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the gentler gamester is the soonest winner well then i know thee what shall i know of thee unfold it what is thy name i know thy quality thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back and tell thy king i do not seek him now but could be willing to march on to calais without impeachment for to say the sooth though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much unto an enemy of craft and vantage my people are with sickness much enfeebled my numbers lessened and those few i have almost no better than so many french who when they were in health i tell thee herald i thought upon one pair of english legs did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god that i do brag thus this your air of france hath blown that vice in me i must repent go therefore tell thy master here i am my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk my army but a weak and sickly guard yet god before tell him we will come on though france himself and such another neighbor stand in our way there's for thy labor montjoy go bid thy master well advise himself if we may pass we will if we be hindered we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolor and so montjoy fare you well the sum of all our answer is but this we would not seek a battle as we are nor as we are we say we will not shun it so tell your master we are in god's hand brother not in theirs march to the bridge it now draws toward night beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves and on tomorrow bid them march away gloucester 'tis true that we are in great danger the greater therefore should our courage be  good morrow brother bedford god almighty there is some soul of goodness in things evil would men observingly distill it out for our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers which is both healthful and good husbandry besides they are our outward consciences and preachers to us all admonishing that we should dress us fairly for our end thus may we gather honey from the weed and make a moral of the devil himself good morrow old sir thomas erpingham a good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of france 'tis good for men to love their present pains upon example so the spirit is eased and when the mind is quickened out of doubt the organs though defunct and dead before break up their drowsy grave and newly move with casted slough and fresh legerity lend me thy cloak sir thomas brothers both commend me to the princes in our camp do my good morrow to them and anon desire them all to my pavilion no my good knight go with my brothers to my lords of england i and my bosom must debate awhile and then i would no other company god a mercy old heart thou speak'st cheerfully a friend i am a gentleman of a company even so what are you then you are a better than the king harry le roy no i am a welshman yes do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yours and his kinsman too i thank you god be with you it sorts well with your fierceness though it appear a little out of fashion there is much care and valor in this welshman a friend under sir thomas erpingham even as men wracked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tide no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds methinks i could not die anywhere so contented as in the king's company his cause being just and his quarrel honorable so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his master's command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servant's damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrament of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is his vengeance so that here men are punished for before breach of the king's laws in now the king's quarrel where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited every subject's duty is the king's but every subject's soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed if i live to see it i will never trust his word after your reproof is something too round i should be angry with you if the time were convenient i embrace it give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it i will make it my quarrel there if ever i live to see it i will challenge it well i will do it though i take thee in the king's company indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no english treason to cut french crowns and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper upon the king let us our lives our souls our debts our careful wives our children and our sins lay on the king we must bear all o hard condition twin born with greatness subject to the breath of every fool whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing what infinite heart's ease must kings neglect that private men enjoy and what have kings that privates have not too save ceremony save general ceremony and what art thou thou idol ceremony what kind of god art thou that suffer'st more of mortal griefs than do thy worshipers what are thy rents what are thy comings in o ceremony show me but thy worth what is thy soul of adoration art thou aught else but place degree and form creating awe and fear in other men wherein thou art less happy being feared than they in fearing what drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet but poisoned flattery o be sick great greatness and bid thy ceremony give thee cure think'st thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation will it give place to flexure and low bending canst thou when thou command'st the beggar's knee command the health of it no thou proud dream that play'st so subtly with a king's repose i am a king that find thee and i know 'tis not the balm the scepter and the ball the sword the mace the crown imperial the intertissued robe of gold and pearl the farc\u00e8d title running 'fore the king the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world no not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony not all these laid in bed majestical can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave who with a body filled and vacant mind gets him to rest crammed with distressful bread never sees horrid night the child of hell but like a lackey from the rise to set sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night sleeps in elysium next day after dawn doth rise and help hyperion to his horse and follows so the ever running year with profitable labor to his grave and but for ceremony such a wretch winding up days with toil and nights with sleep had the forehand and vantage of a king the slave a member of the country's peace enjoys it but in gross brain little wots what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace whose hours the peasant best advantages good old knight collect them all together at my tent i'll be before thee o god of battles steel my soldiers' hearts possess them not with fear take from them now the sense of reck'ning or th' oppos\u00e8d numbers pluck their hearts from them not today o lord o not today think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown i richard's body have interr\u00e8d new and on it have bestowed more contrite tears than from it issued forc\u00e8d drops of blood five hundred poor i have in yearly pay who twice a day their withered hands hold up toward heaven to pardon blood and i have built two chantries where the sad and solemn priests sing still for richard's soul more will i do  though all that i can do is nothing worth since that my penitence comes after all imploring pardon my brother gloucester's voice ay i know thy errand i will go with thee the day my friends and all things stay for me what's he that wishes so my cousin westmoreland no my fair cousin if we are marked to die we are enough to do our country loss and if to live the fewer men the greater share of honor god's will i pray thee wish not one man more by jove i am not covetous for gold nor care i who doth feed upon my cost it yearns me not if men my garments wear such outward things dwell not in my desires but if it be a sin to covet honor i am the most offending soul alive no 'faith my coz wish not a man from england god's peace i would not lose so great an honor as one man more methinks would share from me for the best hope i have o do not wish one more rather proclaim it westmoreland through my host that he which hath no stomach to this fight let him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy put into his purse we would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us this day is called the feast of crispian he that outlives this day and comes safe home will stand o' tiptoe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of crispian he that shall see this day and live old age will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say tomorrow is saint crispian then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars old men forget yet all shall be forgot but he'll remember with advantages what feats he did that day then shall our names familiar in his mouth as household words harry the king bedford and exeter warwick and talbot salisbury and gloucester be in their flowing cups freshly remembered this story shall the good man teach his son and crispin crispian shall ne'er go by from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remember\u00e8d  we few we happy few we band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile this day shall gentle his condition and gentlemen in england now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon saint crispin's day all things are ready if our minds be so thou dost not wish more help from england coz why now thou hast unwished five thousand men which likes me better than to wish us one  you know your places god be with you all who hath sent thee now i pray thee bear my former answer back bid them achieve me and then sell my bones good god why should they mock poor fellows thus the man that once did sell the lion's skin while the beast lived was killed with hunting him a many of our bodies shall no doubt find native graves upon the which i trust shall witness live in brass of this day's work and those that leave their valiant bones in france dying like men though buried in your dunghills they shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them and draw their honors reeking up to heaven leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france mark then abounding valor in our english that being dead like to the bullet's crazing break out into a second course of mischief killing in relapse of mortality let me speak proudly tell the constable we are but warriors for the working day our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched with rainy marching in the painful field there's not a piece of feather in our host  good argument i hope we will not fly  and time hath worn us into slovenry but by the mass our hearts are in the trim and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night they'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck the gay new coats o'er the french soldiers' heads and turn them out of service if they do this as if god please they shall my ransom then will soon be levied herald save thou thy labor come thou no more for ransom gentle herald they shall have none i swear but these my joints which if they have as i will leave 'em them shall yield them little tell the constable i fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom take it brave york now soldiers march away and how thou pleasest god dispose the day well have we done thrice valiant countrymen but all's not done yet keep the french the field lives he good uncle thrice within this hour i saw him down thrice up again and fighting from helmet to the spur all blood he was i blame you not for hearing this i must perforce compound with my full eyes or they will issue too but hark what new alarum is this same the french have reinforced their scattered men then every soldier kill his prisoners give the word through i was not angry since i came to france until this instant take a trumpet herald ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill if they will fight with us bid them come down or void the field they do offend our sight if they'll do neither we will come to them and make them skirr away as swift as stones enforc\u00e8d from the old assyrian slings besides we'll cut the throats of those we have and not a man of them that we shall take shall taste our mercy go and tell them so how now what means this herald know'st thou not that i have fined these bones of mine for ransom com'st thou again for ransom i tell thee truly herald i know not if the day be ours or no for yet a many of your horsemen peer and gallop o'er the field praised be god and not our strength for it what is this castle called that stands hard by then call we this the field of agincourt fought on the day of crispin crispianus they did fluellen i wear it for a memorable honor for i am welsh you know good countryman thanks good my countryman god keep me so our heralds go with him bring me just notice of the numbers dead on both our parts call yonder fellow hither soldier why wear'st thou that glove in thy cap an englishman what think you captain fluellen is it fit this soldier keep his oath it may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort quite from the answer of his degree then keep thy

brother france and to our sister health and fair time of day joy and good wishes to our most fair and princely cousin katherine  and as a branch and member of this royalty by whom this great assembly is contrived we do salute you duke of burgundy  and princes french and peers health to you all to cry amen to that thus we appear if duke of burgundy you would the peace whose want gives growth to th' imperfections which you have cited you must buy that peace with full accord to all our just demands whose tenors and particular effects you have enscheduled briefly in your hands well then the peace which you before so urged lies in his answer brother we shall go uncle exeter and brother clarence and you brother gloucester warwick and huntington go with the king and take with you free power to ratify augment or alter as your wisdoms best shall see advantageable for our dignity anything in or out of our demands and we'll consign thereto will you fair sister go with the princes or stay here with us yet leave our cousin katherine here with us she is our capital demand comprised within the forerank of our articles fair katherine and most fair will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady's ear and plead his love suit to her gentle heart o fair katherine if you will love me soundly with your french heart i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue do you like me kate an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel i said so dear katherine and i must not blush to affirm it what says she fair one that the tongues of men are full of deceits the princess is the better englishwoman  i' faith kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding i am glad thou canst speak no better english for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my crown i know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say i love you then if you urge me farther than to say do you in faith i wear out my suit give me your answer i' faith do and so clap hands and a bargain how say you lady marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake kate why you undid me for the one i have neither words nor measure and for the other i have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength if i could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken i should quickly leap into a wife or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favors i could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes never off but before god kate i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor i have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which i never use till urged nor never break for urging if thou canst love a fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth sun burning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook i speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that i shall die is true but for thy love by the lord no yet i love thee too and while thou liv'st dear kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors they do always reason themselves out again what a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly if thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king and what say'st thou then to my love speak my fair and fairly i pray thee no it is not possible you should love the enemy of france kate but in loving me you should love the friend of france for i love france so well that i will not part with a village of it i will have it all mine and kate when france is mine and i am yours then yours is france and you are mine no kate i will tell thee in french which i am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new married wife about her husband's neck hardly to be shook off je quand sur le possession de france et quand vous avez le possession de moi let me see what then saint denis be my speed donc v\u00f4tre est france et vous \u00eates mienne it is as easy for me kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more french i shall never move thee in french unless it be to laugh at me no faith is 't not kate but thy speaking of my tongue and i thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one but kate dost thou understand thus much english canst thou love me can any of your neighbors tell kate i'll ask them come i know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet you'll question this gentlewoman about me and i know kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart but good kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because i love thee cruelly if ever thou beest mine kate as i have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt i get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier breeder shall not thou and i between saint denis and saint george compound a boy half french half english that shall go to constantinople and take the turk by the beard shall we not what say'st thou my fair flower de luce no 'tis hereafter to know but now to promise do but now promise kate you will endeavor for your french part of such a boy and for my english moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor how answer you la plus belle katherine du monde mon tr\u00e8s cher et divin d\u00e9esse now fie upon my false french by mine honor in true english i love thee kate by which honor i dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage now beshrew my father's ambition he was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was i created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when i come to woo ladies i fright them but in faith kate the elder i wax the better i shall appear my comfort is that old age that ill layer up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better and therefore tell me most fair katherine will you have me put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say harry of england i am thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but i will tell thee aloud england is thine ireland is thine france is thine and henry plantagenet is thine who though i speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good fellows come your answer in broken music for thy voice is music and thy english broken therefore queen of all katherine break thy mind to me in broken english wilt thou have me nay it will please him well kate it shall please him kate upon that i kiss your hand and i call you my queen then i will kiss your lips kate madam my interpreter what says she to kiss it is not a fashion for the maids in france to kiss before they are married would she say o kate nice customs curtsy to great kings dear kate you and i cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion we are the makers of manners kate and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find faults as i will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yielding you have witchcraft in your lips kate there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the french council and they should sooner persuade harry of england than a general petition of monarchs here comes your father i would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly i love her and that is good english our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me i cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and so i shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she must be blind too it is so and you may some of you thank love for my blindness who cannot see many a fair french city for one fair french maid that stands in my way shall kate be my wife i am content so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will is 't so my lords of england i pray you then in love and dear alliance let that one article rank with the rest and thereupon give me your daughter now welcome kate and bear me witness all that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen amen prepare we for our marriage on which day my lord of burgundy we'll take your oath and all the peers' for surety of our leagues then shall i swear to kate and you to me and may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be", "Tit_Titus": "hail rome victorious in thy mourning weeds lo as the bark that hath discharged his fraught returns with precious lading to the

your grace bonjour the hunt is up the moon is bright and gray the fields are fragrant and the woods are green uncouple here and let us make a bay and wake the emperor and his lovely bride and rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal that all the court may echo with the noise sons let it be your charge as it is ours to attend the emperor's person carefully i have been troubled in my sleep this night but dawning day new comfort hath inspired many good morrows to your majesty  madam to you as many and as good  i promis\u00e8d your grace a hunter's peal and i have horse will follow where the game makes way and runs like swallows o'er the plain high emperor upon my feeble knee i beg this boon with tears not lightly shed that this fell fault of my accurs\u00e8d sons  accurs\u00e8d if the faults be proved in them  i did my lord yet let me be their bail for by my father's reverend tomb i vow they shall be ready at your highness' will to answer their suspicion with their lives come lucius come stay not to talk with them hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay for pity of mine age whose youth was spent in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept for all my blood in rome's great quarrel shed for all the frosty nights that i have watched and for these bitter tears which now you see filling the ag\u00e8d wrinkles in my cheeks be pitiful to my condemn\u00e8d sons whose souls is not corrupted as 'tis thought for two and twenty sons i never wept because they died in honor's lofty bed for these tribunes in the dust i write my heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite my sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush o earth i will befriend thee more with rain that shall distil from these two ancient ruins than youthful april shall with all his showers in summer's drought i'll drop upon thee still in winter with warm tears i'll melt the snow and keep eternal springtime on thy face so thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood o reverend tribunes o gentle ag\u00e8d men unbind my sons reverse the doom of death and let me say that never wept before my tears are now prevailing orators ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead  grave tribunes once more i entreat of you  why 'tis no matter man if they did hear they would not mark me if they did mark they would not pity me yet plead i must and bootless unto them therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones who though they cannot answer my distress yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes for that they will not intercept my tale when i do weep they humbly at my feet receive my tears and seem to weep with me and were they but attir\u00e8d in grave weeds rome could afford no tribunes like to these a stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones a stone is silent and offendeth not and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death but wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn o happy man they have befriended thee why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive that rome is but a wilderness of tigers tigers must prey and rome affords no prey but me and mine how happy art thou then from these devourers to be banish\u00e8d but who comes with our brother marcus here will it consume me let me see it then why marcus so she is faint hearted boy arise and look upon her  speak lavinia what accurs\u00e8d hand hath made thee handless in thy father's sight what fool hath added water to the sea or brought a faggot to bright burning troy my grief was at the height before thou cam'st and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds  give me a sword i'll chop off my hands too for they have fought for rome and all in vain and they have nursed this woe in feeding life in bootless prayer have they been held up and they have served me to effectless use now all the service i require of them is that the one will help to cut the other  'tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands for hands to do rome service is but vain it was my dear and he that wounded her hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead for now i stand as one upon a rock environed with a wilderness of sea who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave expecting ever when some envious surge will in his brinish bowels swallow him this way to death my wretched sons are gone here stands my other son a banished man and here my brother weeping at my woes but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn is dear lavinia dearer than my soul had i but seen thy picture in this plight it would have madded me what shall i do now i behold thy lively body so thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears nor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee thy husband he is dead and for his death thy brothers are condemned and dead by this  look marcus ah son lucius look on her when i did name her brothers then fresh tears stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew upon a gathered lily almost withered if they did kill thy husband then be joyful because the law hath ta'en revenge on them  no no they would not do so foul a deed witness the sorrow that their sister makes  gentle lavinia let me kiss thy lips or make some sign how i may do thee ease shall thy good uncle and thy brother lucius and thou and i sit round about some fountain looking all downwards to behold our cheeks how they are stained like meadows yet not dry with miry slime left on them by a flood and in the fountain shall we gaze so long till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness and made a brine pit with our bitter tears or shall we cut away our hands like thine or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows pass the remainder of our hateful days what shall we do let us that have our tongues plot some device of further misery to make us wondered at in time to come ah marcus marcus brother well i wot thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine for thou poor man hast drowned it with thine own mark marcus mark i understand her signs had she a tongue to speak now would she say that to her brother which i said to thee his napkin with his true tears all bewet can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks o what a sympathy of woe is this as far from help as limbo is from bliss o gracious emperor o gentle aaron did ever raven sing so like a lark that gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise with all my heart i'll send the emperor my hand good aaron wilt thou help to chop it off sirs strive no more such withered herbs as these are meet for plucking up and therefore mine agree between you i will spare my hand come hither aaron i'll deceive them both lend me thy hand and i will give thee mine now stay your strife what shall be is dispatched  good aaron give his majesty my hand tell him it was a hand that warded him from thousand dangers bid him bury it more hath it merited that let it have as for my sons say i account of them as jewels purchased at an easy price and yet dear too because i bought mine own o here i lift this one hand up to heaven and bow this feeble ruin to the earth if any power pities wretched tears to that i call what wouldst thou kneel with me do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim and stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds when they do hug him in their melting bosoms is not my sorrow deep having no bottom then be my passions bottomless with them if there were reason for these miseries then into limits could i bind my woes when heaven doth weep doth not the earth o'erflow if the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad threat'ning the welkin with his big swoll'n face and wilt thou have a reason for this coil i am the sea hark how her sighs doth flow she is the weeping welkin i the earth then must my sea be mov\u00e8d with her sighs then must my earth with her continual tears become a deluge overflowed and drowned forwhy my bowels cannot hide her woes but like a drunkard must i vomit them then give me leave for losers will have leave to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues when will this fearful slumber have an end ha ha ha why i have not another tear to shed besides this sorrow is an enemy and would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes and make them blind with tributary tears then which way shall i find revenge's cave for these two heads do seem to speak to me and threat me i shall never come to bliss till all these mischiefs be returned again even in their throats that hath committed them come let me see what task i have to do you heavy people circle me about that i may turn me to each one of you and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs the vow is made come brother take a head and in this hand the other will i bear  and lavinia thou shalt be employed in these arms bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth  as for thee boy go get thee from my sight thou art an exile and thou must not stay hie to the goths and raise an army there and if you love me as i think you do let's kiss and part for we have much to do so so now sit and look you eat no more than will preserve just so much strength in us as will revenge these bitter woes of ours marcus unknit that sorrow wreathen knot thy niece and i poor creatures want our hands and cannot passionate our tenfold grief with folded arms this poor right hand of mine is left to tyrannize upon my breast who when my heart all mad with misery beats in this hollow prison of my flesh then thus i thump it down  thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating thou canst not strike it thus to make it still wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans or get some little knife between thy teeth and just against thy heart make thou a hole that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall may run into that sink and soaking in drown the lamenting fool in sea salt tears how now has sorrow made thee dote already why marcus no man should be mad but i what violent hands can she lay on her life ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands to bid aeneas tell the tale twice o'er how troy was burnt and he made miserable o handle not the theme to talk of hands lest we remember still that we have none  fie fie how franticly i square my talk as if we should forget we had no hands if marcus did not name the word of hands come let's fall to and gentle girl eat this here is no drink hark marcus what she says i can interpret all her martyred signs she says she drinks no other drink but tears brewed with her sorrow mashed upon her cheeks  speechless complainer i will learn thy thought in thy dumb action will i be as perfect as begging hermits in their holy prayers thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign but i of these will wrest an alphabet and by still practice learn to know thy meaning peace tender sapling thou art made of tears and tears will quickly melt thy life away what dost thou strike at marcus with thy knife out on thee murderer thou kill'st my heart mine eyes are cloyed with view of tyranny a deed of death done on the innocent becomes not titus' brother get thee gone i see thou art not for my company but how if that fly had a father and mother how would he hang his slender gilded wings and buzz lamenting doings in the air poor harmless fly that with his pretty buzzing melody came here to make us merry and thou hast killed him o o o then pardon me for reprehending thee for thou hast done a charitable deed give me thy knife i will insult on him flattering myself as if it were the moor come hither purposely to poison me there's for thyself and that's for tamora ah sirrah yet i think we are not brought so low but that between us we can kill a fly that comes in likeness of a coal black moor come take away lavinia go with me i'll to thy closet and go read with thee sad stories

heart durst make too bold a herald of my tongue where the impression of mine eye infixing contempt his scornful perspective did lend me which warped the line of every other favor scorned a fair color or expressed it stol'n extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object thence it came that she whom all men praised and whom myself since i have lost have loved was in mine eye the

shall as easy prove that i husbanded her bed in florence where yet she never was my lord i neither can nor will deny but that i know them do they charge me further she's none of mine my lord my lord this is a fond and desp'rate creature whom sometime i have laughed with let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honor than for to think that i would sink it here she's impudent my lord

this for what he'll utter that will speak anything i think she has certain it is i liked her and boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth she knew her distance and did angle for me madding my eagerness with her restraint as all impediments in fancy's course are motives of more fancy and in fine her infinite cunning with her modern grace subdued me to her rate she got the ring and i had that which

hour now the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swagg'ring upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge ay marry is 't but to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honored in the breach than the observance this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traduced and taxed of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though performed at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by the o'ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o'erleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature's livery or fortune's star his virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of evil doth

let's go together well god a mercy excellent well you are a fishmonger then i would you were so honest a man ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter let her not walk i' th' sun conception is a blessing but as your daughter may conceive friend look to 't words words words between who slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have gray beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself sir shall grow old as i am if like a crab you could go backward into my grave you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life these tedious old fools my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do you both nor the soles of her shoe then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favors in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what news then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither denmark's a prison a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o' th' worst why then 'tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams a dream itself is but a shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows shall we to th' court for by my fay i cannot reason no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come come deal justly with me come come nay speak anything but to th' purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color i know the good king and queen have sent for you that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer can charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen molt no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o'erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor women neither though by your smiling you seem to say so why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute on me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' th' sear and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for 't what players are they how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed how comes it do they grow rusty what are they children who maintains 'em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession is 't possible do the boys carry it away it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little 'sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come then th' appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outwards should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir a monday morning 'twas then indeed my lord i have news to tell you when roscius was an actor in rome  buzz buzz then came each actor on his ass o jephthah judge of israel what a treasure hadst thou why one fair daughter and no more the which he lov\u00e8d passing well am i not i' th' right old jephthah nay that follows not why as by lot god wot and then you know it came to pass as most like it was  the first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look where my abridgment comes you are welcome masters welcome all i am glad to see thee well welcome good friends o my old friend why thy face is valanced since i saw thee last com'st thou to beard me in denmark what my young lady and mistress by 'r lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chopine pray god your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring masters you are all welcome we'll e'en to 't like french falconers fly at anything we see we'll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million 'twas caviary to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in 't i chiefly loved 'twas aeneas' tale to dido and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of priam's slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th' hyrcanian beast  'tis not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couch\u00e8d in th' ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smeared with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly tricked with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons baked and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damn\u00e8d light to their lord's murder roasted in wrath and fire and thus o'ersiz\u00e8d with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you it shall to the barber's with your beard  prithee say on he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba the mobl\u00e8d queen 'tis well i'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live god's bodykins man much better use every man after his desert and who shall 'scape whipping use them after your own honor and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in follow him friends we'll hear a play tomorrow dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago we'll ha 't tomorrow night you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in 't could you not very well follow that lord and look you mock him not my good friends i'll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore ay so good bye to you now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wanned tears in his eyes distraction in his aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what's hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appall the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damned defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i' th' throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha 'swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeon livered and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave's offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murdered prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a stallion fie upon 't foh about my brains hum i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i'll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i'll observe his looks i'll tent him to the quick if he do blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be a devil and the devil hath power t' assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i'll have grounds more relative than this the play's the thing wherein i'll catch the conscience of the king to be or not to be that is the question whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep  no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished to die to sleep  to sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there's the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time th' oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely the pangs of despised love the law's delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of th' unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pitch and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remembered i humbly thank you well no not i i never gave you aught ha ha are you honest are you fair that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offenses at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where's your father let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in 's own house farewell if thou dost marry i'll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell i have heard of your paintings too well enough god hath given you one face and you make yourselves another you jig and amble and you lisp you nickname god's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance go to i'll no more on 't it hath made me mad i say we will have no more marriage those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are to a nunnery go speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of our players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so o'erdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it makes the unskillful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theater of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having th' accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that's villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready how now my lord will the king hear this piece of work bid the players make haste will you two help to hasten them what ho horatio horatio thou art e'en as just a man as e'er my conversation coped withal nay do not think i flatter for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits to feed and clothe thee why should the poor be flattered no let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning dost thou hear since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish her election hath sealed thee for herself for thou hast been as one in suffering all that suffers nothing a man that fortune's buffets and rewards hast ta'en with equal thanks and blessed are those whose blood and judgment are so well commeddled that they are not a pipe for fortune's finger to sound what stop she please give me that man that is not passion's slave and i will wear him in my heart's core ay in my heart of heart as i do thee something too much of this  there is a play tonight before the king one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my father's death i prithee when thou seest that act afoot even with the very comment of thy soul observe my uncle if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech it is a damn\u00e8d ghost that we have seen and my imaginations are as foul as vulcan's stithy give him heedful note for i mine eyes will rivet to his face and after we will both our judgments join in censure of his seeming they are coming to the play i must be idle get you a place excellent i' faith of the chameleon's dish i eat the air promise crammed you cannot feed capons so no nor mine now my lord you played once i' th' university you say what did you enact it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there be the players ready no good mother here's metal more attractive lady shall i lie in your lap i mean my head upon your lap do you think i meant country matters that's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs nothing who i o god your only jig maker what should a man do but be merry for look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died within 's two hours so long nay then let the devil wear black for i'll have a suit of sables o heavens die two months ago and not forgotten yet then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year but by 'r lady he must build churches then or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the hobby horse whose epitaph is for oh for oh the hobby horse is forgot marry this is miching mallecho it means mischief we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel they'll tell all ay or any show that you will show him be not you ashamed to show he'll not shame to tell you what it means is this a prologue or the posy of a ring as woman's love that's wormwood if she should break it now madam how like you this play o but she'll keep her word no no they do but jest poison in jest no offense i' th' world the mousetrap marry how tropically this play is the image of a murder done in vienna gonzago is the duke's name his wife baptista you shall see anon 'tis a knavish piece of work but what of that your majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not let the galled jade wince our withers are unwrung this is one lucianus nephew to the king i could interpret between you and your love if i could see the puppets dallying it would cost you a groaning to take off mine edge so you mis take your husbands begin murderer pox leave thy damnable faces and begin come the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge he poisons him i' th' garden for his estate his name's gonzago the story is extant and written in very choice italian you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of gonzago's wife what frighted with false fire why let the strucken deer go weep the hart ungall\u00e8d play for some must watch while some must sleep thus runs the world away would not this sir and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn turk with me with two provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players a whole one i for thou dost know o damon dear this realm dismantled was of jove himself and now reigns here a very very pajock o good horatio i'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound didst perceive upon the talk of the poisoning ah ha come some music come the recorders for if the king like not the comedy why then belike he likes it not perdy come some music sir a whole history ay sir what of him with drink sir your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor for for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more choler i am tame sir pronounce you are welcome sir i cannot make you a wholesome answer my wit's diseased but sir such answer as i can make you shall command or rather as you say my mother therefore no more but to the matter my mother you say  o wonderful son that can so 'stonish a mother but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration impart we shall obey were she ten times our mother have you any further trade with us and do still by these pickers and stealers sir i lack advancement ay sir but while the grass grows the proverb is something musty o the recorders let me see one to withdraw with you why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil i do not well understand that will you play upon this pipe i pray you i do beseech you it is as easy as lying govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music look you these are the stops why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me you would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it speak 'sblood do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe call me what instrument you will though you can fret me you cannot play upon me god bless you sir do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel methinks it is like a weasel or like a whale then i will come to my mother by and by they fool me to the top of my bent i will come by and by by and by is easily said leave me friends 'tis now the very witching time of night when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world now could i drink hot blood and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on soft now to my mother o heart lose not thy nature let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom let me be cruel not unnatural i will speak daggers to her but use none my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites how in my words somever she be shent to give them seals never my soul consent now might i do it pat now he is a praying and now i'll do 't and so he goes to heaven and so am i revenged that would be scanned a villain kills my father and for that i his sole son do this same villain send to heaven why this is hire and salary not revenge he took my father grossly full of bread with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may and how his audit stands who knows save heaven but in our circumstance and course of thought 'tis heavy with him and am i then revenged to take him in the purging of his soul when he is fit and seasoned for his passage no up sword and know thou a more horrid hent when he is drunk asleep or in his rage or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed at game a swearing or about some act that has no relish of salvation in 't  then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven and that his soul may be as damned and black as hell whereto it goes my mother stays this physic but prolongs thy sickly days mother mother mother now mother what's the matter mother you have my father much offended go go you question with a wicked tongue what's the matter now no by the rood not so you are the queen your husband's brother's wife and would it were not so you are my mother come come and sit you down you shall not budge you go not till i set you up a glass where you may see the inmost part of you how now a rat dead for a ducat dead nay i know not is it the king a bloody deed almost as bad good mother as kill a king and marry with his brother ay lady it was my word thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell i took thee for thy better take thy fortune thou find'st to be too busy is some danger leave wringing of your hands peace sit you down and let me wring your heart for so i shall if it be made of penetrable stuff if damn\u00e8d custom have not brazed it so that it be proof and bulwark against sense such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and sets a blister there makes marriage vows as false as dicers' oaths o such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words heaven's face does glow o'er this solidity and compound mass with heated visage as against the doom is thought sick at the act look here upon this picture and on this the counterfeit presentment of two brothers see what a grace was seated on this brow hyperion's curls the front of jove himself an eye like mars' to threaten and command a station like the herald mercury new lighted on a kissing hill a combination and a form indeed where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance of a man this was your husband look you now what follows here is your husband like a mildewed ear blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes could you on this fair mountain leave to feed and batten on this moor ha have you eyes you cannot call it love for at your age the heyday in the blood is tame it's humble and waits upon the judgment and what judgment would step from this to this sense sure you have else could you not have motion but sure that sense is apoplexed for madness would not err nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thralled but it reserved some quantity of choice to serve in such a difference what devil was 't that thus hath cozened you at hoodman blind eyes without feeling feeling without

this straw this is th' impostume of much wealth and peace that inward breaks and shows no cause without why the man dies i humbly thank you sir i'll be with you straight go a little before how all occasions do inform against me and spur my dull revenge what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed a beast no more sure he that made us with such large discourse looking before and after gave us not that capability and godlike reason to fust in us unused now whether it be bestial oblivion or some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on th' event a thought which quartered hath but one part wisdom and ever three parts coward i do not know why yet i live to say this thing's to do sith i have cause and will and strength and means to do 't examples gross as earth exhort me witness this army of such mass and charge led by a delicate and tender prince whose spirit with divine ambition puffed makes mouths at the invisible event exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune death and danger dare even for an eggshell rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honor's at the stake how stand i then that have a father killed a mother stained excitements of my reason and my blood and let all sleep while to my shame i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men that for a fantasy and trick of fame go to their graves like beds fight for a plot whereon the numbers cannot try the cause which is not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain o from this time forth my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth has this fellow no feeling of his business he sings in grave making 'tis e'en so the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once how the knave jowls it to the ground as if 'twere cain's jawbone that did the first murder this might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o'erreaches one that would circumvent god might it not or of a courtier which could say good morrow sweet lord how dost thou sweet lord this might be my lord such a one that praised my lord such a one's horse when he went to beg it might it not why e'en so and now my lady worm's chapless and knocked about the mazard with a sexton's spade here's fine revolution an we had the trick to see 't did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with them mine ache to think on 't there's another why may not that be the skull of a lawyer where be his quiddities now his quillities his cases his tenures and his tricks why does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery hum this fellow might be in 's time a great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures the very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box and must th' inheritor himself have no more ha is not parchment made of sheepskins they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that i will speak to this fellow  whose grave's this sirrah i think it be thine indeed for thou liest in 't thou dost lie in 't to be in 't and say it is thine 'tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest what man dost thou dig it for what woman then who is to be buried in 't how absolute the knave is we must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us by the lord horatio this three years i have took note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe how long hast thou been grave maker how long is that since ay marry why was he sent into england why how came he mad how strangely upon what ground how long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot why he more than another whose was it nay i know not this let me see alas poor yorick i knew him horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath bore me on his back a thousand times and now how abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rises at it here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft where be your gibes now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar not one now to mock your own grinning quite chapfallen now get you to my lady's chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this favor she must come make her laugh at that prithee horatio tell me one thing dost thou think alexander looked o' this fashion i' th' earth and smelt so pah to what base uses we may return horatio why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died alexander was buried alexander returneth to dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer barrel imperious caesar dead and turned to clay might stop a hole to keep the wind away o that that earth which kept the world in awe should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw but soft but soft awhile here comes the king the queen the courtiers who is this they follow and with such maim\u00e8d rites this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desp'rate hand fordo its own life 'twas of some estate couch we awhile and mark that is laertes a very noble youth mark what the fair ophelia what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wand'ring stars and makes them stand like wonder wounded hearers this is i hamlet the dane thou pray'st not well i prithee take thy fingers from my throat for though i am not splenitive and rash yet have i in me something dangerous which let thy wisdom fear hold off thy hand why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum what wilt thou do for her 'swounds show me what thou 't do woo't weep woo't fight woo't fast woo't tear thyself woo't drink up eisel eat a crocodile i'll do 't dost thou come here to whine to outface me with leaping in her grave be buried quick with her and so will i and if thou prate of mountains let them throw millions of acres on us till our ground singeing his pate against the burning zone make ossa like a wart nay an thou 'lt mouth i'll rant as well as thou hear you sir what is the reason that you use me thus i loved you ever but it is no matter let hercules himself do what he may the cat will mew and dog will have his day so much for this sir now shall you see the other you do remember all the circumstance sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly  and praised be rashness for it let us know our indiscretion sometime serves us well when our deep plots do pall and that should learn us there's a divinity that shapes our ends rough hew them how we will  up from my cabin my sea gown scarfed about me in the dark groped i to find out them had my desire fingered their packet and in fine withdrew to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unfold their grand commission where i found horatio a royal knavery an exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmark's health and england's too with ho such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the ax my head should be struck off here's the commission read it at more leisure but wilt thou hear now how i did proceed being thus benetted round with villainies or i could make a prologue to my brains they had begun the play i sat me down devised a new commission wrote it fair  i once did hold it as our statists do a baseness to write fair and labored much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeoman's service wilt thou know th' effect of what i wrote an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm might flourish as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma 'tween their amities and many suchlike es of great charge that on the view and knowing of these contents without debatement further more or less he should those bearers put to sudden death not shriving time allowed why even in that was heaven ordinant i had my father's signet in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in the form of th' other subscribed it gave 't th' impression placed it safely the changeling never known now the next day was our sea fight and what to this was sequent thou knowest already why man they did make love to this employment they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow 'tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incens\u00e8d points of mighty opposites does it not think thee stand me now upon  he that hath killed my king and whored my mother popped in between th' election and my hopes thrown out his angle for my proper life and with such cozenage is 't not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm and is 't not to be damned to let this canker of our nature come in further evil it will be short the interim's mine and a man's life's no more than to say one but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his i'll court his favors but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a tow'ring passion i humbly thank you sir dost know this waterfly thy state is the more gracious for 'tis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king's mess 'tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit put your bonnet to his right use 'tis for the head no believe me 'tis very cold the wind is northerly but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion i beseech you remember sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath what imports the nomination of this gentleman of him sir i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself what's his weapon that's two of his weapons but well  what call you the carriages the phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages  that's the french bet against the danish why is this all impawned as you call it how if i answer no sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty it is the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will yours he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for 's turn he did comply sir with his dug before he sucked it thus has he and many more of the same breed that i know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and out of an habit of encounter a kind of yeasty collection which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out i am constant to my purposes they follow the king's pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now in happy time she well instructs me i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart but it is no matter it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman not a whit we defy augury there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now 'tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man of aught he leaves knows what is 't to leave betimes let be give me your pardon sir i have done you wrong but pardon 't as you are a gentleman this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punished with a sore distraction what i have done that might your nature honor and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness was 't hamlet wronged laertes never hamlet if hamlet from himself be ta'en away and when he's not himself does wrong laertes then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it who does it then his madness if 't be so hamlet is of the faction that is wronged his madness is poor hamlet's enemy sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot my arrow o'er the house and hurt my brother i embrace it freely and will this brothers' wager frankly play  give us the foils come on i'll be your foil laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i' th' darkest night stick fiery off indeed no by this hand very well my lord your grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side this likes me well these foils have all a length come on sir one judgment i'll play this bout first set it by awhile come

i make will but remember me what a deal of world i wander from the jewels that i love must i not serve a long apprenticehood to foreign passages and in the end having my freedom boast of nothing else but that i was a journeyman to grief o who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking on the frosty caucasus or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast or wallow naked in december snow by thinking on fantastic summer's heat o no the apprehension of the good gives but the greater feeling to the worse fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more than when he bites but lanceth not

love with my greatness what a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name or to know thy face tomorrow or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast with these and those that were thy peach colored ones or to bear the inventory of thy shirts as one for superfluity and another for use but that the tennis court keeper knows better than i for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou

my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow what wouldst thou think of me if i should weep it would be every man's thought and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks never a man's thought in the world keeps the roadway better than thine every man would think me an hypocrite

wilfull abuse and then i know how to handle you not to dispraise me and call me pantler and bread chipper and i know not what see now whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us is she of the wicked is thine hostess here of the wicked or is thy boy of the wicked or honest bardolph whose zeal burns in his nose of the wicked for the women you gentlewoman peto how now what news by heaven poins i feel me much to blame so idly to profane the precious time when tempest of commotion like the south borne with black vapor doth begin to melt and drop upon our bare unarm\u00e8d heads  give me my sword and cloak falstaff good night who saw the duke of clarence how now rain within doors and none abroad how doth the king heard he the good news yet tell it him if he be sick with joy he'll recover without physic no i will sit and watch here by the king why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow being so troublesome a bedfellow o polished perturbation golden care that keep'st the ports of slumber open wide to many a watchful night sleep with it now yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet as he whose brow with homely biggen bound snores out the watch of night o majesty when thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit like a rich armor worn in heat of day that scald'st with safety by his gates of breath there lies a downy feather which stirs not did he suspire that light and weightless down perforce must move my gracious lord my father this sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep that from this golden rigol hath divorced so many english kings thy due from me is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood which nature love and filial tenderness shall o dear father pay thee plenteously my due from thee is this imperial crown which as immediate from thy place and blood derives itself to me lo where it sits which god shall guard and put the world's whole strength into one giant arm it shall not force this lineal honor from me this from thee will i to mine leave as 'tis left to me i never thought to hear you speak again o pardon me my liege but for my tears the moist impediments unto my speech i had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard the course of it so far there is your crown and he that wears the crown immortally long guard it yours if i affect it more than as your honor and as your renown let me no more from this obedience rise which my most inward true and duteous spirit teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending god witness with me when i here came in and found no course of breath within your majesty how cold it struck my heart if i do feign o let me in my present wildness die and never live to show th' incredulous world the noble change that i have purpos\u00e8d coming to look on you thinking you dead and dead almost my liege to think you were i spake unto this crown as having sense and thus upbraided it the care on thee depending hath fed upon the body of my father therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold other less fine in carat is more precious preserving life in med'cine potable but thou most fine most honored most renowned hast eat thy bearer up thus my most royal liege accusing it i put it on my head to try with it as with an enemy that had before my face murdered my father the quarrel of a true inheritor but if it did infect my blood with joy or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride if any rebel or vain spirit of mine did with the least affection of a welcome give entertainment to the might of it let god forever keep it from my head and make me as the poorest vassal is that doth with awe and terror kneel to it my gracious liege you won it wore it kept it gave it me then plain and right must my possession be which i with more than with a common pain 'gainst all the world will rightfully maintain my lord of warwick this new and gorgeous garment majesty sits not so easy on me as you think  brothers you mix your sadness with some fear this is the english not the turkish court not amurath an amurath succeeds but harry harry yet be sad good brothers for by my faith it very well becomes you sorrow so royally in you appears that i will deeply put the fashion on and wear it in my heart why then be sad but entertain no more of it good brothers than a joint burden laid upon us all for me by heaven i bid you be assured i'll be your father and your brother too let me but bear your love i'll bear your cares yet weep that harry's dead and so will i but harry lives that shall convert those tears by number into hours of happiness you all look strangely on me and you most you are i think assured i love you not no how might a prince of my great hopes forget so great indignities you laid upon me what rate rebuke and roughly send to prison th' immediate heir of england was this easy may this be washed in lethe and forgotten you are right justice and you weigh this well therefore still bear the balance and the sword and i do wish your honors may increase till you do live to see a son of mine offend you and obey you as i did so shall i live to speak my father's words happy am i that have a man so bold that dares do justice on my proper son and not less happy having such a son that would deliver up his greatness so into the hands of justice you did commit me for which i do commit into your hand th' unstain\u00e8d sword that you have used to bear with this remembrance that you use the same with the like bold just and impartial spirit as you have done 'gainst me there is my hand you shall be as a father to my youth my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear and i will stoop and humble my intents to your well practiced wise directions  and princes all believe me i beseech you my father

the feeder of my riots till then i banish thee on pain of death as i have done the rest of my misleaders not to come near our person by ten mile for competence of life i will allow you that lack of

and sway in love that have inflamed desire in my breast to taste the fruit of yon celestial tree or die in th' adventure be my helps as i am son and servant to your will to compass such a boundless happiness that would be son to great antiochus antiochus i thank thee who hath taught my frail mortality to know itself and by those fearful objects to prepare this body like to them to what i must

earthly joys as erst they did so i bequeath a happy peace to you and all good men as every prince should do my riches to the earth from whence they came but my unspotted fire of love to you  thus ready for the way of life or death i wait the sharpest blow like a bold champion i assume the lists nor ask advice of any other thought but faithfulness and courage i am no viper yet i feed on mother's flesh which did me breed i sought a husband in which labor i found that kindness in a father he's father son and husband mild i mother wife and yet his child how they may be and yet in two as you will live resolve it you sharp physic is the last but o you powers that gives heaven countless eyes to view men's acts why cloud they not their sights perpetually if this be true which makes me pale to read it fair glass of light i loved you and could still were not this glorious casket stored with ill but i must tell you now my thoughts revolt for he's no man on whom perfections wait that knowing sin within will touch the gate you are a fair viol and your sense the strings who fingered to make man his lawful music would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken but being played upon before your time hell only danceth at so harsh a chime good sooth i care not for you great king few love to hear the sins they love to act 'twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it who has a book of all that monarchs do he's more secure to keep it shut than shown for vice repeated is like the wand'ring wind blows dust in others' eyes to spread itself and yet the end of all is bought thus dear the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear to stop the air would hurt them the blind mole casts copped hills towards heaven to tell the earth is thronged by man's oppression and the poor worm doth die for 't kings are earth's gods in vice their law's their will and if jove stray who dares say jove doth ill it is enough you know and it is fit what being more known grows worse to smother it all love the womb that their first being bred then give my tongue like leave to love my head how courtesy would seem to cover sin when what is done is like an hypocrite the which is good in nothing but in sight if it be true that i interpret false then were it certain you were not so bad as with foul incest to abuse your soul where now you're both a father and a son by your untimely claspings with your child which pleasures fits a husband not a father and she an eater of her mother's flesh by the defiling of her parents' bed and both like serpents are who though they feed on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men blush not in actions blacker than the night will 'schew no course to keep them from the light one sin i know another doth provoke murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke poison and treason are the hands of sin ay and the targets to put off the shame then lest my life be cropped to keep you clear by flight i'll shun the danger which i fear let none disturb us why should this change of thoughts the sad companion dull eyed melancholy be my so used a guest as not an hour in the day's glorious walk or peaceful night the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them and danger which i feared is at antioch whose arm seems far too short to hit me here yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits nor yet the other's distance comfort me then it is thus the passions of the mind that have their first conception by misdread have after nourishment and life by care and what was first but fear what might be done grows elder now and cares it be not done and so with me the great antiochus 'gainst whom i am too little to contend since he's so great can make his will his act will think me speaking though i swear to silence nor boots it me to say i honor him if he suspect i may dishonor him and what may make him blush in being known he'll stop the course by which it might be known with hostile forces he'll o'er spread the land and with th' ostent of war will look so huge amazement shall drive courage from the state our men be vanquished ere they do resist and subjects punished that ne'er thought offense which care of them not pity of myself who am no more but as the tops of trees which fence the roots they grow by and defend them makes both my

thy servant what wouldst thou have me do thou speak'st like a physician helicanus that ministers a potion unto me that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself attend me then i went to antioch where as thou know'st against the face of death i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty from whence an issue i might propagate are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder the rest hark in thine ear as black as incest which by my knowledge found the sinful father seemed not to strike but smooth but thou know'st this 'tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss which fear so grew in me i hither fled under the covering of a careful night who seemed my good protector and being here bethought me what was past what might succeed i knew him tyrannous and tyrants' fears decrease not but grow faster than the years and should he doubt as no doubt he doth that i should open to the list'ning air how many worthy princes' bloods were shed to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope to lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms and make pretense of wrong that i have done him when all for mine if i may call 't offense must feel war's blow who spares not innocence which love to all of which thyself art one who now reproved'st me for 't  drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks musings into my mind with thousand doubts how i might stop this tempest ere it came and finding little comfort to relieve them i thought it princely charity to grieve for them i do not doubt thy faith but should he wrong my liberties in my absence tyre i now look from thee then and to tarsus intend my travel where i'll hear from thee and by whose letters i'll dispose myself the care i had and have of subjects' good on thee i lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it i'll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath who shuns not to break one will crack both but in our orbs we'll live so round and safe that time of both this truth shall ne'er convince thou showed'st a subject's shine i a true prince lord governor for so we hear you are let not our ships and number of our men be like a beacon fired t' amaze your eyes we have heard your miseries as far as tyre and seen the desolation of your streets nor come we to add sorrow to your tears but to relieve them of their heavy load and these our ships you happily may think are like the trojan horse was stuffed within with bloody veins expecting overthrow are stored with corn to make your needy bread and give them life whom hunger starved half dead arise i pray you rise we do not look for reverence but for love and harborage for ourself our ships and men which welcome we'll accept feast here awhile until our stars that frown lend us a smile yet cease your ire you angry stars of heaven wind rain and thunder remember earthly man is but a substance that must yield to you and i as fits my nature do obey you alas the seas hath cast me on the rocks washed me from shore to shore and left my breath nothing to think on but ensuing death let it suffice the greatness of your powers to have bereft a prince of all his fortunes and having thrown him from your wat'ry grave here to have death in peace is all he'll crave a pretty moral simonides how from the finny subject of the sea these fishers tell the infirmities of men and from their wat'ry empire recollect all that may men approve or men detect  peace be at your labor honest fishermen may see the sea hath cast upon your coast  a man whom both the waters and the wind in that vast tennis court hath made the ball for them to play upon entreats you pity him he asks of you that never used to beg i never practiced it what i have been i have forgot to know but what i am want teaches me to think on a man thronged up with cold my veins are chill and have no more of life than may suffice to give my tongue that heat to ask your help  which if you shall refuse when i am dead for that i am a man pray you see me buried i thank you sir i did but crave why are your beggars whipped then how well this honest mirth becomes their labor not well the good simonides do you call him he is a happy king since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government how far is his court distant from this shore were my fortunes equal to my desires i could wish to make one there an armor friends i pray you let me see it thanks fortune yet that after all thy crosses thou givest me somewhat to repair myself and though it was mine own part of my heritage which my dead father did bequeath to me with this strict charge even as he left his life keep it my pericles it hath been a shield 'twixt me and death and pointed to this brace for that it saved me keep it in like necessity  the which the gods protect thee from may 't defend thee it kept where i kept i so dearly loved it till the rough seas that spares not any man took it in rage though calmed have given 't again i thank thee for 't my shipwrack now's no ill since i have here my father gave in his will to beg of you kind friends this coat of worth for it was sometime target to a king i know it by this mark he loved me dearly and for his sake i wish the having of it and that you'd guide me to your sovereign's court where with it i may appear a gentleman and if that ever my low fortune's better i'll pay your bounties till then rest your debtor i'll show the virtue i have

little body is aweary of this great world good sentences and well pronounced if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor men's cottages princes' palaces it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband o me the word choose i may neither choose who i would nor refuse who i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father is it not hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none i pray thee overname them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection ay that's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith he doth nothing but frown as who should say an you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be married to a death's head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these god defend me from these two god made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the neapolitan's a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a cap'ring he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english he is a proper man's picture but alas who can converse with a dumb show how oddly he is suited i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behavior everywhere that he hath a neighborly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast an the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it i will do anything nerissa ere i will be married to a sponge if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my father's will i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant them a fair departure yes yes it was bassanio as i think so was he called i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise how now what news if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me come nerissa sirrah go before  whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the door in terms of choice i am not solely led by nice direction of a maiden's eyes besides the lott'ry of my destiny bars me the right of voluntary choosing but if my father had not scanted me and hedged me by his wit to yield myself his wife who wins me by that means i told you yourself renown\u00e8d prince then stood as fair as any comer i have looked on yet for my affection you must take your chance and either not attempt to choose at all or swear before you choose if you choose wrong never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage therefore be advised first forward to the temple after dinner your hazard shall be made go draw aside the curtains and discover the several caskets to this noble prince now make your choice the one of them contains my picture prince if you choose that then i am yours withal there take it prince and if my form lie there then i am yours a gentle riddance draw the curtains go let all of his complexion choose me so behold there stand the caskets noble prince if you choose that wherein i am contained straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized but if you fail without more speech my lord you must be gone from hence immediately to these injunctions everyone doth swear that comes to hazard for my worthless self too long a pause for that which you find there to offend and judge are distinct offices and of oppos\u00e8d natures thus hath the candle singed the moth o these deliberate fools when they do choose they have the wisdom by their wit to lose come draw the curtain nerissa here what would my lord no more i pray thee i am half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee thou spend'st such high day wit in praising him come come nerissa for i long to see quick cupid's post that comes so mannerly i pray you tarry pause a day or two before you hazard for in choosing wrong i lose your company therefore forbear a while there's something tells me but it is not love i would not lose you and you know yourself hate counsels not in such a quality but lest you should not understand me well and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought i would detain you here some month or two before you venture for me i could teach you how to choose right but then i am forsworn so will i never be so may you miss me but if you do you'll make me wish a sin that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes they have o'erlooked me and divided me one half of me is yours the other half yours  mine own i would say but if mine then yours and so all yours o these naughty times puts bars between the owners and their rights and so though yours not yours prove it so let fortune go to hell for it not i i speak too long but 'tis to peize the time to eche it and to draw it out in length to stay you from election upon the rack bassanio then confess what treason there is mingled with your love ay but i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforc\u00e8d do speak anything well then confess and live away then i am locked in one of them if you do love me you will find me out  nerissa and the rest stand all aloof let music sound while he doth make his choice then if he lose he makes a swanlike end fading in music that the comparison may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream and wat'ry deathbed for him he may win and what is music then then music is even as the flourish when true subjects bow to a new crown\u00e8d monarch such it is as are those dulcet sounds in break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear and summon him to marriage now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the sea monster i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives with blear\u00e8d visages come forth to view the issue of th' exploit go hercules live thou i live with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that mak'st the fray how all the other passions fleet to air as doubtful thoughts and rash embraced despair and shudd'ring fear and green eyed jealousy o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rain thy joy scant this excess i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit you see me lord bassanio where i stand such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich that only to stand high in your account i might in virtues beauties livings friends exceed account but the full sum of me is sum of something which to term in gross is an unlessoned girl unschooled unpracticed happy in this she is not yet so old but she may learn happier than this she is not bred so dull but she can learn happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord her governor her king myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted but now i was the lord of this fair mansion master of my servants queen o'er myself and even now but now this house these servants and this same myself are yours my lord's i give them with this ring which when you part from lose or give away let it presage the ruin of your love and be my vantage to exclaim on you is this true nerissa so do i my lord they are entirely welcome there are some shrewd contents in yond same paper that steals the color from bassanio's cheek some dear friend dead else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man what worse and worse  with leave bassanio i am half yourself and i must freely have the half of anything that this same paper brings you is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble what sum owes he the jew what no more pay him six thousand and deface the bond double six thousand and then treble that before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through bassanio's fault first go with me to church and call me wife and then away to venice to your friend for never shall you lie by portia's side with an unquiet soul you shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over when it is paid bring your true friend along my maid nerissa and myself meantime will live as maids and widows come away for you shall hence upon your wedding day bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer since you are dear bought i will love you dear but let me hear the letter of your friend o love dispatch all business and begone i never did repent for doing good nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this antonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord if it be so how little is the cost i have bestowed in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish cruelty this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it hear other things lorenzo i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lord's return for mine own part i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by nerissa here until her husband and my lord's return there is a monastery two miles off and there we will abide i do desire you not to deny this imposition the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you my people do already know my mind and will acknowledge you and jessica in place of lord bassanio and myself so fare you well till we shall meet again i thank you for your wish and am well pleased to wish it back on you fare you well jessica now balthazar as i have ever found thee honest true so let me find thee still take this same letter and use thou all th' endeavor of a man in speed to padua see thou render this into my cousin's hands doctor bellario and look what notes and garments he doth give thee bring them i pray thee with imagined speed unto the traject to the common ferry which trades to venice waste no time in words but get thee gone i shall be there before thee come on nerissa i have work in hand that you yet know not of we'll see our husbands before they think of us they shall nerissa but in such a habit that they shall think we are accomplish\u00e8d with that we lack i'll hold thee any wager when we are both accoutered like young men i'll prove the prettier fellow of the two and wear my dagger with the braver grace and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honorable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died  i could not do withal then i'll repent and wish for all that that i had not killed them and twenty of these puny lies i'll tell that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practice fie what a question's that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter but come i'll tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach which stays for us at the park gate and therefore haste away for we must measure twenty miles today i did my lord i am inform\u00e8d throughly of the cause which is the merchant here and which the jew is your name shylock of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law cannot impugn you as you do proceed you stand within his danger do you not do you confess the bond then must the jew be merciful the quality of mercy is not strained it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes 'tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the thron\u00e8d monarch better than his crown his scepter shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptered sway it is enthron\u00e8d in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest god's when mercy seasons justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there is he not able to discharge the money it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree establish\u00e8d 'twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it cannot be i pray you let me look upon the bond shylock there's thrice thy money offered thee why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchant's heart be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife  for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond therefore lay bare your bosom  it is so are there balance here to weigh the flesh have by some surgeon shylock on your charge to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death it is not so expressed but what of that 'twere good you do so much for charity you merchant have you anything to say your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer a pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine the court awards it and the law doth give it and you must cut this flesh from off his breast the law allows it and the court awards it tarry a little there is something else this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood the words expressly are a pound of flesh take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice confiscate unto the state of venice thyself shalt see the act for as thou urgest justice be assured thou shalt have justice more than thou desir'st soft the jew shall have all justice soft no haste he shall have nothing but the penalty therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh if thou tak'st more or less than a just pound be it but so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate why doth the jew pause take thy forfeiture he hath refused it in the open court he shall have merely justice and his bond thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture to be so taken at thy peril jew tarry jew the law hath yet another hold on you it is enacted in the laws of venice if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen the party 'gainst the which he doth contrive shall seize one half his goods the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state and the offender's life lies in the mercy of the duke only 'gainst all other voice in which predicament i say thou stand'st for it appears by manifest proceeding that indirectly and directly too thou hast contrived against the very life of the defendant and thou hast incurred the danger formerly by me rehearsed down therefore and beg mercy of the duke ay for the state not for antonio what mercy can you render him antonio art thou contented jew what dost thou say clerk draw a deed of gift i humbly do desire your grace of pardon i must away this night toward padua and it is meet i presently set forth he is well paid that is well satisfied and i delivering you am satisfied and therein do account myself well paid my mind was never yet more mercenary i pray you know me when we meet again i wish you well and so i take my leave you press me far and therefore i will yield give me your gloves i'll wear them for your sake  and for your love i'll take this ring from you do not draw back your hand i'll take no more and you in love shall not deny me this i will have nothing else but only this and now methinks i have a mind to it i see sir you are liberal in offers you taught me first to beg and now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answered that 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts and if your wife be not a madwoman and know how well i have deserved this ring she would not hold out enemy forever for giving it to me well peace be with you inquire the jew's house out give him this deed and let him sign it we'll away tonight and be a day before our husbands home this deed will be well welcome to lorenzo that cannot be his ring i do accept most thankfully and so i pray you tell him furthermore i pray you show my youth old shylock's house thou mayst i warrant we shall have old swearing that they did give the rings away to men but we'll outface them and outswear them too  away make haste thou know'st where i will tarry that light we see is burning in my hall how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world so doth the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king until a king be by and then his state empties itself as doth an inland brook into the main of waters music hark nothing is good i see without respect methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren how many things by season seasoned are to their right praise and true perfection peace how the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awaked he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo by the bad voice we have been praying for our husbands' welfare which speed we hope the better for our words are they returned go in nerissa give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence  nor you lorenzo jessica nor you this night methinks is but the daylight sick it looks a little paler 'tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid let me give light but let me not be light for a light wife doth make a heavy husband and never be bassanio so for me but god sort all you are welcome home my lord you should in all sense be much bound to him for as i hear he was much bound for you sir you are very welcome to our house it must appear in other ways than words therefore i scant this breathing courtesy a quarrel ho already what's the matter you were to blame i must be plain with you to part so slightly with your wife's first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it and here he stands i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters now in faith gratiano you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief an 'twere to me i should be mad at it what ring gave you my lord not that i hope which you received of me even so void is your false heart of truth by heaven i will ne'er come in your bed until i see the ring if you had known the virtue of the ring or half her worthiness that gave the ring or your own honor to contain the ring you would not then have parted with the ring what man is there so much unreasonable if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony nerissa teaches me what to believe i'll die for 't but some woman had the ring let not that doctor e'er come near my house since he hath got the jewel that i loved and that which you did swear to keep for me i will become as liberal as you i'll not deny him anything i have no not my body nor my husband's bed know him i shall i am well sure of it lie not a night from home watch me like argus if you do not if i be left alone now by mine honor which is yet mine own i'll have that doctor for my bedfellow sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding mark you but that in both my eyes he doubly sees himself in each eye one swear by your double self and there's an oath of credit then you shall be his surety give him this and bid him keep it better than the other i had it of him pardon me bassanio for by this ring the doctor lay with me speak not so grossly you are all amazed here is a letter read it at your leisure it comes from padua from bellario there you shall find that portia was the doctor nerissa there her clerk lorenzo here shall witness i set forth as soon as you and even but now returned i have not yet entered my house antonio you are welcome and i have better news in store for you than you expect unseal this letter soon there you shall find three of your argosies are richly come to harbor suddenly you shall not know by what strange accident i chanc\u00e8d on this letter how now lorenzo my clerk hath some

proceeded the sweet degrees that this brief world affords to such as may the passive drugs of it freely command thou wouldst have plunged thyself in general riot melted down thy youth in different beds of lust and never learned the icy precepts of respect but followed the sugared game before thee but myself  who had the world as my confectionary the mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men at duty more than i could frame employment that numberless upon me stuck as leaves do on the oak have with one winter's brush fell from their boughs and left me open bare for every storm that blows i to bear this that never knew but better is some burden thy nature did commence in sufferance time hath made thee hard in 't why shouldst thou hate men they never flattered thee what hast thou given if thou wilt curse thy father that poor rag must be thy subject who in spite put stuff to some she beggar and compounded thee poor rogue hereditary hence begone if thou hadst not been born the worst of men thou hadst been a knave and flatterer ay that i am not thee i that i am one now were all the wealth i have shut up in thee i'd give thee leave to hang it get thee gone that the whole life of athens were in this thus would i eat it first mend my company take away thyself 'tis not well mended so it is but botched if not i would it were thee thither in a whirlwind if thou wilt tell them there i have gold look so i have the best and truest for here it sleeps and does no hired harm under that's above me where feed'st thou a days apemantus would poison were obedient and knew my mind to sauce thy dishes on what i hate i feed not ay though it look like thee who without those means thou talk'st of didst thou ever know beloved i understand thee thou hadst some means to keep a dog women nearest but men men are the things themselves what wouldst thou do with the world apemantus if it lay in thy power wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men and remain a beast with the beasts a beastly ambition which the gods grant thee t' attain to if thou wert the lion the fox would beguile thee if thou wert the lamb the fox would eat thee if thou wert the fox the lion would suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass if thou wert the ass thy dullness would torment thee and still thou lived'st but as a breakfast to the wolf if thou wert the wolf thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner wert thou the unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury wert thou a bear thou wouldst be killed by the horse wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seized by the leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert germane to the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life all thy safety were remotion and thy defense absence what beast couldst thou be that were not subject to a beast and what a beast art thou already that seest not thy loss in transformation how has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city when there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be welcome i had rather be a beggar's dog than apemantus would thou wert clean enough to spit upon all villains that do stand by thee are pure if i name thee i'll beat thee but i should infect my hands away thou issue of a mangy dog choler does kill me that thou art alive i swoon to see thee away thou tedious rogue i am sorry i shall lose a stone by thee slave rogue rogue rogue i am sick of this false world and will love nought but even the mere necessities upon 't then timon presently prepare thy grave lie where the light foam of the sea may beat thy gravestone daily make thine epitaph that death in me at others' lives may laugh o thou sweet king killer and dear divorce 'twixt natural son and sire thou bright defiler of hymen's purest bed thou valiant mars thou ever young fresh loved and delicate wooer whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow that lies on dian's lap thou visible god that sold'rest close impossibilities and mak'st them kiss that speak'st with every tongue to every purpose o thou touch of hearts think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue set them into confounding odds that beasts may have the world in empire thronged to thy back i prithee long live so and so die i am quit now thieves both too and women's sons your greatest want is you want much of meat why should you want behold the earth hath roots within this mile break forth a hundred springs the oaks bear mast the briars scarlet hips the bounteous huswife nature on each bush lays her full mess before you want why want nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes you must eat men yet thanks i must you con that you are thieves professed that you work not in holier shapes for there is boundless theft in limited professions rascal thieves here's gold go suck the subtle blood o' th' grape till the high fever seethe your blood to froth and so 'scape hanging trust not the physician his antidotes are poison and he slays more than you rob take wealth and lives together do villainy do since you protest to do 't like workmen i'll example you with thievery the sun's a thief and with his great attraction robs the vast sea the moon's an arrant thief and her pale fire she snatches from the sun the sea's a thief whose liquid surge resolves the moon into salt tears the earth's a thief that feeds and breeds by a composture stol'n from gen'ral excrement each thing's a thief the laws your curb and whip in their rough power has unchecked theft love not yourselves away rob one another there's more goldcut throats all that you meet are thieves to athens go break open shops nothing can you steal but thieves do lose it steal less for this i give you and gold confound you howsoe'er amen away what art thou why dost ask that i have forgot all men then if thou grant'st thou 'rt a man i have forgot thee then i know thee not i never had honest man about me i all i kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains what dost thou weep come nearer then i love thee because thou art a woman and disclaim'st flinty mankind whose eyes do never give but thorough lust and laughter pity's sleeping strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping had i a steward so true so just and now so comfortable it almost turns my dangerous nature mild let me behold thy face surely this man was born of woman forgive my general and exceptless rashness you perpetual sober gods i do proclaim one honest man mistake me not but one no more i pray and he's a steward how fain would i have hated all mankind and thou redeem'st thyself but all save thee i fell with curses methinks thou art more honest now than wise for by oppressing and betraying me thou mightst have sooner got another service for many so arrive at second masters upon their first lord's neck but tell me true  for i must ever doubt though ne'er so sure  is not thy kindness subtle covetous a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts expecting in return twenty for one look thee 'tis so thou singly honest man here take the gods out of my misery has sent thee treasure go live rich and happy but thus conditioned thou shalt build from men hate all curse all show charity to none but let the famished flesh slide from the bone ere thou relieve the beggar give to dogs what thou deniest to men let prisons swallow 'em debts wither 'em to nothing be men like blasted woods and may diseases lick up their false bloods and so farewell and thrive if thou hat'st curses stay not fly whilst thou art blest and free ne'er see thou man and let me ne'er see thee excellent workman thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men do so i have gold for thee i'll meet you at the turn what a god's gold that he is worshiped in a baser temple than where swine feed 'tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plow'st the foam settlest admir\u00e8d reverence in a slave to thee be worship and thy saints for aye be crowned with plagues that thee alone obey fit i meet them have i once lived to see two honest men let it go naked men may see 't the better you that are honest by being what you are make them best seen and known ay you are honest men most honest men why how shall i requite you can you eat roots and drink cold water no you're honest men you've heard that i have gold i am sure you have speak truth you're honest men good honest men thou draw'st a counterfeit best in all athens thou 'rt indeed the best thou counterfeit'st most lively e'en so sir as i say and for thy fiction why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth that thou art even natural in thine art but for all this my honest natured friends i must needs say you have a little fault marry 'tis not monstrous in you neither wish i you take much pains to mend you'll take it ill will you indeed there's never a one of you but trusts a knave that mightily deceives you ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble know his gross patchery love him feed him keep in your bosom yet remain assured that he's a made up villain look you i love you well i'll give you gold rid me these villains from your companies hang them or stab them drown them in a draft confound them by some course and come to me i'll give you gold enough you that way and you this but two in company each man apart all single and alone yet an archvillain keeps him company if where thou art two villains shall not be come not near him if thou wouldst not reside but where one villain is then him abandon  hence pack there's gold you came for gold you slaves you have work for me there's payment hence you are an alchemist make gold of that out rascal dogs thou sun that comforts burn speak and be hanged for each true word a blister and each false be as a cauterizing to the root o' th' tongue consuming it with speaking of none but such as you and you of timon i thank them and would send them back the plague could i but catch it for them you witch me in it surprise me to the very brink of tears lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes and i'll beweep these comforts worthy senators well sir i will therefore i will sir thus if alcibiades kill my countrymen let alcibiades know this of timon  that timon cares not but if he sack fair athens and take our goodly ag\u00e8d men by th' beards giving our holy virgins to the stain of contumelious beastly mad brained war then let him know and tell him timon speaks it in pity of our ag\u00e8d and our youth i cannot choose but tell him that i care not and let him take 't at worst for their knives care not while you have throats to answer for myself there's not a whittle in th' unruly camp but i do prize it at my love before the reverend'st throat in athens so i leave you to the protection of the prosperous gods as thieves to keepers why i was writing of my epitaph it will be seen tomorrow my long sickness of health and living now begins to mend and nothing brings me all things go live still be alcibiades your plague you his and last so long enough but yet i love my country and am not one that rejoices in the common wrack as common bruit doth put it commend me to my loving countrymen commend me to them and tell them that to ease them of their griefs their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses their pangs of love with other incident throes that nature's fragile vessel doth sustain in life's uncertain voyage i will some kindness do them i'll teach them to prevent wild alcibiades' wrath i have a tree which grows here in my close that mine own use invites me to cut down and shortly must i fell it tell my friends tell athens in the sequence of degree from high to low throughout that whoso please to stop affliction let him take his haste come hither ere my tree hath felt the ax and hang himself i pray you do my greeting come not to me again but say to athens timon hath made his everlasting mansion upon the beach\u00e8d verge of the salt flood who once a day with his emboss\u00e8d froth the turbulent surge shall cover thither come and let my gravestone be your oracle lips let four words go by

thou art a cure fit for a king you're welcome most learn\u00e8d reverend sir into our kingdom use us and it my good lord have great care i be not found a talker we are busy go and once more in mine arms i bid him welcome and thank the holy conclave for their loves they have sent me such a man i would have wished for two equal men the queen shall be acquainted forthwith for what you come where's gardiner ay and the best she shall have and my favor to him that does best god forbid else cardinal prithee call gardiner to me my new secretary i find him a fit fellow come hither gardiner deliver this with modesty to th' queen the most convenient place that i can think of for such receipt of learning is blackfriars there you shall meet about this weighty business my wolsey see it furnished o my lord would it not grieve an able man to leave so sweet a bedfellow but conscience conscience o 'tis a tender place and i must leave her what's the need it hath already publicly been read and on all sides th' authority allowed you may then spare that time here call her again go thy ways kate that man i' th' world who shall report he has a better wife let him in naught be trusted for speaking false in that thou art alone  if thy rare qualities sweet gentleness thy meekness saintlike wifelike government obeying in commanding and thy parts sovereign and pious else could speak thee out  the queen of earthly queens she's noble born and like her true nobility she has carried herself towards me my lord cardinal i do excuse you yea upon mine honor i free you from 't you are not to be taught that you have many enemies that know not why they are so but like to village curs bark when their fellows do by some of these the queen is put in anger you're excused but will you be more justified you ever have wished the sleeping of this business never desired it to be stirred but oft have hindered oft the passages made toward it on my honor i speak my good lord cardinal to this point and thus far clear him now what moved me to 't i will be bold with time and your attention then mark th' inducement thus it came give heed to 't my conscience first received a tenderness scruple and prick on certain speeches uttered by th' bishop of bayonne then french ambassador who had been hither sent on the debating a marriage 'twixt the duke of orleans and our daughter mary i' th' progress of this business ere a determinate resolution he i mean the bishop did require a respite wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate respecting this our marriage with the dowager sometime our brother's wife this respite shook the bosom of my conscience entered me yea with a spitting power and made to tremble the region of my breast which forced such way that many mazed considerings did throng and pressed in with this caution first methought i stood not in the smile of heaven who had commanded nature that my lady's womb if it conceived a male child by me should do no more offices of life to 't than the grave does to th' dead for her male issue or died where they were made or shortly after this world had aired them hence i took a thought this was a judgment on me that my kingdom well worthy the best heir o' th' world should not be gladded in 't by me then follows that i weighed the danger which my realms stood in by this my issue's fail and that gave to me many a groaning throe thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience i did steer toward this remedy whereupon we are now present here together that's to say i meant to rectify my conscience which i then did feel full sick and yet not well by all the reverend fathers of the land and doctors learn\u00e8d first i began in private with you my lord of lincoln you remember how under my oppression i did reek when i first moved you i have spoke long be pleased yourself to say how far you satisfied me i then moved you my lord of canterbury and got your leave to make this present summons unsolicited i left no reverend person in this court but by particular consent proceeded under your hands and seals therefore go on for no dislike i' th' world against the person of the good queen but the sharp thorny points of my alleg\u00e8d reasons drives this forward prove but our marriage lawful by my life and kingly dignity we are contented to wear our mortal state to come with her katherine our queen before the primest creature that's paragoned o' th' world i may perceive these cardinals trifle with me i abhor this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome my learn\u00e8d and well belov\u00e8d servant cranmer prithee return with thy approach i know my comfort comes along break up the court i say set on what piles of wealth hath he accumulated to his own portion and what expense by th' hour seems to flow from him how i' th' name of thrift does he rake this together now my lords saw you the cardinal it may well be there is a mutiny in 's mind this morning papers of state he sent me to peruse as i required and wot you what i found there on my conscience put unwittingly  forsooth an inventory thus importing the several parcels of his plate his treasure rich stuffs and ornaments of household which i find at such proud rate that it outspeaks possession of a subject if we did think his contemplation were above the earth and fixed on spiritual object he should still dwell in his musings but i am afraid his thinkings are below the moon not worth his serious considering good my lord you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory of your best graces in your mind the which you were now running o'er you have scarce time to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span to keep your earthly audit sure in that i deem you an ill husband and am glad to have you therein my companion you have said well 'tis well said again and 'tis a kind of good deed to say well and yet words are no deeds my father loved you he said he did and with his deed did crown his word upon you since i had my office i have kept you next my heart have not alone employed you where high profits might come home but pared my present havings to bestow my bounties upon you have i not made you the prime man of the state i pray you tell me if what i now pronounce you have found true and if you may confess it say withal if you are bound to us or no what say you fairly answered a loyal and obedient subject is therein illustrated the honor of it does pay the act of it as i' th' contrary the foulness is the punishment i presume that as my hand has opened bounty to you my heart dropped love my power rained honor more on you than any so your hand and heart your brain and every function of your power should notwithstanding that your bond of duty as 'twere in love's particular be more to me your friend than any 'tis nobly spoken  take notice lords he has a loyal breast for you have seen him open 't read o'er this and after this and then to breakfast with what appetite you have charles i will play no

your patience to you and be well contented to make your house our tower you a brother of us it fits we thus proceed or else no witness would come against you stand up good canterbury thy truth and thy integrity is rooted in us thy friend give me thy hand stand up prithee let's walk now by my halidom what manner of man are you my lord i looked you would have given me your petition that i should have ta'en some pains to bring together yourself and your accusers and to have heard you without endurance further know you not how your state stands i' th' world with the whole world your enemies are many and not small their practices must bear the same proportion and not ever the justice and the truth o' th' question carries the due o' th' verdict with it at what ease might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt to swear against you such things have been done you are potently opposed and with a malice of as great size ween you of better luck i mean in perjured witness than your master whose minister you are whiles here he lived upon this naughty earth go to go to you take a precipice for no leap of danger and woo your own destruction be of good cheer they shall no more prevail than we

another 'tis well there's one above 'em yet i had thought they had parted so much honesty among 'em  at least good manners as not thus to suffer a man of his place and so near our favor to dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures and at the door too like a post with packets by holy mary butts there's knavery let 'em alone and draw the curtain close we shall hear more anon you were ever good at sudden commendations bishop of winchester but know i come not to hear such flattery now and in my presence they are too thin and base to hide offenses to me you cannot reach you play the spaniel and think with wagging of your tongue to win me but whatsoe'er thou tak'st me for i'm sure thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody  good man sit down now let me see the proudest he that dares most but wag his finger at thee by all that's holy he had better starve than but once think this place becomes thee not no sir it does not please me i had thought i had had men of some understanding

as you are why what a shame was this did my commission bid you so far forget yourselves i gave you power as he was a councillor to try him not as a groom there's some of you i see more out of malice

caesar's natural vice to hate our great competitor from alexandria this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy more womanly than he hardly gave audience or vouchsafed to think he had partners you shall find there a man who is th' abstract of all faults that all men follow you are too indulgent let's grant it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet with knaves that smells of sweat say this becomes him  as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemish yet must antony no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness if he filled his vacancy with his voluptuousness full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him for 't but to confound such time that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud as his own state and ours 'tis to be chid as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge pawn their experience to their present pleasure and so rebel to judgment i should have known no less it hath been taught us from the primal state that he which is was wished until he were and the ebbed man ne'er loved till ne'er worth love comes feared by being lacked this common body like to a vagabond flag upon the stream goes to

famine follow whom thou fought'st against though daintily brought up with patience more than savages could suffer thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets the barks of trees thou brows\u00e8d on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on and all this  it wounds thine honor that i speak it now  was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek so much as lanked not let his shames quickly drive him to rome 'tis time we twain did show ourselves i' th' field and to that end assemble we immediate council pompey thrives in our idleness till which encounter it is my business too farewell doubt not sir i knew it for my bond i do not know maecenas ask agrippa welcome to rome sit nay then i must be laughed at if or for nothing or a little i should say myself offended and with you chiefly i' th' world more laughed at that i should once name you derogately when to sound your name it not concerned me no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt yet if you there did practice on my state your being in egypt might be my question you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me your wife and brother made wars upon me and their contestation was theme for you you were the word of war you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patched up your excuses i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria you did pocket up my letters and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience you have broken the article of your oath which you shall never have tongue to charge me with to lend me arms and aid when i required them the which you both denied i do not much dislike the matter but the manner of his speech for 't cannot be we shall remain in friendship our conditions so diff'ring in their acts yet if i knew what hoop should hold us staunch from edge to edge o' th' world i would pursue it speak agrippa say not so agrippa if cleopatra heard you your reproof were well deserved of rashness not till he hears how antony is touched with what is spoke already the power of caesar and his power unto octavia there's my hand a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never fly off our loves again about the mount misena great and increasing but by sea he is an absolute master with most gladness and do invite you to my sister's view whither straight i'll lead you goodnight most meet that first we come to words and therefore have we our written purposes before us sent which if thou hast considered let us know if 'twill tie up thy discontented sword and carry back to sicily much tall youth that else must perish here take your time there's the point and what may follow to try a larger fortune that's our offer since i saw you last there's a change upon you that's the next to do show 's the way sir will this description satisfy him i could well forbear 't it's monstrous labor when i wash my brain and it grows fouler possess it i'll make answer but i had rather fast from all four days than drink so much in one cup us till the world go round cup us till the world go round what would you more pompey goodnight good brother let me request you off our graver business frowns at this levity gentle lords let's part you see we have burnt our cheeks strong enobarb is weaker than the wine and mine own tongue splits what it speaks the wild disguise hath almost anticked us all what needs more words goodnight good antony your hand you take from me a great part of myself use me well in 't sister prove such a wife as my thoughts make thee and as my farthest bond shall pass on thy approof most noble antony let not the piece of virtue which is set betwixt us as the cement of our love to keep it builded be the ram to batter the fortress of it for better might we have loved without this mean if on both parts this be not cherished i have said farewell my dearest sister fare thee well the elements be kind to thee and make thy spirits all of comfort fare thee well what octavia no sweet octavia you shall hear from me still the time shall not outgo my thinking on you adieu be happy farewell farewell contemning rome he has done all this and more in alexandria here's the manner of 't i' th' marketplace on a tribunal silvered cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned at the feet sat caesarion whom they call my father's son and all the unlawful issue that their lust since then hath made between them unto her he gave the stablishment of egypt made her of lower syria cyprus lydia absolute queen i' th' common showplace where they exercise his sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings great media parthia and armenia he gave to alexander to ptolemy he assigned syria cilicia and phoenicia she in th' habiliments of the goddess isis that day appeared and oft before gave audience as 'tis reported so the people knows it and have now received his accusations caesar and that having in sicily sextus pompeius spoiled we had not rated him his part o' th' isle then does he say he lent me some shipping unrestored lastly he frets that lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposed and being that we detain all his revenue 'tis done already and the messenger gone i have told him lepidus was grown too cruel that he his high authority abused and did deserve his change for what i have conquered i grant him part but then in his armenia and other of his conquered kingdoms i demand the like nor must not then be yielded to in this that ever i should call thee castaway why have you stol'n upon us thus you come not like caesar's sister the wife of antony should have an army for an usher and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear the trees by th' way should have borne men and expectation fainted longing for what it had not nay the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven raised by your populous troops but you are come a market maid to rome and have prevented the ostentation of our love which left unshown is often left unloved we should have met you by sea and land supplying every stage with an augmented greeting which soon he granted being an abstract 'tween his lust and him i have eyes upon him and his affairs come to me on the wind where is he now no my most wrong\u00e8d sister cleopatra hath nodded him to her he hath given his empire up to a whore who now are levying the kings o' th' earth for war he hath assembled bocchus the king of libya archelaus of cappadocia philadelphos king of paphlagonia the thracian king adallas king manchus of arabia king of pont herod of jewry mithridates king of comagen polemon and amyntas the kings of mede and lycaonia with a more larger list of scepters welcome hither your letters did withhold our breaking forth till we perceived both how you were wrong led and we in negligent danger cheer your heart be you not troubled with the time which drives o'er your content these strong necessities but let determined things to destiny hold unbewailed their way welcome to rome nothing more dear to me you are abused beyond the mark of thought and the high gods to do you justice makes his ministers of us and those that love you best of comfort and ever welcome to us most certain sister welcome pray you be ever known to patience my dear'st sister taurus strike not by land keep whole provoke not battle till we have done at sea do not exceed the prescript of this scroll our fortune lies upon this jump let him appear that's come from antony know you him approach and speak be 't so declare thine office for antony i have no ears to his request the queen of audience nor desire shall fail so she from egypt drive her all disgrac\u00e8d friend or take his life there this if she perform she shall not sue unheard so to them both bring him through the bands to try thy eloquence now 'tis time dispatch from antony win cleopatra promise and in our name what she requires add more from thine invention offers women are not in their best fortunes strong but want will perjure the ne'er touched vestal try thy cunning thidias make thine own edict for thy pains which we will answer as a law observe how antony becomes his flaw and what thou think'st his very action speaks in every power that moves he calls me boy and chides as he had power to beat me out of egypt my messenger he hath whipped with rods dares me to personal combat caesar to antony let the old ruffian know i have many other ways to die meantime laugh at his challenge let our best heads know that tomorrow the last of many battles we mean to fight within our files there are of those that served mark antony but late enough to fetch him in see it done and feast the army we have store to do 't and they have earned the waste poor antony go forth agrippa and begin the fight our will is antony be took alive make it so known the time of universal peace is near prove this a prosp'rous day the three nooked world shall bear the olive freely go charge agrippa plant those that have revolted in the vant that antony may seem to spend his fury upon himself but being charged we will be still by land  which as i take 't we shall for his best force is forth to man his galleys to the vales and hold our best advantage go to him dolabella bid him yield being so frustrate tell him he mocks the pauses that he makes wherefore is that and what art thou that dar'st appear thus to us what is 't thou say'st the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack the round world should have shook lions into civil streets and citizens to their dens the death of antony is not a single doom in the name lay a moiety of the world look you sad friends the gods rebuke me but it is tidings to wash the eyes of kings o antony i have followed thee to this but we do lance diseases in our bodies i must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day or look on thine we could not stall together in the whole world but yet let me lament with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts that thou my brother my competitor in top of all design my mate in empire friend and companion in the front of war the arm of mine own body and the heart where mine his thoughts did kindle that our stars unreconciliable should divide our equalness to this hear me good friends  but i will tell you at some meeter season the business of this man looks out of him we'll hear him what he says whence are you bid her have good heart she soon shall know of us by some of ours how honorable and how kindly we determine for her for caesar cannot live to be ungentle come hither proculeius go and say we purpose her no shame give her what comforts the quality of her passion shall require lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke she do defeat us for her life in rome would be eternal in our triumph go and with your speediest bring us what she says and how you find of her gallus go you along where's dolabella to second proculeius let him alone for i remember now how he's employed he shall in time be ready go with me to my tent where you shall see how hardly i was drawn into this war how calm and gentle i proceeded still in all my writings go with me and see what i can show in this which is the queen of egypt arise you shall not kneel i pray you rise rise egypt take to you no hard thoughts the record of what injuries you did us though written in our flesh we shall remember as things but done by chance cleopatra know we will extenuate rather than enforce if you apply yourself to our intents which towards you are most gentle you shall find a benefit in this change but if you seek to lay on me a cruelty by taking antony's course you shall bereave yourself of my good purposes and put your children to that destruction which i'll guard them from if thereon you rely i'll take my leave you shall advise me in all for cleopatra nay blush not cleopatra i approve your wisdom in the deed good queen let us entreat you  forbear seleucus cleopatra not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged put we i' th' roll of conquest still be 't yours bestow it at your pleasure and believe caesar's no merchant to make prize with you of things that merchants sold therefore be cheered make not your thoughts your prisons no dear queen for we intend so to dispose you as yourself shall give us counsel feed and sleep our care and pity is so much upon you that we remain your friend and so adieu not so adieu bravest at the last she leveled at our purposes and being royal took her own way the manner of their deaths i do not see them bleed poisoned then o noble weakness if they had swallowed poison 'twould appear by external swelling but she looks like sleep as she would catch another antony in her strong toil of grace most probable that so she died for her physician tells me she hath pursued conclusions infinite of easy ways to die take up her bed and bear her women from the monument she shall be buried by her antony no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous high events as these strike those that make them and their story is no less in pity than his glory which brought them to be lamented our army shall in solemn show

death a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks so foul a sky clears not without a storm pour down thy weather how goes all in france o where hath our intelligence been drunk where hath it slept where is my mother's care that such an army could be drawn in france and she not hear of it withhold thy speed dreadful occasion o make a league with me

hath murdered him i had a mighty cause to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him it is the curse of kings to be attended by slaves that take their humors for a warrant to break within the bloody house of life and on the winking of authority to understand a law to know the meaning of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns more upon humor than advised respect o when the last accompt twixt heaven and earth is to be made then shall this hand and seal witness against us to damnation how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by a fellow by the hand of nature marked quoted and signed to do a deed of shame this murder had not come into my mind but taking note of thy abhorred aspect finding thee fit for bloody villainy apt liable to be employed in danger i faintly broke with thee of arthur's death and thou to be endear\u00e8d to a king made it no conscience to destroy a prince hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause when i spake darkly what i purpos\u00e8d or turned an eye of doubt upon my face as bid me tell my tale in express words deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me but thou didst understand me by my signs and didst in signs again parley with sin yea without stop didst let thy heart consent and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed which both our tongues held vile to name out of my sight and never see me more my nobles leave me and my state is braved even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers nay in the body of this fleshly land this kingdom this confine of blood and breath hostility and civil tumult reigns between my conscience and my cousin's death doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers throw this report on their incens\u00e8d rage and make them tame to their obedience forgive the comment that my passion made upon thy feature for my rage was blind and foul imaginary eyes of blood presented thee more hideous than thou art o answer not but to my closet bring the angry lords with all expedient haste i conjure thee but slowly run more fast thus have i yielded up into your hand the circle of my glory now keep your holy word go meet the french and from his holiness use all your power to stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed our discontented counties do revolt our people quarrel with obedience swearing allegiance and the love of soul to stranger blood to foreign royalty this inundation of mistempered humor rests by you only to be qualified then pause not for the present time's so sick that present

fiend confined to tyrannize on unreprievable condemn\u00e8d blood o cousin thou art come to set mine eye the tackle of my heart is cracked and burnt and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail

looked upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i would change my humanity with a baboon virtue a fig 'tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts  whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favor with an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy purse  nor he his to her it was a violent commencement in her and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse these moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her thou art sure of me go make money i have told thee often and i retell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this tomorrow adieu at my lodging go to farewell do you hear roderigo no more of drowning do you hear go to farewell put money enough in your purse thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gained knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets 'has done my office i know not if 't be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety he holds me well the better shall my purpose work on him cassio's a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery how how let's see after some time to abuse othello's ear that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected framed to make women false the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so and will as tenderly be led by th' nose as asses are i have 't it is engendered hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light sir would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me you would have enough in faith too much i find it still when i have list to sleep marry before your ladyship i grant she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking come on come on you are pictures out of door bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens saints in your injuries devils being offended players in your huswifery and huswives in your beds nay it is true or else i am a turk you rise to play and go to bed to work no let me not o gentle lady do not put me to 't for i am nothing if not critical ay madam i am about it but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze it plucks out brains and all but my muse labors and thus she is delivered if she be fair and wise fairness and wit the one's for use the other useth it if she be black and thereto have a wit she'll find a white that shall her blackness hit she never yet was foolish that was fair for even her folly helped her to an heir there's none so foul and foolish thereunto but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do she that was ever fair and never proud had tongue at will and yet was never loud never lacked gold and yet went never gay fled from her wish and yet said now i may she that being angered her revenge being nigh bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod's head for the salmon's tail she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind see suitors following and not look behind she was a wight if ever such wight were  to suckle fools and chronicle small beer he takes her by the palm ay well said whisper with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship you say true 'tis so indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in very good well kissed an excellent courtesy 'tis so indeed yet again your fingers to your lips would they were clyster pipes for your sake the moor i know his trumpet o you are well tuned now but i'll set down the pegs that make this music as honest as i am do thou meet me presently at the harbor come hither if thou be'st valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first i must tell thee this desdemona is directly in love with him lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed mark me with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favor sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already blessed fig's end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark that lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together villainous thoughts roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise th' incorporate conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me i have brought you from venice watch you tonight for the command i'll lay 't upon you cassio knows you not i'll not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favorably minister sir he's rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell that cassio loves her i do well believe 't that she loves him 'tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think he'll prove to desdemona a most dear husband now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leaped into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am evened with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment cannot cure which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trace for his quick hunting stand the putting on i'll have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my nightcap too make the moor thank me love me and reward me for making him egregiously an ass and practicing upon his peace and quiet even to madness 'tis here but yet confused knavery's plain face is never seen till used not this hour lieutenant 'tis not yet ten o' th' clock our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for jove and i'll warrant her full of game what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley to provocation and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love well happiness to their sheets come lieutenant i have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello o they are our friends but one cup i'll drink for you what man 'tis a night of revels the gallants desire it here at the door i pray you call them in if i can fasten but one cup upon him with that which he hath drunk tonight already he'll be as full of quarrel and offense as my young mistress' dog now my sick fool roderigo whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out to desdemona hath tonight caroused potations pottle deep and he's to watch three else of cyprus noble swelling spirits that hold their honors in a wary distance the very elements of this warlike isle have i tonight flustered with flowing cups and they watch too now 'mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the isle but here they come if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely both with wind and stream some wine ho and let me the cannikin clink clink and let me the cannikin clink a soldier's a man o man's life's but a span why then let a soldier drink some wine boys i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting your dane your german and your swag bellied hollander drink ho are nothing to your english why he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled o sweet england king stephen was and a worthy peer his breeches cost him but a crown he held them sixpence all too dear with that he called the tailor lown he was a wight of high renown and thou art but of low degree 'tis pride that pulls the country down then take thy auld cloak about thee some wine ho will you hear 't again it's true good lieutenant and so do i too lieutenant you see this fellow that is gone before he's a soldier fit to stand by caesar and give direction and do but see his vice 'tis to his virtue a just equinox the one as long as th' other 'tis pity of him i fear the trust othello puts him in on some odd time of his infirmity will shake this island 'tis evermore the prologue to his sleep he'll watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle how now roderigo i pray you after the lieutenant go not i for this fair island i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evil but hark what noise away i say go out and cry a mutiny nay good lieutenant god's will gentlemen  help ho lieutenant sir montano sir  help masters here's a goodly watch indeed who's that which rings the bell diablo ho the town will rise god's will lieutenant hold you will be shamed forever hold ho lieutenant sir montano gentlemen  have you forgot all sense of place and duty hold the general speaks to you hold for shame i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom divesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and tilting one at other's breast in opposition bloody i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offense to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamor as it so fell out  the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i returned the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till tonight i ne'er might say before when i came back  for this was brief i found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass what are you hurt lieutenant marry god forbid as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and he's yours what was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to you is 't possible why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not so befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you you or any man living may be drunk at a time man i'll tell you what you shall do our general's wife is now the general i may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch and what's he then that says i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for 'tis most easy th' inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit she's framed as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moor were 't to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeem\u00e8d sin  his soul is so enfettered to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortune and she for him pleads strongly to the moor i'll pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her body's lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all how now roderigo how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time does 't not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashiered cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by th' mass 'tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short retire thee go where thou art billeted away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress i'll set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay that's the way dull not device by coldness and delay you have not been abed then i'll send her to you presently and i'll devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way that your converse and business may be more free well my good lord i'll do 't ha i like not that nothing my lord or if i know not what cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it that he would steal away so guiltylike seeing your coming my noble lord  did michael cassio when you wooed my lady know of your love but for a satisfaction of my thought no further harm i did not think he had been acquainted with her indeed honest my lord my lord for aught i know think my lord my lord you know i love you for michael cassio i dare be sworn i think that he is honest men should be what they seem or those that be not would they might seem none why then i think cassio's an honest man good my lord pardon me though i am bound to every act of duty i am not bound to that all slaves are free to utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false  as where's that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not who has that breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and law days and in sessions sit with meditations lawful i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guess  as i confess it is my nature's plague to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy shapes faults that are not that your wisdom from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty and wisdom to let you know my thoughts good name in man and woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash 'tis something nothing 'twas mine 'tis his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed you cannot if my heart were in your hand nor shall not whilst 'tis in my custody o beware my lord of jealousy it is the green eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger but o what damn\u00e8d minutes tells he o'er who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves poor and content is rich and rich enough but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor good god the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy i am glad of this for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore as i am bound receive it from me i speak not yet of proof look to your wife observe her well with cassio wear your eyes thus not jealous nor secure i would not have your free and noble nature out of self bounty be abused look to 't i know our country disposition well in venice they do let god see the pranks they dare not show their husbands their best conscience is not to leave 't undone but keep 't unknown she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seemed to shake and fear your looks she loved them most why go to then she that so young could give out such a seeming to seel her father's eyes up close as oak he thought 'twas witchcraft but i am much to blame i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you i see this hath a little dashed your spirits i' faith i fear it has i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love but i do see you're moved i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion should you do so my lord my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aim not at cassio's my worthy friend my lord i see you're moved long live she so and long live you to think so ay there's the point as to be bold with you not to affect many propos\u00e8d matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends  foh one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproportion thoughts unnatural  but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her though i may fear her will recoiling to her better judgment may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent my lord i take my leave my lord i would i might entreat your honor to scan this thing no farther leave it to time although 'tis fit that cassio have his place  for sure he fills it up with great ability  yet if you please to hold him off awhile you shall by that perceive him and his means note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity much will be seen in that in the meantime let me be thought too busy in my fears  as worthy cause i have to fear i am  and hold her free i do beseech your honor i once more take my leave how now what do you here alone you have a thing for me it is a common thing  to have a foolish wife what handkerchief hast stol'n it from her a good wench give it me why what is that to you be not acknown on 't i have use for it go leave me i will in cassio's lodging lose this napkin and let him find it trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ this may do something the moor already changes with my poison dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons which at the first are scarce found to distaste but with a little act upon the blood burn like the mines of sulfur i did say so look where he comes not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday why how now general no more of that how now my lord i am sorry to hear this is 't possible my lord is 't come to this my noble lord  o grace o heaven forgive me are you a man have you a soul or sense god b' wi' you take mine office o wretched fool that liv'st to make thine honesty a vice  o monstrous world take note take note o world to be direct and honest is not safe  i thank you for this profit and from hence i'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense i should be wise for honesty's a fool and loses that it works for i see you are eaten up with passion i do repent me that i put it to you you would be satisfied and may but how how satisfied my lord would you the supervisor grossly gape on behold her topped it were a tedious difficulty i think to bring them to that prospect damn them then if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own what then how then what shall i say where's satisfaction it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk but yet i say if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction you might have 't i do not like the office but sith i am entered in this cause so far pricked to 't by foolish honesty and love i will go on i lay with cassio lately and being troubled with a raging tooth i could not sleep there are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs one of this kind is cassio in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona let us be wary let us hide our loves and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand cry o sweet creature then kiss me hard as if he plucked up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips then laid his leg o'er my thigh and sighed and kissed and then cried curs\u00e8d fate that gave thee to the moor nay this was but his dream and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly nay but be wise yet we see nothing done she may be honest yet tell me but this have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand i know not that but such a handkerchief  i am sure it was your wife's did i today see cassio wipe his beard with if it be that or any that was hers it speaks against her with the other proofs yet be content patience i say your mind perhaps may change do not rise yet witness you ever burning lights above you elements that clip us round about witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit hands heart to wronged othello's service let him command and to obey shall be in me remorse what bloody business ever my friend is dead 'tis done at your request but let her live i am your own forever there is no other way 'tis she must do 't and lo the happiness go and importune her is my lord angry can he be angry i have seen the cannon when it hath blown his ranks into the air and like the devil from his very arm puffed his own brother and is he angry something of moment then i will go meet him there's matter in 't indeed if he be angry will you think so what to kiss in private or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more not meaning any harm if they do nothing 'tis a venial slip but if i give my wife a handkerchief  why then 'tis hers my lord and being hers she may i think bestow 't on any man her honor is an essence that's not seen they have it very oft that have it not but for the handkerchief  ay what of that what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong or heard him say as knaves be such abroad who having by their own importunate suit or voluntary dotage of some mistress convinc\u00e8d or supplied them cannot choose but they must blab  he hath my lord but be you well assured no more than he'll unswear faith that he did i know not what he did lie  with her on her what you will work on my medicine work thus credulous fools are caught and many worthy and chaste dames even thus all guiltless meet reproach what ho my lord my lord i say othello how now cassio my lord is fall'n into an epilepsy this is his second fit he had one yesterday no forbear the lethargy must have his quiet course if not he foams at mouth and by and by breaks out to savage madness look he stirs do you withdraw yourself a little while he will recover straight when he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you how is it general have you not hurt your head i mock you not by heaven would you would bear your fortune like a man there's many a beast then in a populous city and many a civil monster good sir be a man think every bearded fellow that's but yoked may draw with you there's millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds which they dare swear peculiar your case is better o 'tis the spite of hell the fiend's arch mock to lip a wanton in a secure couch and to suppose her chaste no let me know and knowing what i am i know what she shall be stand you awhile apart confine yourself but in a patient list whilst you were here o'erwhelm\u00e8d with your grief  a passion most unsuiting such a man  cassio came hither i shifted him away and laid good 'scuses upon your ecstasy bade him anon return and here speak with me the which he promised do but encave yourself and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns that dwell in every region of his face for i will make him tell the tale anew  where how how oft how long ago and when he hath and is again to cope your wife i say but mark his gesture marry patience or i shall say you're all in all in spleen and nothing of a man that's not amiss but yet keep time in all will you withdraw now will i question cassio of bianca a huswife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature that dotes on cassio as 'tis the strumpet's plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one he when he hears of her cannot restrain from the excess of laughter here he comes as he shall smile othello shall go mad and his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassio's smiles gestures and light behaviors quite in the wrong how do you lieutenant ply desdemona well and you are sure on 't now if this suit lay in bianca's power how quickly should you speed i never knew woman love man so do you hear cassio she gives it out that you shall marry her do you intend it faith the cry goes that you marry her i am a very villain else before me look where she comes after her after her will you sup there well i may chance to see you for i would very fain speak with you go to say no more did you perceive how he laughed at his vice and did you see the handkerchief yours by this hand and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife she gave it him and he hath giv'n it his whore nay you must forget that nay that's not your way she's the worse for all this ay too gentle if you are so fond over her iniquity give her patent to offend for if it touch not you it comes near nobody o 'tis foul in her that's fouler do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even the bed she hath contaminated and for cassio let me be his undertaker you shall hear more by midnight i warrant something from venice 'tis lodovico this comes from the duke see your wife's with him i am very glad to see you signior welcome to cyprus lives sir he is much changed he's that he is i may not breathe my censure what he might be if what he might he is not i would to heaven he were 'faith that was not so well yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst alas alas it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known you shall observe him and his own courses will denote him so that i may save my speech do but go after and mark how he continues what is your pleasure madam how is 't with you what is the matter lady what name fair lady why did he so do not weep do not weep alas the day beshrew him for 't how comes this trick upon him fie there is no such man it is impossible speak within door you are a fool go to i pray you be content 'tis but his humor the business of the state does him offense and he does chide with you it is but so i warrant hark how these instruments summon to supper the messengers of venice stays the meat go in and weep not all things shall be well how now roderigo what in the contrary will you hear me roderigo you charge me most unjustly well go to very well very well you have said now why now i see there's mettle in thee and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before give me thy hand roderigo thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet i protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair i grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment but roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which i have greater reason to believe now than ever i mean purpose courage and valor this night show it if thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life sir there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othello's place o no he goes into mauritania and takes away with him the fair desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of cassio why by making him uncapable of othello's place knocking out his brains ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right he sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will i go to him he knows not yet of his honorable fortune if you will watch his going thence which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your pleasure i will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall between us come stand not amazed at it but go along with me i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him it is now high supper time and the night grows to waste about it and you shall be satisfied here stand behind this bulk straight will he come wear thy good rapier bare and put it home quick quick fear nothing i'll be at thy elbow it makes us or it mars us think on that and fix most firm thy resolution here at thy hand be bold and take thy stand i have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense and he grows angry now whether he kill cassio or cassio him or each do kill the other every way makes my gain live roderigo he calls me to a restitution large of gold and jewels that i bobbed from him as gifts to desdemona it must not be if cassio

o cressid how often have i wished me thus what should they grant what makes this pretty abruption what too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love fears make devils of cherubins they never see truly o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupid's pageant there is presented no monster nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confined that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit are there such such are not we praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present we will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble few words to fair faith troilus shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer than troilus you know now your hostages your uncle's word and my firm faith why was my cressid then so hard to win and shall albeit sweet music issues thence your leave sweet cressid what offends you lady you cannot shun yourself well know they what they speak that speak so wisely o that i thought it could be in a woman  as if it can i will presume in you  to feed for aye her lamp and flames of love to keep her constancy in plight and youth outliving beauty's outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays or that persuasion could but thus convince me that my integrity and truth to you might be affronted with the match and weight of such a winnowed purity in love how were i then uplifted but alas i am as true as truth's simplicity and simpler than the infancy of truth o virtuous fight when right with right wars who shall be most right true swains in love shall in the world to come approve their truth by troilus when their rhymes full of protest of oath and big compare wants similes truth tired with iteration  as true as steel as plantage to the moon as sun to day as turtle to her mate as iron to adamant as earth to th' center  yet after all comparisons of truth as truth's authentic author to be cited as true as troilus shall crown up the verse and sanctify the numbers amen dear trouble not yourself the morn is cold trouble him not to bed to bed sleep kill those pretty eyes and give as soft attachment to thy senses as infants' empty of all thought i prithee now to bed o cressida but that the busy day waked by the lark hath roused the ribald crows and dreaming night will hide our joys no longer i would not from thee beshrew the witch with venomous wights she stays as tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love with wings more momentary swift than thought you will catch cold and curse me it is your uncle ha ha how now what's the matter is it so concluded how my achievements mock me i will go meet them and my lord aeneas we met by chance you did not find me here walk into her house i'll bring her to the grecian presently and to his hand when i deliver her think it an altar and thy brother troilus a priest there off'ring to it his own heart cressid i love thee in so strained a purity that the blest gods as angry with my fancy  more bright in zeal than the devotion which cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me a hateful truth from troy and troilus and suddenly where injury of chance puts back leave taking jostles roughly by all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips of all rejoindure forcibly prevents our locked embrasures strangles our dear vows even in the birth of our own laboring breath we two that with so many thousand sighs did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves with the rude brevity and discharge of one injurious time now with a robber's haste crams his rich thiev'ry up he knows not how as many farewells as be stars in heaven with distinct breath and consigned kisses to them he fumbles up into a loose adieu and scants us with a single famished kiss distasted with the salt of broken tears hark you are called some say the genius cries so to him that instantly must die  bid them have patience she shall come anon no remedy hear me my love be thou but true of heart  nay we must use expostulation kindly for it is parting from us i speak not be thou true as fearing thee for i will throw my glove to death himself that there is no maculation in thy heart but be thou true say i to fashion in my sequent protestation be thou true and i will see thee and i'll grow friend with danger wear this sleeve i will corrupt the grecian sentinels to give thee nightly visitation but yet be true hear why i speak it love the grecian youths are full of quality their loving well composed with gift of nature flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise how novelty may move and parts with person alas a kind of godly jealousy  which i beseech you call a virtuous sin  makes me afeard die i a villain then in this i do not call your faith in question so mainly as my merit i cannot sing nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk nor play at subtle games fair virtues all to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant but i can tell that in each grace of these there lurks a still and dumb discursive devil that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted no but something may be done that we will not and sometimes we are devils to ourselves when we will tempt the frailty of our powers presuming on their changeful potency come kiss and let us part good brother come you hither and bring aeneas and the grecian with you who i alas it is my vice my fault whiles others fish with craft for great opinion i with great truth catch mere simplicity whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns with truth and plainness i do wear mine bare fear not my truth the moral of my wit is plain and true there's all the reach of it welcome sir diomed here is the lady which for antenor we deliver you at the port lord i'll give her to thy hand and by the way possess thee what she is entreat her fair and by my soul fair greek if e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword name cressid and thy life shall be as safe as priam is in ilium grecian thou dost not use me courteously to shame the zeal of my petition to thee in praising her i tell thee lord of greece she is as far high soaring o'er thy praises as thou unworthy to be called her servant i charge thee use her well even for my charge for by the dreadful pluto if thou dost not though the great bulk achilles be thy guard i'll cut thy throat come to the port i'll tell thee diomed this brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head  lady give me your hand and as we walk to our own selves bend we our needful talk hector thou sleep'st awake thee my lord ulysses tell me i beseech you in what place of the field doth calchas keep shall i sweet lord be bound to you so much after we part from agamemnon's tent to bring me thither o sir to such as boasting show their scars a mock is due will you walk on my lord she was beloved she loved she is and doth but still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth sweet sir you honor me cressid comes forth to him yea so familiar what should she remember hold patience thy better must o plague and madness behold i pray you i prithee stay i pray you stay by hell and all hell's torments i will not speak a word doth that grieve thee o withered truth by jove i will be patient she strokes his cheek nay stay by jove i will not speak a word there is between my will and all offenses a guard of patience stay a little while fear me not my lord i will not be myself nor have cognition of what i feel i am all patience o beauty where is thy faith i will be patient outwardly i will i did swear patience wert thou the devil and wor'st it on thy horn it should be challenged nor i by pluto but that that likes not you pleases me best it is to make a recordation to my soul of every syllable that here was spoke but if i tell how these two did co act shall i not lie in publishing a truth sith yet there is a credence in my heart an esperance so obstinately strong that doth invert th' attest of eyes and ears as if those organs had deceptious functions created only to calumniate was cressid here she was not sure why my negation hath no taste of madness let it not be believed for womanhood think we had mothers do not give advantage to stubborn critics apt without a theme for depravation to square the general sex by cressid's rule rather think this not cressid nothing at all unless that this were she this she no this is diomed's cressida if beauty have a soul this is not she if souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies if sanctimony be the gods' delight if there be rule in unity itself this is not she o madness of discourse that cause sets up with and against itself bifold authority where reason can revolt without perdition and loss assume all reason without revolt this is and is not cressid within my soul there doth conduce a fight of this strange nature that a thing inseparate divides more wider than the sky and earth and yet the spacious breadth of this division admits no orifex for a point as subtle as ariachne's broken woof to enter instance o instance strong as pluto's gates cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven instance o instance strong as heaven itself the bonds of heaven are slipped dissolved and loosed and with another knot five finger tied the fractions of her faith orts of her love the fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics of her o'er eaten faith are given to diomed ay greek and that shall be divulg\u00e8d well in characters as red as mars his heart inflamed with venus never did young man fancy with so eternal and so fixed a soul hark greek as much as i do cressid love so much by weight hate i her diomed that sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm were it a casque composed by vulcan's skill my sword should bite it not the dreadful spout which shipmen do the hurricano call constringed in mass by the almighty sun shall dizzy with more clamor neptune's ear in his descent than shall my prompted sword falling on diomed o cressid o false cressid false false false let all untruths stand by thy stain\u00e8d name and they'll seem glorious have with you prince my courteous lord adieu  farewell revolted fair and diomed stand fast and wear a castle on thy head accept distracted thanks brother you have a vice of mercy in you which better fits a lion than a man when many times the captive grecian falls even in the fan and wind of your fair sword you bid them rise and live fool's play by heaven hector for th' love of all the gods let's leave the hermit pity with our mother and when we have our armors buckled on the venomed vengeance ride upon our swords spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth hector then 'tis wars who should withhold me not fate obedience nor the hand of mars beck'ning with fiery truncheon my retire not priamus and hecuba on knees their eyes o'er gall\u00e8d with recourse of tears nor you my brother with your true sword drawn opposed to hinder me should stop my way but by my ruin this foolish dreaming superstitious girl makes all these bodements away away they are at it hark proud diomed believe i come to lose my arm or win my sleeve what now let me read words words mere words no matter from the heart th' effect doth operate another way go wind to wind there turn and change together my love with words and errors still she feeds but edifies another with her deeds fly not for shouldst thou take the river styx i would swim after o traitor diomed turn thy false face thou traitor and pay the life thou owest me for my horse come both you cogging greeks have at you both ajax hath ta'en aeneas shall it be no by the flame of yonder glorious heaven he shall not carry him i'll be ta'en too or bring him off fate hear me what i say i reck not though i end my life today hector is slain he's dead and at the murderer's horse's tail in beastly sort dragged through the shameful field frown on you heavens effect your rage with speed sit gods upon your thrones and smite at troy i say at once let your brief plagues be mercy and linger not our sure destructions on you understand me not that tell me so i do not speak of flight of fear of death but dare all imminence that gods and men address their dangers in hector is gone who shall tell priam so or hecuba let him that will a screech owl aye be called go into troy and say their hector's dead there is a word will priam turn to stone make wells and niobes of the maids and wives cold statues of the youth and in a word scare troy out of itself but march away hector is dead there is no more to say stay yet you vile abominable tents thus proudly pitched upon our phrygian plains let titan rise as early as he dare i'll through and through you and thou great sized coward no space of earth shall sunder our two hates i'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still that moldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts strike a free march

till he had melted from the smallness of a gnat to air and then have turned mine eye and wept but good pisanio when shall we hear from him i did not take my leave of him but had most pretty things to say ere i could tell him how i would think on him at certain hours such thoughts and such or i could make him swear the shes of italy should not betray mine interest and his honor or have charged him at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight t' encounter me with orisons for then i am in heaven for him or ere i could give him that parting kiss which i had set betwixt two charming words comes in

must not in haste abuse if it be true how should i be revenged what ho pisanio away i do condemn mine ears that have so long attended thee if thou wert honorable thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not for such an end thou seek'st as base as strange thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far from thy report as thou from honor and solicits here a lady that disdains thee and the devil alike what ho pisanio  the king my father shall be made acquainted of thy assault if he shall think it fit a saucy stranger in his court to mart as in a romish stew and to expound his beastly mind to us he hath a court he little cares for and a daughter who he not respects at all what ho pisanio you make amends all's well sir take my power i' th' court for yours pray what is 't willingly and pawn mine

discourtesy to your best kindness one of your great knowing should learn being taught forbearance fools are not mad folks as i am mad i do if you'll be patient i'll no more be mad that cures us both i am much sorry sir you put me to forget a lady's manners by being so verbal and learn now for all that i which know my heart do here pronounce by th' very truth of it i care not for you and am so near the lack of charity to accuse myself i hate you which i had rather you felt than make 't my boast profane fellow wert thou the son of jupiter and no more but what thou art besides thou wert too base to be his groom thou wert dignified enough even to the point of envy if 'twere made comparative for your virtues to be styled the under hangman of his kingdom and hated for being preferred so well he never can meet more mischance than come to be but named of thee his mean'st garment that ever hath but clipped his body is dearer in my respect than all the hairs above thee were they all made such men how now pisanio to dorothy my woman hie thee presently i am sprighted with a fool frighted and angered worse go bid my woman search for a jewel that too casually hath left mine arm it was thy master's shrew me if i would lose it for a revenue of any king's in europe i do think i saw 't this morning confident i am last night 'twas on mine arm i kissed it i hope it be not gone to tell my lord that i kiss aught but he i hope so go and search ay i said so sir if you will make 't an action call witness to 't your mother too she's my good lady and will conceive i hope but the worst of me so i leave you sir to th' worst of discontent how now pisanio who thy lord that is my lord leonatus o learned indeed were that astronomer that knew the stars as i his characters he'd lay the future open you good gods let what is here contained relish of love of my lord's health of his content yet not that we two are asunder let that grieve him some griefs are med'cinable that is one of them for it doth physic love of his content all but in that good wax thy leave blest be you bees that make these locks of counsel lovers and men in dangerous bonds pray not alike though forfeiters you cast in prison yet you clasp young cupid's tables good news gods justice and your father's wrath should he take me in his dominion could not be so cruel to me as you o the dearest of creatures would even renew me with your eyes take notice that i am in cambria at milford haven what your own love will out of this advise you follow so he wishes you all happiness that remains loyal to his vow and your increasing in love leonatus posthumus o for a horse with wings hear'st thou pisanio he is at milford haven read and tell me how far 'tis thither if one of mean affairs may plod it in a week why may not i glide thither in a day then true pisanio who long'st like me to see thy lord who long'st  o let me bate but not like me yet long'st but in a fainter kind o not like me for mine's beyond beyond say and speak thick  love's counselor should fill the bores of hearing to th' smothering of the sense how far it is to this same bless\u00e8d milford and by th' way tell me how wales was made so happy as t' inherit such a haven but first of all how we may steal from hence and for the gap that we shall make in time from our hence going and our return to excuse but first how get hence why should excuse be born or ere begot we'll talk of that hereafter prithee speak how many score of miles may we well rid 'twixt hour and hour why one that rode to 's execution man could never go so slow i have heard of riding wagers where horses have been nimbler than the sands that run i' th' clock's behalf but this is fool'ry go bid my woman feign a sickness say she'll home to her father and provide me presently a riding suit no costlier than would fit a franklin's huswife i see before me man nor here nor here nor what ensues but have a fog in them that i cannot look through away i prithee do as i bid thee there's no more to say accessible is none but milford way thou told'st me when we came from horse the place was near at hand ne'er longed my mother so to see me first as i have now pisanio man where is posthumus what is in thy mind that makes thee stare thus wherefore breaks that sigh from th' inward of thee one but painted thus would be interpreted a thing perplexed beyond self explication put thyself into a havior of less fear ere wildness vanquish my staider senses what's the matter why tender'st thou that paper to me with a look untender if 't be summer news smile to 't before if winterly thou need'st but keep that count'nance still my husband's hand that drug damned italy hath out craftied him and he's at some hard point speak man thy tongue may take off some extremity which to read would be even mortal to me thy mistress pisanio hath played the strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lies bleeding in me i speak not out of weak surmises but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as i expect my revenge that part thou pisanio must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers let thine own hands take away her life i shall give thee opportunity at milford haven she hath my letter for the purpose where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done thou art the pander to her dishonor and equally to me disloyal false to his bed what is it to be false to lie in watch there and to think on him to weep 'twixt clock and clock if sleep charge nature to break it with a fearful dream of him and cry myself awake that's false to 's bed is it i false thy conscience witness iachimo thou didst accuse him of incontinency thou then looked'st like a villain now methinks thy favor's good enough some jay of italy whose mother was her painting hath betrayed him poor i am stale a garment out of fashion and for i am richer than to hang by th' walls i must be ripped to pieces with me o men's vows are women's traitors all good seeming by thy revolt o husband shall be thought put on for villainy not born where 't grows but worn a bait for ladies true honest men being heard like false aeneas were in his time thought false and sinon's weeping did scandal many a holy tear took pity from most true wretchedness so thou posthumus wilt lay the leaven on all proper men goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured from thy great fail come fellow be thou honest do thou thy master's bidding when thou seest him a little witness my obedience look i draw the sword myself take it and hit the innocent mansion of my love my heart fear not 'tis empty of all things but grief thy master is not there who was indeed the riches of it do his bidding strike thou mayst be valiant in a better cause but now thou seem'st a coward why i must die and if i do not by thy hand thou art no servant of thy master's against self slaughter there is a prohibition so divine that cravens my weak hand come here's my heart  something's afore 't soft soft we'll no defense  obedient as the scabbard what is here the scriptures of the loyal leonatus all turned to heresy away away corrupters of my faith you shall no more be stomachers to my heart thus may poor fools believe false teachers though those that are betrayed do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor stands in worse case of woe and thou posthumus that didst set up my disobedience 'gainst the king my father and make me put into contempt the suits of princely fellows shalt hereafter find it is no act of common passage but a strain of rareness and i grieve myself to think when thou shalt be disedged by her that now thou tirest on how thy memory will then be panged by me prithee dispatch the lamb entreats the butcher where's thy knife thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding when i desire it too do 't and to bed then wherefore then didst undertake it why hast thou abused so many miles with a pretense this place mine action and thine own our horses' labor the time inviting thee the perturbed court for my being absent whereunto i never purpose return why hast thou gone so far to be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand th' elected deer before thee talk thy tongue weary speak i have heard i am a strumpet and mine ear therein false struck can take no greater wound nor tent to bottom that but speak most like bringing me here to kill me some roman courtesan why good fellow what shall i do the while where bide how live or in my life what comfort when i am dead to my husband no court no father nor no more ado with that harsh noble simple nothing that cloten whose love suit hath been to me as fearful as a siege where then hath britain all the sun that shines day night are they not but in britain i' th' world's volume our britain seems as of it but not in 't in a great pool a swan's nest prithee think there's livers out of britain o for such means though peril to my modesty not death on 't i would adventure nay be brief i see into thy end and am almost a man already thou art all the comfort the gods will diet me with prithee away there's more to be considered but we'll even all that good time will give us this attempt i am soldier to and will abide it with a prince's courage away i prithee amen i thank thee i see a man's life is a tedious one i have tired myself and for two nights together have made the ground my bed i should be sick but that my resolution helps me milford when from the mountain top pisanio showed thee thou wast within a ken o jove i think foundations fly the wretched such i mean where they should be relieved two beggars told me i could not miss my way will poor folks lie that have afflictions on them knowing 'tis a punishment or trial yes no wonder when rich ones scarce tell true to lapse in fullness is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood is worse in kings than beggars my dear lord thou art one o' th' false ones now i think on thee my hunger's gone but even before i was at point to sink for food but what is this here is a path to 't 'tis some savage hold i were best not call i dare not call yet famine ere clean it o'erthrow nature makes it valiant plenty and peace breeds cowards hardness ever of hardiness is mother ho who's here if anything that's civil speak if savage take or lend ho no answer then i'll enter best draw my sword an if mine enemy but fear the sword like me he'll scarcely look on 't such a foe good heavens good masters harm me not before i entered here i called and thought to have begged or bought what i have took good troth i have stol'n naught nor

angry know if you kill me for my fault i should have died had i not made it to milford haven fidele sir i have a kinsman who is bound for italy he embarked at milford to whom being going almost spent with hunger i am fall'n in this offense 'mongst friends if brothers would it had been so that they had been my father's sons then had my prize been less and so more equal ballasting to thee posthumus

the world this bloody man the care on 't i hope i dream for so i thought i was a cave keeper and cook to honest creatures but 'tis not so 'twas but a bolt of nothing shot at nothing which the brain makes of fumes our very eyes are sometimes like our judgments blind good faith i tremble still with fear but if there be yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity as a wren's eye feared gods a part of it the dream's here still even when i wake it is without me as within me not imagined felt a headless man the garments of posthumus i know the shape of 's leg this is his hand his foot mercurial

wounding his belief in her renown with tokens thus and thus averring notes of chamber hanging pictures this her bracelet  o cunning how i got it nay some marks of secret on her person that he could not but think her bond of chastity quite cracked i having ta'en the forfeit whereupon  methinks i see him now  i am down again but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee as then your force did take

catch a saint with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet with all her double vigor art and nature once stir my temper but this virtuous maid subdues me quite ever till now when men were fond i smiled and wondered how when i would pray and think i think and pray to several subjects heaven hath my empty words whilst my invention hearing not my tongue anchors on isabel god in my mouth as if i did but only chew his name and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception the state whereon i studied is like a good thing being often read grown sere and tedious yea my gravity wherein let no man hear me i take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain o place o form how often dost thou with thy case thy habit wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming blood thou art blood let's write good angel on the devil's horn 'tis not the devil's crest how now who's there teach her the way o heavens why does my blood thus muster to my heart making both it unable for itself and dispossessing all my other parts of necessary fitness so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons come all to help him and so stop the air by which he should revive and even so the general subject to a well wished king quit their own part and in obsequious

not of your soul our compelled sins stand more for number than for accompt nay i'll not warrant that for i can speak against the thing i say answer to this i now the voice of the recorded law pronounce a sentence on your brother's life might there not be a charity in sin to save this brother's life pleased you to do 't at peril of your soul were equal poise of sin and charity nay but hear me your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant or seem so crafty and that's not good thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright when it doth tax itself as these black masks proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder than beauty could displayed but mark me to be receiv\u00e8d plain i'll speak more gross your brother is to die and his offense is so as it appears accountant to the law upon that pain admit no other way to save his life  as i subscribe not that nor any other  but in the loss of question that you his sister finding yourself desired of such a person whose credit with the judge or own great place could fetch your brother from the manacles of the law and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed or else to let him suffer what would you do then must your brother die were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slandered so you seemed of late to make the law a tyrant and rather proved the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice we are all frail nay women are frail too i think it well and from this testimony of your own sex since i suppose we are made to be no stronger than faults may shake our frames let me be bold i do arrest your words be that you are  that is a woman if you be more you're none if you be one as you are well expressed by all external

begun and now i give my sensual race the rein fit thy consent to my sharp appetite lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will or else he must not only die the death but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to ling'ring sufferance answer me tomorrow or by the affection that now guides me most i'll prove a tyrant to him as for you say what you can my false o'erweighs your true in most uneven and distracted manner his actions show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted and why meet him at the gates and deliver our authorities there and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the street well i beseech you let it be proclaimed betimes i' th' morn i'll call you at your house give notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet him good night this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant and dull to all proceedings a deflowered maid and by an eminent body that enforced the law against it but that her tender shame will not proclaim against her maiden loss how might she tongue me yet reason dares her no for my authority bears of a credent bulk that no particular scandal once can touch but it confounds the breather he should have lived save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense might in the times to come have ta'en revenge by so receiving a dishonored life with ransom of such shame would yet he had lived alack when once our grace we have forgot nothing goes right we would and we would not happy return be to your royal grace you make my bonds still greater my lord her wits i fear me are not firm she hath been a suitor to me for her brother cut off by course of

speech of marriage betwixt myself and her which was broke off partly for that her promis\u00e8d proportions came short of composition but in chief for that her reputation was disvalued in levity since which time of five years i never spake with her saw her nor heard from her upon my faith and honor i did but smile till now now good my lord give me the scope of justice my patience here is touched i do perceive these poor informal women are no more but instruments of some more mightier member that sets them on let me have way my lord to find this practice out what can you vouch against him

childhood of our joy with blood removed but little from her own where is she and how doth she and what says my concealed lady to our canceled love as if that name shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her as that name's curs\u00e8d hand murdered her kinsman o tell me friar tell me in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name lodge tell me that i may sack the hateful mansion do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide how well my comfort is revived by this but that a joy past joy calls out on me it were a grief so brief to part with thee farewell it was the lark the herald of the morn no nightingale look love what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east night's candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops i must be gone and live or stay and die let me be ta'en let me be put to death i am content so thou wilt have it so i'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye 'tis but the pale reflex of cynthia's brow nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads i have more care to stay than will to go come death and welcome juliet wills it so how is 't my soul let's talk it is not day more light and light more dark and dark our woes farewell farewell one kiss and i'll descend farewell i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings love to thee i doubt it not and all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come and trust me love in my eye so do you dry sorrow drinks our blood adieu adieu if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep my dreams presage some joyful news at hand my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts i dreamt my lady came and found me dead strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor ah me how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadows are so rich in joy news from verona how now balthasar dost thou not bring me letters from the friar how doth my lady is my father well how doth my juliet that i ask again for nothing can be ill if she be well is it e'en so then i deny you stars  thou knowest my lodging get me ink and paper and hire post horses i will hence tonight tush thou art deceived leave me and do the thing i bid thee do hast thou no letters to me from the friar no matter get thee gone and hire those horses i'll be with thee straight well juliet i will lie with thee tonight let's see for means o mischief thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men i do remember an apothecary and hereabouts he dwells which late i noted in tattered weeds with overwhelming brows culling of simples meager were his looks sharp misery had worn him to the bones and in his needy shop a tortoise hung an alligator stuffed and other skins of ill shaped fishes and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses were thinly scattered to make up a show noting this penury to myself i said an if a man did need a poison now whose sale is present death in mantua here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him o this same thought did but forerun my need and this same needy man must sell it me as i remember this should be the house being holiday the beggar's shop is shut  what ho apothecary come hither man i see that thou art poor hold there is forty ducats let me have a dram of poison such soon speeding gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the life weary taker may fall dead and that the trunk may be discharged of breath as violently as hasty powder fired doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb art thou so bare and full of wretchedness and fearest to die famine is in thy cheeks need and oppression starveth in thy eyes contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back the world is not thy friend nor the world's law the world affords no law to make thee rich then be not poor but break it and take this i pay thy poverty and not thy will there is thy gold worse poison to men's souls doing more murder in this loathsome world than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh come cordial and not poison go with me to juliet's grave for there must i use thee give me that mattock and the wrenching iron hold take this letter early in the morning see thou deliver it to my lord and father give me the light upon thy life i charge thee whate'er thou hearest or seest stand all aloof and do not interrupt me in my course why i descend into this bed of death is partly to behold my lady's face but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger a precious ring a ring that i must use in dear employment therefore hence begone but if thou jealous dost return to pry in what i farther shall intend to do by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs the time and my intents are savage wild more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea so shalt thou show me friendship take thou that live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow thou detestable maw thou womb of death gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open and in despite i'll cram thee with more food i must indeed and therefore came i hither good gentle youth tempt not a desp'rate man fly hence and leave me think upon these gone let them affright thee i beseech thee youth put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury o begone by heaven i love thee better than myself for i come hither armed against myself stay not begone live and hereafter say a madman's mercy bid thee run away wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy in faith i will let me peruse this face mercutio's kinsman noble county paris what said my man when my betoss\u00e8d soul did not attend him as we rode i think he told me paris should have married juliet said he not so or did i dream it so or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet to think it was so o give me thy hand one writ with me in sour misfortune's book i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave  a grave o no a lantern slaughtered youth for here lies juliet and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light  death lie thou there by a dead man interred how oft when men are at the point of death have they been merry which their keepers call a light'ning before death o how may i call this a light'ning o my love my wife death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty thou art not conquered beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks and death's pale flag is not advanc\u00e8d there  tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet o what more favor can i do to thee than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy forgive me cousin ah dear juliet why art thou yet so fair shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous and that the lean abhorr\u00e8d monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour for fear of that i still will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night depart again here here will i remain with worms that are thy chambermaids o here will i set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world wearied flesh eyes look your last arms take your last embrace and lips o you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death come bitter conduct come unsavory guide thou desperate pilot now at once run on the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark here's to my love o true apothecary thy drugs are quick thus with a kiss i die", "Ham_Claudius": "though yet of hamlet our dear brother's death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th' imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as 'twere with a defeated joy with an auspicious and a dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barred your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother's death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagu\u00e8d with this dream of his advantage he hath not failed to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears of this his nephew's purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell and now laertes what's the news with you you told us of some suit what is 't laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes have you your father's leave what says polonius take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will  but now my cousin hamlet and my son  how is it that the clouds still hang on you 'tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness 'tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschooled for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie 'tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son why 'tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again respeaking earthly thunder come away welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet's transformation so call it sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father's death that thus hath put him so much from th' understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and sith so neighbored to his youth and havior that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that opened lies within our remedy thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thou still hast been the father of good news o speak of that that do i long to hear thyself do grace to them and bring them in he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found the head and source of all your son's distemper well we shall sift him welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway it likes us well and at our more considered time we'll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labor go to your rest at night we'll feast together most welcome home but how hath she received his love as of a man faithful and honorable do you think 'tis this not that i know how may we try it further we will try it and can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose into these delights sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as 'twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behaved if 't be th' affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for o 'tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot's cheek beautied with plast'ring art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lacked form a little was not like madness there's something in his soul o'er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on 't it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatched go how fares our cousin hamlet i have nothing with this answer hamlet these words are not mine have you heard the argument is there no offense in 't what do you call the play give me some light away i like him not nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range therefore prepare you i your commission will forthwith dispatch and he to england shall along with you the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so near 's as doth hourly grow out of his brows arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage for we will fetters put about this fear which now goes too free footed thanks dear my lord o my offense is rank it smells to heaven it hath the primal eldest curse upon 't a brother's murder pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and like a man to double business bound i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect what if this curs\u00e8d hand were thicker than itself with brother's blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offense and what's in prayer but this twofold force to be forestall\u00e8d ere we come to fall or pardoned being down then i'll look up my fault is past but o what form of prayer can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder that cannot be since i am still possessed of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen may one be pardoned and retain th' offense in the corrupted currents of this world offense's gilded hand may shove by justice and oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law but 'tis not so above there is no shuffling there the action lies in his true nature and we ourselves compelled even to the teeth and forehead of our faults to give in evidence what then what rests try what repentance can what can it not yet what can it when one cannot repent o wretched state o bosom black as death o lim\u00e8d soul that struggling to be free art more engaged help angels make assay bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel be soft as sinews of the newborn babe all may be well my words fly up my thoughts remain below words without thoughts never to heaven go there's matter in these sighs these profound heaves you must translate 'tis fit we understand them where is your son what gertrude how does hamlet o heavy deed it had been so with us had we been there his liberty is full of threats to all  to you yourself to us to everyone alas how shall this bloody deed be answered it will be laid to us whose providence should have kept short restrained and out of haunt this mad young man but so much was our love we would not understand what was most fit but like the owner of a foul disease to keep it from divulging let it feed even on the pith of life where is he gone o gertrude come away the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch but we will ship him hence and this vile deed we must with all our majesty and skill both countenance and excuse ho guildenstern friends both go join you with some further aid hamlet in madness hath polonius slain and from his mother's closet hath he dragged him go seek him out speak fair and bring the body into the chapel i pray you haste in this come gertrude we'll call up our wisest friends and let them know both what we mean to do and what's untimely done whose whisper o'er the world's diameter as level as the cannon to his blank transports his poisoned shot may miss our name and hit the woundless air o come away my soul is full of discord and dismay i have sent to seek him and to find the body how dangerous is it that this man goes loose yet must not we put the strong law on him he's loved of the distracted multitude who like not in their judgment but their eyes and where 'tis so th' offender's scourge is weighed but never the offense to bear all smooth and even this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate pause diseases desperate grown by desperate appliance are relieved or not at all how now what hath befallen but where is he bring him before us now hamlet where's polonius at supper where alas alas what dost thou mean by this where is polonius go seek him there hamlet this deed for thine especial safety which we do tender as we dearly grieve for that which thou hast done must send thee hence with fiery quickness therefore prepare thyself the bark is ready and the wind at help th' associates tend and everything is bent for england ay hamlet so is it if thou knew'st our purposes thy loving father hamlet follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard delay it not i'll have him hence tonight away for everything is sealed and done that else leans on th' affair pray you make haste and england if my love thou hold'st at aught as my great power thereof may give thee sense since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red after the danish sword and thy free awe pays homage to us thou mayst not coldly set our sovereign process which imports at full by letters congruing to that effect the present death of hamlet do it england for like the hectic in my blood he rages and thou must cure me till i know 'tis done howe'er my haps my joys will ne'er begin how do you pretty lady conceit upon her father pretty ophelia  how long hath she been thus follow her close give her good watch i pray you o this is the poison of deep grief it springs all from her father's death and now behold o gertrude gertrude when sorrows come they come not single spies but in battalions first her father slain next your son gone and he most violent author of his own just remove the people muddied thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers for good polonius' death and we have done but greenly in hugger mugger to inter him poor ophelia divided from herself and her fair judgment without the which we are pictures or mere beasts last and as much containing as all these her brother is in secret come from france feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds and wants not buzzers to infect his ear with pestilent speeches of his father's death wherein necessity of matter beggared will nothing stick our person to arraign in ear and ear o my dear gertrude this like to a murd'ring piece in many places gives me superfluous death attend where is my switzers let them guard the door what is the matter the doors are broke what is the cause laertes that thy rebellion looks so giant like  let him go gertrude do not fear our person there's such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would acts little of his will tell me laertes why thou art thus incensed let him go gertrude  speak man dead let him demand his fill who shall stay you good laertes if you desire to know the certainty of your dear father is 't writ in your revenge that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe winner and loser will you know them then why now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman that i am guiltless of your father's death and am most sensibly in grief for it it shall as level to your judgment 'pear as day does to your eye laertes i must commune with your grief or you deny me right go but apart make choice of whom your wisest friends you will and they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me if by direct or by collateral hand they find us touched we will our kingdom give our crown our life and all that we call ours to you in satisfaction but if not be you content to lend your patience to us and we shall jointly labor with your soul to give it due content so you shall and where th' offense is let the great ax fall i pray you go with me now must your conscience my acquittance seal and you must put me in your heart for friend sith you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed but yet to me they're strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which she is so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection work like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timbered for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again but not where i have aimed them break not your sleeps for that you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more i loved your father and we love ourself and that i hope will teach you to imagine  how now what news from hamlet who brought them laertes you shall hear them  leave us high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom tomorrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return hamlet what should this mean are all the rest come back or is it some abuse and no such thing 'tis hamlet's character naked  and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise me if it be so laertes as how should it be so how otherwise will you be ruled by me to thine own peace if he be now returned as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to an exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practice and call it accident it falls right you have been talked of since your travel much and that in hamlet's hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege a very ribbon in the cap of youth  yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy i have seen myself and served against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft in 't he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as had he been encorpsed and demi natured with the brave beast so far he topped my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did a norman the very same he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defense and for your rapier most especial that he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the 'scrimers of their nation he swore had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposed them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming o'er to play with you now out of this  laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a pleurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick of th' ulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself indeed your father's son more than in words no place indeed should murder sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber hamlet returned shall know you are come home we'll put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practice requite him for your father let's further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance 'twere better not assayed therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this did blast in proof soft let me see we'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings  i ha 't when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink i'll have prepared him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping if he by chance escape your venomed stuck our purpose may hold there but stay what noise let's follow gertrude how much i had to do to calm his rage now fear i this will give it start again therefore let's follow pluck them asunder o he is mad laertes i pray thee good horatio wait upon him strengthen your patience in our last night's speech we'll put the matter to the present push  good gertrude set some watch over your son  this grave shall have a living monument an hour of quiet thereby shall we see till then in patience our proceeding be come hamlet come and take this hand from me give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet you know the wager i do not fear it i have seen you both but since he is better we have therefore odds set me the stoups of wine upon that table  if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmark's crown have worn give me the cups and let the kettle to the trumpet speak the trumpet to the cannoneer without the cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth now the king drinks to hamlet come begin and you the judges bear a wary eye stay give me drink hamlet this pearl is thine here's to thy health give him the cup our son shall win gertrude do not drink it is the poisoned cup it is too late i do not think 't part them they are incensed she swoons to see them bleed o yet defend me friends i am but hurt", "AYL_Rosalind": "dear celia i show more mirth than i am mistress of and would you yet i were merrier unless you could teach me to forget a banished father

know that i am in this forest and in man's apparel looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled it may well be called jove's tree when it drops forth such fruit proceed though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground o ominous he comes to kill my heart do you not know i am a woman when i think i must speak sweet say on 'tis he slink by and note him i will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him do you hear forester i pray you what is 't o'clock then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock by no means sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons i'll tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a se'nnight time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal there were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that fancy monger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him there is none of my uncle's marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation but you are no such man you are rather point device in your accouterments as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other me believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his love his mistress and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this color would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart that there shall not be one spot of love in 't i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me go with me to it and i'll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live will you go nay you must call me rosalind come sister will you go never talk to me i will weep but have i not cause to weep his very hair is of the dissembling color i' faith his hair is of a good color and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not do you think so not true in love you have heard him swear downright he was i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him he asked me of what parentage i was i told him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando o come let us remove the sight of lovers feedeth those in love bring us to this sight and you shall say i'll prove a busy actor in their play and why i pray you who might be your mother that you insult exult and all at once over the wretched what though you have no beauty  as by my faith i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed  must you be therefore proud and pitiless why what means this why do you look on me i see no more in you than in the ordinary of nature's sale work 'od's my little life i think she means to tangle my eyes too  no faith proud mistress hope not after it 'tis not your inky brows your black silk hair your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream that can entame my spirits to your worship  you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her like foggy south puffing with wind and rain you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman 'tis such fools as you that makes the world full of ill favored children 'tis not her glass but you that flatters her and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her  but mistress know yourself down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good man's love for i must tell you friendly in your ear sell when you can you are not for all markets cry the man mercy love him take his offer foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer  so take her to thee shepherd fare you well he's fall'n in love with your foulness and she'll fall in love with my anger if it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks i'll sauce her with bitter words why look you so upon me i pray you do not fall in love with me for i am falser than vows made in wine besides i like you not if you will know my house 'tis at the tuft of olives here hard by  will you go sister shepherd ply her hard  come sister shepherdess look on him better and be not proud though all the world could see none could be so abused in sight as he  come to our flock they say you are a melancholy fellow those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards why then 'tis good to be a post a traveller by my faith you have great reason to be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide god for making you that countenance you are or i will scarce think you have swam in a gondola why how now orlando where have you been all this while you a lover an you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more break an hour's promise in love he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid hath clapped him o' th' shoulder but i'll warrant him heart whole nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight i had as lief be wooed of a snail ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head a better jointure i think than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with him why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife and i am your rosalind come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday humor and like enough to consent what would you say to me now an i were your very very rosalind nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking god warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter marry that should you if i were your mistress or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit am not i your rosalind well in her person i say i will not have you no faith die by attorney the poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a love cause troilus had his brains dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love leander he would have lived many a fair year though hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was hero of sestos but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now i will be your rosalind in a more coming on disposition and ask me what you will i will grant it yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all ay and twenty such are you not good why then can one desire too much of a good thing come sister you shall be the priest and marry us give me your hand orlando what do you say sister you must begin will you orlando  ay but when then you must say i take thee rosalind for wife i might ask you for your commission but i do take thee orlando for my husband there's a girl goes before the priest and certainly a woman's thought runs before her actions now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her say a day without the ever no no orlando men are april when they woo december when they wed maids are may when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock pigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyena and that when thou art inclined to sleep by my life she will do as i do or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a woman's wit and it will out at the casement shut that and 'twill out at the keyhole stop that 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbor's bed marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue o that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and i thought no less that flattering tongue of yours won me 'tis but one cast away and so come death two o'clock is your hour by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour i will think you the most pathetical break promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep your promise well time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try adieu o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love but it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of portugal no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone's eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep i am in love i'll tell thee aliena i cannot be out of the sight of orlando i'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come how say you now is it not past two o'clock and here much orlando patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer bear this bear all she says i am not fair that i lack manners she calls me proud and that she could not love me were man as rare as phoenix 'od's my will her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me well shepherd well this is a letter of your own device come come you are a fool and turned into the extremity of love i saw her hand she has a leathern hand a freestone colored hand i verily did think that her old gloves were on but 'twas her hands she has a huswife's hand but that's no matter i say she never did invent this letter this is a man's invention and his hand why 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style a style for challengers why she defies me like turk to christian women's gentle brain could not drop forth such giant rude invention such ethiop words blacker in their effect than in their countenance will you hear the letter she phoebes me mark how the tyrant writes art thou god to shepherd turned that a maiden's heart hath burned can a woman rail thus why thy godhead laid apart warr'st thou with a woman's heart did you ever hear such railing whiles the eye of man did woo me that could do no vengeance to me meaning me a beast if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine alack in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect whiles you chid me i did love how then might your prayers move he that brings this love to thee little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make or else by him my love deny and then i'll study how to die do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt thou love such a woman what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee not to be endured well go your way to her for i see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her that if she love me i charge her to love thee if she will not i will never have her unless thou entreat for her if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company i am what must we understand by this but to orlando did he leave him there food to the sucked and hungry lioness was 't you he rescued but for the bloody napkin i would i were at home i do so i confess it ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited i pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited heigh ho counterfeit i assure you so i do but i' faith i should have been a woman by right i shall devise something but i pray you commend my counterfeiting to him will you go god save you brother o my dear orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkercher o i know where you are nay 'tis true there was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesar's thrasonical brag of i came saw and overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked no sooner looked but they loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage they are in the very wrath of love and they will together clubs cannot part them why then tomorrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind i will weary you then no longer with idle talking know of me then for now i speak to some purpose that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch i say i know you are neither do i labor for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me believe then if you please that i can do strange things i have since i was three year old conversed with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her i know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger by my life i do which i tender dearly though i say i am a magician therefore put you in your best array bid your friends for if you will be married tomorrow you shall and to rosalind if you will look here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers i care not if i have it is my study to seem despiteful and ungentle to you you are there followed by a faithful shepherd look upon him love him he worships you and i for no woman and i for no woman and so am i for no woman why do you speak too why blame you me to love you pray you no more of this 'tis like the howling of irish wolves against the moon i will help you if i can i would love you if i could tomorrow meet me all together i will marry you if ever i marry woman and i'll be married tomorrow i will satisfy you if ever i satisfy man and you shall be married tomorrow i will content you if what pleases you contents you and you shall be married tomorrow as you love rosalind meet as you love phoebe meet and as i love no woman i'll meet so fare you well i have left you commands patience once more whiles our compact is urged you say if i bring in your rosalind you will bestow her on orlando here and you say you will have her when i bring her you say you'll marry me if i be willing but if you do refuse to marry me you'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd you say that you'll have phoebe if she will i have promised to make all this matter even keep you your word o duke to give your daughter  you yours orlando to receive his daughter  keep you your word phoebe that you'll marry me or else refusing me to wed this shepherd  keep your word silvius that you'll marry her if she refuse me and from hence i go to make these doubts all even to you i give myself for i am yours to you i give myself for i am yours i'll have no father if you be not he i'll have no husband if you be not he nor ne'er wed woman if you be not she it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue if it be true that good wine needs no bush 'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues what a case am i in then that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play i am not furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me my way is to conjure you and i'll begin with the women i charge you o women for the love you bear to men to like as much of this play as please you and i charge you o men for the love you bear to women as i perceive by your simpering none of you hates them that between you and the women the play may please if i were a woman i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me complexions that liked me and breaths that i defied not and i am sure as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when i make curtsy bid me farewell", "TGV_Valentine": "cease to persuade my loving proteus home keeping youth have ever homely wits were 't not affection chains thy tender days to the sweet glances of thy honored love i rather would entreat thy company to see the wonders of the world abroad than living dully sluggardized at home wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness but since thou lov'st love still and thrive therein even as i would when i to love begin and on a love book pray for my success that's on some shallow story of deep love how young leander crossed the hellespont 'tis true for you are over boots in love and yet you never swam the hellespont no i will not for it boots thee not to be in love where scorn is bought with groans coy looks with heart sore sighs one fading moment's mirth with twenty watchful weary tedious nights if haply won perhaps a hapless gain if lost why then a grievous labor won how ever but a folly bought with wit or else a wit by folly vanquish\u00e8d so by your circumstance i fear you'll prove love is your master for he masters you and he that is so yok\u00e8d by a fool methinks should not be chronicled for wise and writers say as the most forward bud is eaten by the canker ere it blow even so by love the young and tender

lord a son that well deserves the honor and regard of such a father i knew him as myself for from our infancy we have conversed and spent our hours together and though myself have been an idle truant omitting the sweet benefit of time to clothe mine age with angel like perfection yet hath sir proteus for that's his name  made use and fair advantage of his days his years but young but his experience old his head unmellowed but his judgment ripe and in a word for far behind his worth comes all the praises that i now bestow  he is complete in feature and in mind with all good grace to grace a gentleman should i have wished a thing it had been he this is the gentleman i told your ladyship had come along with me but that his mistress did hold his eyes locked in her crystal looks nay

enthrall\u00e8d eyes and made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow o gentle proteus love's a mighty lord and hath so humbled me as i confess there is no woe to his correction nor to his service no such joy on earth now no discourse except it be of love now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep upon the very naked name of love even she and is she not a heavenly saint call her divine o flatter me for love delights in praises then speak the truth by her if not divine yet let her be a principality sovereign to all the creatures on the earth sweet except not any except thou wilt except against my love and i will help thee to prefer her too she shall be dignified with this high honor  to bear my lady's train lest the base earth should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss and of so great a favor growing proud disdain to root the summer swelling flower and make rough winter everlastingly pardon me proteus all i can is nothing to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing she is alone  not for the world why man she is mine own and i as rich in having such a jewel as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl the water nectar and the rocks pure gold forgive me that i do not dream on thee because thou seest me dote upon my love my foolish rival that her father likes only for his possessions are so huge is gone with her along and i must after for love thou know'st is full of jealousy ay and we are betrothed nay more our marriage hour with all the cunning manner of our flight determined of how i must climb her window the ladder made of cords and all the means plotted and 'greed on for my happiness good proteus go with me to my chamber in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel will you make haste please it your grace there is a messenger that stays to bear my letters to my friends and i am going to deliver them the tenor of them doth but signify my health and happy being at your court i know it well my lord and sure the match were rich and honorable besides the gentleman is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter cannot your grace win her to fancy him what would your grace have me to do in this win her with gifts if she respect not words dumb jewels often in their silent kind more than quick words do move a woman's mind a woman sometime scorns what best contents her send her another never give her o'er for scorn at first makes after love the more if she do frown 'tis not in hate of you but rather to beget more love in you if she do chide 'tis not to have you gone forwhy the fools are mad if left alone take no repulse whatever she doth say for get you gone she doth not mean away flatter and praise commend extol their graces though ne'er so black say they have angels' faces that man that hath a tongue i say is no man if with his tongue he cannot win a woman why then i would resort to her by night what lets but one may enter at her window why then a ladder quaintly made of cords to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks would serve to scale another hero's tower so bold leander would adventure it when would you use it pray sir tell me that by seven o'clock i'll get you such a ladder it will be light my lord that you may bear it under a cloak that is of any length ay my good lord why any cloak will serve the turn my lord and why not death rather than living torment to die is to be banished from myself and sylvia is myself banished from her is self from self a deadly banishment what light is light if sylvia be not seen what joy is joy if sylvia be not by  unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection except i be by sylvia in the night there is no music in the nightingale unless i look on sylvia in the day there is no day for me to look upon she is my essence and i leave to be if i be not by her fair influence fostered illumined cherished kept alive i fly not death to fly his deadly doom tarry i here i but attend on death but fly i hence i fly away from life no neither nothing my ears are stopped and cannot hear good news so much of bad already hath possessed them is sylvia dead no valentine indeed for sacred sylvia hath she forsworn me no valentine if sylvia have forsworn me what is your news o i have fed upon this woe already and now excess of it will make me surfeit doth sylvia know that i am banish\u00e8d no more unless the next word that thou speak'st have some malignant power upon my life if so i pray thee breathe it in mine ear as ending anthem of my endless dolor i pray thee lance an if thou seest my boy bid him make haste and meet me at the north gate o my dear sylvia hapless valentine my friends  then know that i have little wealth to lose a man i am crossed with adversity my riches are these poor habiliments of which if you should here disfurnish me you take the sum and substance that i have to verona from milan some sixteen months and longer might have stayed if crooked fortune had not thwarted me i was for that which now torments me to rehearse i killed a man whose death i much repent but yet i slew him manfully in fight without false vantage or base treachery i was and held me glad of such a doom my youthful travel therein made me happy or else i often had been miserable peace villain nothing but my fortune i take your offer and will live with you provided that you do no outrages on silly women or poor passengers how use doth breed a habit in a man this shadowy desert unfrequented woods i better brook than flourishing peopled towns here can i sit alone unseen of any and to the nightingale's complaining notes tune my distresses and record my woes o thou that dost inhabit in my breast leave not the mansion so long tenantless lest growing ruinous the building fall and leave no memory of what it was repair me with thy presence sylvia thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain what hallowing and what stir is this today these are my mates that make their wills their law have some unhappy passenger in chase they love me well yet i have much to do to keep them from uncivil outrages withdraw thee valentine who's this comes here how like a dream is this i see and hear love lend me patience to forbear awhile ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch thou friend of an ill fashion thou common friend that's without faith or love for such is a friend now treacherous man thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye could have persuaded me now i dare not say i have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me who should be trusted when one's right hand is perjured to the bosom proteus i am sorry i must never trust thee more but count the world a stranger for thy sake the private wound is deepest o time most accursed 'mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst then i am paid and once again i do receive thee honest who by repentance is not satisfied is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased by penitence th' eternal's wrath's appeased and that my love may appear plain and free all that was mine in sylvia i give thee why boy why wag how now what's the matter look up speak come come a hand from either let me be blest to make this happy close 'twere pity two such friends should be long foes forbear forbear i say it is my lord the duke your grace is welcome to a man disgraced banished valentine thurio give back or else embrace thy death come not within the measure of my wrath do not name sylvia thine if once again verona shall not hold thee here she stands take but possession of her with a touch  i dare thee but to breathe upon my love i thank your grace the gift hath made me happy i now beseech you for your daughter's sake to grant one boon that i shall ask of you these banished men that i have kept withal are men endued with worthy qualities forgive them what they have committed here and let them be recalled from their exile they are reform\u00e8d civil full of good and fit for great employment worthy lord and as we walk along i dare be

besieged with sable colored melancholy i did commend the black oppressing humor to the most wholesome physic of thy health giving air and as i am a gentleman betook myself to walk the time when about the sixth hour when beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper so much for the time when now for the ground which which i mean i walked upon it is

of aquitaine is bound to us although not valued to the money's worth if then the king your father will restore but that one half which is unsatisfied we will give up our right in aquitaine and hold fair friendship with his majesty but that it seems he little purposeth for here he doth demand to have repaid a hundred thousand crowns and not demands on payment of a hundred thousand crowns to have his title live in aquitaine  which we much rather had depart withal and have the money by our father lent than aquitaine so gelded as it is dear princess were not his requests so far from reason's

her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her upon this hint i spake she loved me for the dangers i had passed and i loved her that she did pity them this only is the

heart that passion cannot rule i think so too certain men should be what they seem nay yet there's more in this i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words thou dost conspire against thy friend iago if thou but think'st him wronged and mak'st his ear a stranger to thy thoughts what dost thou mean by heaven i'll know thy thoughts ha o misery why why is this think'st thou i'd make a life of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises matching thy inference 'tis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are more virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me no iago i'll see before i doubt when i doubt prove and on the proof there is no more but this away at once with love or jealousy dost thou say so and so she did i am bound to thee forever not a jot not a jot i will not no not much moved i do not think but desdemona's honest and yet how nature erring from itself  farewell farewell if more thou dost perceive let me know more set on thy wife to observe leave me iago why did i marry this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more much more than he unfolds fear not my government this fellow's of exceeding honesty and knows all qualities with a learn\u00e8d spirit of human dealings if i do prove her haggard though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings i'd whistle her off and let her down the wind to prey at fortune haply for i am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have or for i am declined into the vale of years yet that's not much  she's gone i am abused and my relief must be to loathe her o curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapor of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others' uses yet 'tis the plague of great ones prerogatived are they less than the base 'tis destiny unshunnable like death even then this fork\u00e8d plague is fated to us when we do quicken look where she comes if she be false heaven mocks itself i'll not believe 't i am to blame i have a pain upon my forehead here your napkin is too little let it alone come i'll go in with you ha ha false to me avaunt begone thou hast set me on the rack i swear 'tis better to be much abused than but to know 't a little what sense had i of her stol'n hours of lust i saw 't not thought it not it harmed not me i slept the next night well fed well was free and merry i found not cassio's kisses on her lips he that is robbed not wanting what is stol'n let him not know 't and he's not robbed at all i had been happy if the general camp pioners and all had tasted her sweet body so i had nothing known o now forever farewell the tranquil mind farewell content farewell the plum\u00e8d troops and the big wars that makes ambition virtue o farewell farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spirit stirring drum th' ear piercing fife the royal banner and all quality pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war and o you mortal engines whose rude throats th' immortal jove's dread clamors counterfeit farewell othello's occupation's gone villain be sure thou prove my love a whore be sure of it give me the ocular proof or by the worth of mine eternal soul thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my waked wrath make me to see 't or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life if thou dost slander her and torture me never pray more abandon all remorse on horror's head horrors accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that nay stay thou shouldst be honest by the world i think my wife be honest and think she is not i think that thou art just and think thou art not i'll have some proof her name that was as fresh as dian's visage is now begrimed and black as mine own face if there be cords or knives poison or fire or suffocating streams i'll not endure it would i were satisfied would nay and i will death and damnation o give me a living reason she's disloyal o monstrous monstrous but this denoted a foregone conclusion 'tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream i'll tear her all to pieces i gave her such a one 'twas my first gift if it be that  o that the slave had forty thousand lives one is too poor too weak for my revenge now do i see 'tis true look here iago all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven 'tis gone arise black vengeance from the hollow hell yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught for 'tis of aspics' tongues o blood blood blood never iago like to the pontic sea whose icy current and compulsive course ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on to the propontic and the hellespont even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them up now by yond marble heaven in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words i greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous and will upon the instant put thee to 't within these three days let me hear thee say that cassio's not alive damn her lewd minx o damn her damn her come go with me apart i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil now art thou my lieutenant well

sense aches at thee would thou hadst ne'er been born was this fair paper this most goodly book made to write whore upon what committed committed o thou public commoner i should make very forges of my cheeks that would to cinders burn up modesty did i but speak thy deeds what committed heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets is hushed within the hollow mine of earth and will not hear 't what committed impudent strumpet are not you a strumpet what not a whore is 't possible i cry you mercy then i took you for that cunning whore of venice that married with othello you mistress that have the office opposite to saint peter and keeps the gate of hell you you ay you we have done our course there's money for your pains i pray you turn the key and keep

strumpet i come forth of my heart those charms thine eyes are blotted thy bed lust stained shall with lust's blood be spotted it is the cause it is the cause my soul let me not name it to you you chaste stars it is the cause yet i'll not shed her blood nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow and smooth as monumental alabaster yet she must die else she'll betray more men put out the light and then put out the light if i quench thee thou flaming minister i can again thy former light restore should i repent me but once put out thy light thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature i know not where is that promethean heat that can thy light relume when i have plucked the rose i cannot give it vital growth again it needs must wither i'll smell it on the tree o balmy breath that dost almost persuade justice to break her sword one more one more be thus when thou art dead and i will kill thee and love thee after one more and this the last so sweet was ne'er so fatal i must weep but they are cruel tears this sorrow's heavenly it strikes where it doth love she wakes ay desdemona have you prayed tonight desdemon if you bethink yourself of any crime unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace solicit for it straight well do it and be brief i will walk by i would not kill thy unprepar\u00e8d spirit no heaven forfend i would not kill thy soul ay i do amen with all my heart humh think on thy sins ay and for that thou diest peace and be still that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee thou gav'st to cassio sweet soul take heed take heed of perjury thou art on thy deathbed yes presently therefore confess thee freely of thy sin for to deny each article with oath cannot remove nor choke the strong conception that i do groan withal thou art to die i say amen by heaven i saw my handkerchief in 's hand o perjured woman thou dost stone my heart and mak'st me call what i intend to do a murder which i thought a sacrifice i saw the handkerchief he hath confessed that he hath used thee ay no his mouth is stopped honest iago hath ta'en order for 't had all his hairs been lives my great revenge had stomach for them all out strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face down strumpet nay if you strive  being done there is no pause it is too late what noise is this not dead not yet quite dead i that am cruel am yet merciful i would not have thee linger in thy pain so so who's there yes 'tis emilia by and by she's dead 'tis like she comes to speak of cassio's death the noise was here ha no more moving still as the grave shall she come in were 't good i think she stirs again no what's best to do if she come in she'll sure speak to my wife my wife my wife what wife i have no wife o insupportable o heavy hour methinks it should be now a huge eclipse of sun and moon and that th' affrighted globe should yawn at alteration i had forgot thee o come in emilia  soft by and by let me the curtains draw  where art thou what's the matter with thee now what now it is the very error of the moon she comes more nearer earth than she was wont and makes men mad roderigo killed and cassio killed not cassio killed then murder's out of tune and sweet revenge grows harsh that what why how should she be murdered you heard her say herself it was not i she's like a liar gone to burning hell 'twas i that killed her she turned to folly and she was a whore she was false as water cassio did top her ask thy husband else o i were damned beneath all depth in hell but that i did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity thy husband knew it all thy husband ay with cassio had she been true if heaven would make me such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite i'd not have sold her for it ay 'twas he that told me on her first an honest man he is and hates the slime that sticks on filthy deeds what needs this iterance woman i say thy husband he woman i say thy husband dost understand the word my friend thy husband honest honest iago hah peace you were best nay stare not masters it is true indeed o o o o she was foul  i scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopped i know this act shows horrible and grim 'tis pitiful but yet iago knows that she with cassio hath the act of shame a thousand times committed cassio confessed it and she did gratify his amorous works with that recognizance and pledge of love which i first gave her i saw it in his hand it was a handkerchief an antique token my father gave my mother are there no stones in heaven but what serves for the thunder precious villain i am not valiant neither but every puny whipster gets my sword but why should honor outlive honesty let it go all i have another weapon in this chamber it is a sword of spain the ice brook's temper o here it is uncle i must come forth look in upon me then and speak with me or naked as i am i will assault thee behold i have a weapon a better never did itself sustain upon a soldier's thigh i have seen the day that with this little arm and this good sword i have made my way through more impediments than twenty times your stop but o vain boast  who can control his fate 'tis not so now be not afraid though you do see me weaponed here is my journey's end here is my butt and very sea mark of my utmost sail do you go back dismayed 'tis a lost fear man but a rush against othello's breast and he retires where should othello go now how dost thou look now o ill starred wench pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven and fiends will snatch at it cold cold my girl even like thy chastity o curs\u00e8d curs\u00e8d slave  whip me you devils from the possession of this heavenly sight blow me about in winds roast me in sulfur wash me in steep down gulfs of liquid fire o desdemon dead desdemon dead o o that's he that was othello here i am i look down towards his feet but that's a fable  if that thou be'st a devil i cannot kill thee i am not sorry neither i'd have thee live for in my sense 'tis happiness to die why anything an honorable murderer if you will for naught i did in hate but all in honor ay i do believe it and i ask your pardon will you i pray demand that demi devil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body well thou dost best o villain o thou pernicious caitiff  how came you cassio by that handkerchief that was my wife's o fool fool fool soft you a word or two before you go i have done the state some service and they know 't no more of that i pray you in your letters when you shall these unlucky deeds relate speak of me as i am nothing extenuate nor set down aught in malice then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well of one not easily jealous but being wrought perplexed in the extreme of one whose hand like the base judean threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes albeit unused to the melting mood drops tears as fast as the arabian trees their medicinable gum set you down this and say besides that in aleppo once where a malignant and a turbanned turk beat a venetian and traduced the state i took by th' throat the circumcis\u00e8d dog and smote him thus i

dog for a new year's gift 'sblood the rogues slighted me into the river with as little remorse as they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies fifteen i' th' litter and you may know by my size that i have a kind of alacrity in sinking if the bottom were as deep as hell i should down i had been drowned but that the shore was shelvy and shallow a death that i abhor for the water swells a man and what a thing should i have been when i had been swelled by the lord i should have been a mountain of mummy come let me pour in some sack to the thames water for my belly's as cold as if i had swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the reins call her in take away these chalices go brew me a pottle of sack finely simple of itself i'll no pullet sperm in my brewage how now mistress ford i have

money well o here he comes now master brook you come to know what hath passed between me and ford's wife master brook i will not lie to you i was at her house the hour she appointed me very ill favoredly master brook no master brook but the peaking cornuto her husband master brook dwelling in a continual 'larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of our encounter after we had embraced kissed protested and as it were spoke the prologue of our comedy and at his heels a rabble of his companions thither provoked and instigated by his distemper and forsooth to search his house for his wife's love while i was there you shall hear as good luck would have it comes in one mistress page gives intelligence of ford's approach and in her invention and ford's wife's distraction they conveyed me into a buck basket by the lord a buck basket rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy napkins that master brook there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril nay you shall hear master brook what i have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good being thus crammed in the basket a couple of ford's knaves his hinds were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to datchet lane they took me on their shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the door who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket i quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it but fate ordaining he should be a cuckold held his hand well on went he for a search and away went i for foul clothes but mark the sequel master brook i suffered the pangs of three several deaths first an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bellwether next to be compassed like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head and then to be stopped in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease think of that a man of my kidney think of that that am as subject to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution and thaw it was a miracle to 'scape suffocation and in the height of this bath when i was more than half stewed in grease like a dutch dish to be thrown into the thames and cooled glowing hot in that surge like a horseshoe think of that hissing hot think of that master brook master brook i will be thrown into etna as i have been into thames ere i will leave her thus her husband is this morning gone a birding i have received from her another embassy of meeting 'twixt eight and nine is the hour master brook is it i will then address me to my appointment come to me at your convenient leisure and you shall know how i speed and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her adieu you shall have her master brook master brook you shall cuckold ford mistress ford your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance i see you are obsequious in your love and i profess requital to a hair's breadth not only mistress ford in the simple office of love but in all the accoutrement compliment and ceremony of it but are you sure of your husband now no i'll come no more i' th' basket may i not go out ere he come what shall i do i'll creep up into the chimney where is it i'll go out then good hearts devise something any extremity rather than a mischief how now mine host there was mine host an old fat woman even now with me but she's gone ay marry was it mussel shell what would you with her i spake with the old woman about it marry she says that the very same man that beguiled master slender of his chain cozened him of

employed was pre employed by him he has discovered my design and i remain a pinched thing yea a very trick for them to play at will how came the posterns so easily open i know 't too well give me the boy i am glad you did not nurse him though he does bear some signs of me yet you have too much blood in him bear the boy hence he shall not come about her away with him and let her sport herself with that she's big with for 'tis polixenes has made thee swell thus you my lords look on her mark her well be but about to say she is a goodly lady and the justice of your hearts will thereto add 'tis pity she's not honest honorable praise her but for this her without door form which on my faith deserves high speech and straight the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands that calumny doth use o i am out that mercy does for calumny will sear virtue itself these shrugs these s and s when you have said she's goodly come between ere you can say she's honest but be 't known from him that has most cause to grieve it should be she's an adult'ress you have mistook my lady polixenes for leontes o thou thing which i'll not call a creature of thy place lest barbarism making me the precedent should a like language use to all degrees and mannerly distinguishment leave out betwixt the prince and beggar i have said she's an adult'ress i have said with whom more she's a traitor and camillo is a federary with her and one that knows what she should shame to know herself but with her most vile principal that she's a bed swerver even as bad as those that vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy to this their late escape no if i mistake in those foundations which i build upon the center is not big enough to bear a schoolboy's top away with her to prison he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty but that he speaks shall i be heard go do our bidding hence hold your peaces cease no more you smell this business with a sense as cold as is a dead man's nose but i do see 't and feel 't as you feel doing thus and see withal the instruments that feel what lack i credit why what need we commune with you of this but rather follow our forceful instigation our prerogative calls not your counsels but our natural goodness imparts this which if you or stupefied or seeming so in skill cannot or will not relish a truth like us inform yourselves we need no more of your advice the matter the loss the gain the ord'ring on 't is all properly ours how could that be either thou art most ignorant by age or thou wert born a fool camillo's flight added to their familiarity  which was as gross as ever touched conjecture that lacked sight only naught for approbation but only seeing all other circumstances made up to th' deed doth push on this proceeding yet for a greater confirmation  for in an act of this importance 'twere most piteous to be wild i have dispatched in post to sacred delphos to apollo's temple cleomenes and dion whom you know of stuffed sufficiency now from the oracle they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had shall stop or spur me have i done well though i am satisfied and need no more than what i know yet shall the oracle give rest to th' minds of others such as he whose ignorant credulity will not come up to th' truth so have we thought it good from our free person she should be confined lest that the treachery of the two fled hence be left her to perform come follow us we are to speak in public for this business will raise us all nor night nor day no rest it is but weakness to bear the matter thus mere weakness if the cause were not in being part o' th' cause she th' adult'ress for the harlot king is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank and level of my brain plot proof but she i can hook to me say that she were gone given to the fire a moiety of my rest might come to me again who's there how does the boy to see his nobleness conceiving the dishonor of his mother he straight declined drooped took it deeply fastened and fixed the shame on 't in himself threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep and downright languished leave me solely go see how he fares fie fie no thought of him the very thought of my revenges that way recoil upon me in himself too mighty and in his parties his alliance let him be until a time may serve for present vengeance take it on her camillo and polixenes laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow they should not laugh if i could reach them nor shall she within my power what noise there ho how  away with that audacious lady antigonus i charged thee that she should not come about me i knew she would what canst not rule her good queen force her hence out a mankind witch hence with her out o' door a most intelligencing bawd traitors will you not push her out give her the bastard thou dotard thou art woman tired unroosted by thy dame partlet here take up the bastard take 't up i say give 't to thy crone he dreads his wife a nest of traitors a callet of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband and now baits me this brat is none of mine it is the issue of polixenes hence with it and together with the dam commit them to the fire a gross hag  and losel thou art worthy to be hanged that wilt not stay her tongue once more take her hence i'll ha' thee burnt on your allegiance out of the chamber with her were i a tyrant where were her life she durst not call me so if she did know me one away with her thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this my child away with 't even thou that hast a heart so tender o'er it take it hence and see it instantly consumed with fire even thou and none but thou take it up straight within this hour bring me word 'tis done and by good testimony or i'll seize thy life with what thou else call'st thine if thou refuse and wilt encounter with my wrath say so the bastard brains with these my proper hands shall i dash out go take it to the fire for thou sett'st on thy wife you're liars all i am a feather for each wind that blows shall i live on to see this bastard kneel and call me father better burn it now than curse it then but be it let it live it shall not neither you sir come you hither you that have been so tenderly officious with lady margery your midwife there to save this bastard's life for 'tis a bastard so sure as this beard's gray what will you adventure to save this brat's life it shall be possible swear by this sword thou wilt perform my bidding mark and perform it seest thou for the fail of any point in 't shall not only be death to thyself but to thy lewd tongued wife whom for this time we pardon we enjoin thee as thou art liegeman to us that thou carry this female bastard hence and that thou bear it to some remote and desert place quite out of our dominions and that there thou leave it without more mercy to it own protection and favor of the climate as by strange fortune it came to us i do in justice charge thee on thy soul's peril and thy body's torture that thou commend it strangely to some place where chance may nurse or end it take it up no i'll not rear another's issue twenty three days they have been absent 'tis good speed foretells the great apollo suddenly will have the truth of this appear prepare you lords summon a session that we may arraign our most disloyal lady for as she hath been publicly accused so shall she have a just and open trial while she lives my heart will be a burden to me leave me and think upon my bidding this sessions to our great grief we pronounce even pushes 'gainst our heart the party tried the daughter of a king our wife and one of us too much beloved let us be cleared of being tyrannous since we so openly proceed in justice which shall have due course even to the guilt or the purgation produce the prisoner read the indictment i ne'er heard yet that any of these bolder vices wanted less impudence to gainsay what they did than to perform it first you will not own it you knew of his departure as you know what you have underta'en to do in 's absence your actions are my dreams you had a bastard by polixenes and i but dreamed it as you were past all shame  those of your fact are so so past all truth which to deny concerns more than avails for as thy brat hath been cast out like to itself no father owning it which is indeed more criminal in thee than it so thou shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage look for no less than death break up the seals and read hast thou read truth there is no truth at all i' th' oracle the sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood what is the business how gone apollo's angry and the heavens themselves do strike at my injustice how now there take her hence her heart is but o'ercharged she will recover i have too much believed mine own suspicion beseech you tenderly apply to her some remedies for life apollo pardon my great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle i'll reconcile me to polixenes new woo my queen recall the good camillo whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy for being transported by my jealousies to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose camillo for the minister to poison my friend polixenes which had been done but that the good mind of camillo tardied my swift command though i with death and with reward did threaten and encourage him not doing it and being done he most humane and filled with honor to my kingly guest unclasped my practice quit his fortunes here which you knew great and to the hazard of all incertainties himself commended no richer than his honor how he glisters through my rust and how his piety does my deeds make the blacker go on go on thou canst not speak too much i have deserved all tongues to talk their bitt'rest thou didst speak but well when most the truth which i receive much better than to be pitied of thee prithee bring me to the dead bodies of my queen and son one grave shall be for both upon them shall the causes of their death appear unto our shame perpetual once a day i'll visit the chapel where they lie and tears shed there shall be my recreation so long as nature will bear up with this exercise so long i daily vow to use it come and lead me to these sorrows whilst i remember her and her virtues i cannot forget my blemishes in them and so still think of the wrong i did myself which was so much that heirless it hath made my kingdom and destroyed the sweet'st companion that e'er man bred his hopes out of i think so killed she i killed i did so but thou strik'st me sorely to say i did it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now say so but seldom good paulina who hast the memory of hermione i know in honor o that ever i had squared me to thy counsel then even now i might have looked upon my queen's full eyes have taken treasure from her lips  thou speak'st truth no more such wives therefore no wife one worse and better used would make her sainted spirit again possess her corpse and on this stage where we offenders now appear soul vexed and begin why to me she had and would incense me to murder her i married stars stars and all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wife i'll have no wife paulina never paulina so be blest my spirit my true paulina we shall not marry

train his princess say you with him go cleomenes yourself assisted with your honored friends bring them to our embracement still 'tis strange he thus should steal upon us prithee no more cease thou know'st he dies to me again when talked of sure when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches will bring me to consider that which may unfurnish me of reason they are come your mother was most true to wedlock prince for she did print your royal father off conceiving you were i but twenty one your father's image is so hit in you his very air that i should call you brother as i did him and speak of something wildly by us performed before most dearly welcome and your fair princess goddess o alas i lost a couple that 'twixt heaven and earth might thus have stood begetting wonder as you gracious couple do and then i lost  all mine own folly the society amity too of your brave father whom though bearing misery i desire my life once more to look on him o my brother good gentleman the wrongs i have done thee stir afresh within me and these thy offices so rarely kind are as interpreters of my behindhand slackness welcome hither as is the spring to th' earth and hath he too exposed this paragon to th' fearful usage at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune to greet a man not worth her pains much less th' adventure of her person where the warlike smalus that noble honored lord is feared and loved the bless\u00e8d gods purge all infection from our air whilst you do climate here you have a holy father a graceful gentleman against whose person so sacred as it is i have done sin for which the heavens taking angry note have left me issueless and your father's blest as he from heaven merits it with you worthy his goodness what might i have been might i a son and daughter now have looked on such goodly things as you where's bohemia speak who camillo you are married my lord is this the daughter of a king that once i see by your good father's speed will come on very slowly i am sorry most sorry you have broken from his liking where you were tied in duty and as sorry your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty that you might well enjoy her would he do so i'd beg your precious mistress which he counts but a trifle i thought of her even in these looks i made but your petition is yet unanswered i will to your father your honor not o'erthrown by your desires i am friend to them and you upon which errand i now go toward him therefore follow me and mark what way i make come good my lord o grave and good paulina the great comfort that i have had of thee o paulina we honor you with trouble but we came to see the statue of our queen your gallery have we passed through not without much content in many singularities but we saw not that which my daughter came to look upon the statue of her mother her natural posture  chide me dear stone that i may say indeed thou art hermione or rather thou art she in thy not chiding for she was as tender as infancy and grace but yet paulina hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing so ag\u00e8d as this seems as now she might have done so much to my good comfort as it is now piercing to my soul o thus she stood even with such life of majesty warm life as now it coldly stands when first i wooed her i am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me for being more stone than it o royal piece there's magic in thy majesty which has my evils conjured to remembrance and from thy admiring daughter took the spirits standing like stone with thee do not draw the curtain let be let be would i were dead but that methinks already  what was he that did make it see my lord would you not deem it breathed and that those veins did verily bear blood the fixture of her eye has motion in 't as we are mocked with art o sweet paulina make me to think so twenty years together no settled senses of the world can match the pleasure of that madness let 't alone do paulina for this affliction has a taste as sweet as any cordial comfort still methinks there is an air comes from her what fine chisel could ever yet cut breath let no man mock me for i will kiss her no not these twenty years what you can make her do i am content to look on what to speak i am content to hear for 'tis as easy to make her speak as move proceed no foot shall stir o she's warm if this be magic let it be an art lawful as eating o peace paulina thou shouldst a husband take by my consent as i by thine a wife this is a match and made between 's by vows thou hast found mine  but how is to be questioned for i saw her as i thought dead and have in vain said many a prayer upon her grave i'll not seek far  for him i partly know his mind to find thee an honorable husband come camillo and take her by the hand whose worth and honesty is richly noted and here justified by us a pair of kings let's from this place what look upon my brother both your pardons that e'er i put between your holy looks my ill suspicion this your son in law and son unto the king whom heavens directing is troth plight to your daughter good paulina lead us from hence where we may leisurely each one demand and answer to his part performed in this wide gap of time since first we were dissevered hastily lead away", "Rom_Tybalt": "what art thou drawn among these heartless hinds turn thee benvolio look upon thy death what drawn and talk of peace i hate the word as i

o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure fare thee well  i know not gentlemen what you intend who else must be let blood who else is rank if i myself there is no hour so fit as caesar's death's hour nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords made rich with the most noble blood of all this world i do beseech you if you bear me hard now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke fulfill your pleasure live a thousand years i shall not find myself so apt to die no place will please me so no mean of death as here by caesar and by you cut off the choice and master spirits of this age i doubt not of your wisdom let each man render me his bloody hand first marcus brutus will i shake with you  next caius cassius do i take your hand  now decius brutus yours now yours metellus  yours cinna and my valiant casca yours  though last not least in love yours good trebonius  gentlemen all alas what shall i say my credit now stands on such slippery ground that one of two bad ways you must conceit me either a coward or a flatterer  that i did love thee caesar o 'tis true if then thy spirit look upon us now shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death to see thy antony making his peace shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes  most noble in the presence of thy corpse had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies pardon me julius here wast thou bayed brave hart here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy lethe o world thou wast the forest to this hart and this indeed o world the heart of thee how like a deer strucken by many princes dost thou here lie pardon me caius cassius the enemies of caesar shall say this then in a friend it is cold modesty therefore i took your hands but was indeed swayed from the point by looking down on caesar friends am i with you all and love you all upon this hope that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous that's all i seek and am moreover suitor that i may produce his body to the marketplace and in the pulpit as becomes a friend speak in the order of his funeral be it so i do desire no more o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth that i am meek and gentle with these butchers thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever liv\u00e8d in the tide of times woe to the hand that shed this costly blood over thy wounds now do i prophesy which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue a curse shall light upon the limbs of men domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quartered with the hands of war all pity choked with custom of fell deeds and caesar's spirit ranging for revenge with ate by his side come hot from hell shall in these confines with a monarch's voice cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men groaning for burial you serve octavius caesar do you not caesar did write for him to come to rome thy heart is big get thee apart and weep passion i see is catching for mine eyes seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine began to water is thy master coming post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome no rome of safety for octavius yet hie hence and tell him so yet stay awhile thou shalt not back till i have borne this corpse into the marketplace there shall i try in my oration how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men according to the which thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things lend me your hand for brutus' sake i am beholding to you you gentle romans  friends romans countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury caesar not to praise him the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interr\u00e8d with their bones so let it be with caesar the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answered it here under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honorable man so are they all all honorable men come i to speak in caesar's funeral he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honorable man he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honorable man you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse was this ambition yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honorable man i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do know you all did love him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourn for him  o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason bear with me my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pause till it come back to me but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world now lies he there and none so poor to do him reverence o masters if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honorable men i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you than i will wrong such honorable men but here's a parchment with the seal of caesar i found it in his closet 'tis his will let but the commons hear this testament which pardon me i do not mean to read and they would go and kiss dead caesar's wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood  yea beg a hair of him for memory and dying mention it within their wills bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue have patience gentle friends i must not read it it is not meet you know how caesar loved you you are not wood you are not stones but men and being men hearing the will of caesar it will inflame you it will make you mad 'tis good you know not that you are his heirs for if you should o what would come of it will you be patient will you stay awhile i have o'ershot myself to tell you of it i fear i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed caesar i do fear it you will compel me then to read the will then make a ring about the corpse of caesar and let me show you him that made the will shall i descend and will you give me leave nay press not so upon me stand far off if you have tears prepare to shed them now you all do know this mantle i remember the first time ever caesar put it on 'twas on a summer's evening in his tent that day he overcame the nervii look in this place ran cassius' dagger through see what a rent the envious casca made through this the well belov\u00e8d brutus stabbed and as he plucked his curs\u00e8d steel away mark how the blood of caesar followed it as rushing out of doors to be resolved if brutus so unkindly knocked or no for brutus as you know was caesar's angel judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors' arms quite vanquished him then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling up his face even at the base of pompey's statue which all the while ran blood great caesar fell o what a fall was there my countrymen then i and you and all of us fell down whilst bloody treason flourished over us o now you weep and i perceive you feel the dint of pity these are gracious drops kind souls what weep you when you but behold our caesar's vesture wounded look you here here is himself marred as you see with traitors stay countrymen good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny they that have done this deed are honorable what private griefs they have alas i know not that made them do it they are wise and honorable and will no doubt with reasons answer you i come not friends to steal away your hearts i am no orator as brutus is but as you know me all a plain blunt man that love my friend and that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of him for i have neither wit nor words nor worth action nor utterance nor the power of speech to stir men's blood i only speak right on i tell you that which you yourselves do know show you sweet caesar's wounds poor poor dumb mouths and bid them speak for me but were i brutus and brutus antony there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of caesar that should move the stones of rome to rise and mutiny yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak why friends you go to do you know not what wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves alas you know not i must tell you then you have forgot the will i told you of here is the will and under caesar's seal to every roman citizen he gives to every several man seventy five drachmas hear me with patience moreover he hath left you all his walks his private arbors and new planted orchards on this side tiber he hath left them you and to your heirs forever common pleasures to walk abroad and recreate yourselves here was a caesar when comes such another now let it work mischief thou art afoot take thou what course thou wilt how now fellow where is he and thither will i straight to visit him he comes upon a wish fortune is merry and in this mood will give us anything belike they had some notice of the people how i had moved them bring me to octavius these many then shall die their names are pricked he shall not live look with a spot i damn him but lepidus go you to caesar's house fetch the will hither and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies this is a slight unmeritable man meet to be sent on errands is it fit the threefold world divided he should stand one of the three to share it octavius i have seen more days than you and though we lay these honors on this man to ease ourselves of diverse sland'rous loads he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold to groan and sweat under the business either led or driven as we point the way and having brought our treasure where we will then take we down his load and turn him off like to the empty ass to shake his ears and graze in commons so is my horse octavius and for that i do appoint him store of provender it is a creature that i teach to fight to wind to stop to run directly on his corporal motion governed by my spirit and in some taste is lepidus but so he must be taught and trained and bid go forth  a barren spirited fellow one that feeds on objects arts and imitations which out of use and staled by other men begin his fashion do not talk of him but as a property and now octavius listen great things brutus and cassius are levying powers we must straight make head therefore let our alliance be combined our best friends made our means stretched and let us presently go sit in council how covert matters may be best disclosed and open perils surest answer\u00e8d tut i am in their bosoms and i know wherefore they do it they could be content to visit other places and come down with fearful bravery thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage but 'tis not so octavius lead your battle softly on upon the left hand of the even field why do you cross me in this exigent no caesar we will answer on their charge make forth the generals would have some words in your bad strokes brutus you give good words witness the hole you made in caesar's heart crying long live hail caesar not stingless too villains you did not so when your vile daggers hacked one another in the sides of caesar you showed your teeth like apes and fawned like hounds and bowed like bondmen kissing caesar's feet whilst damn\u00e8d casca like a cur behind struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers old cassius still where is he this is not brutus friend but i assure you a prize no less in worth keep this man safe give him all kindness i had rather have such men my friends than enemies go on and see whe'er brutus be alive or dead and bring us word unto octavius' tent how everything is chanced this was the noblest roman of them all all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar he only in a general honest thought and common good to all made one of them his life was gentle and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world this was a man"}
