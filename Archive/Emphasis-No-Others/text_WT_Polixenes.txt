nine changes of the wat'ry star hath been the shepherd's note since we have left our throne without a burden time as long again would be filled up my brother with our thanks and yet we should for perpetuity go hence in debt and therefore like a cipher yet standing in rich place i multiply with one we thank you many thousands more that go before it sir that's tomorrow i am questioned by my fears of what may chance or breed upon our absence that may blow no sneaping winds at home to make us say this is put forth too truly besides i have stayed to tire your royalty no longer stay very sooth tomorrow press me not beseech you so there is no tongue that moves none none i' th' world so soon as yours could win me so it should now were there necessity in your request although 'twere needful i denied it my affairs do even drag me homeward which to hinder were in your love a whip to me my stay to you a charge and trouble to save both farewell our brother no madam i may not verily your guest then madam to be your prisoner should import offending which is for me less easy to commit than you to punish we were fair queen two lads that thought there was no more behind but such a day tomorrow as today and to be boy eternal we were as twinned lambs that did frisk i' th' sun and bleat the one at th' other what we changed was innocence for innocence we knew not the doctrine of ill doing nor dreamed that any did had we pursued that life and our weak spirits ne'er been higher reared with stronger blood we should have answered heaven boldly not guilty the imposition cleared hereditary ours o my most sacred lady temptations have since then been born to 's for in those unfledged days was my wife a girl your precious self had then not crossed the eyes of my young playfellow what means sicilia how my lord if at home sir he's all my exercise my mirth my matter now my sworn friend and then mine enemy my parasite my soldier statesman all he makes a july's day short as december and with his varying childness cures in me thoughts that would thick my blood this is strange methinks my favor here begins to warp not speak  good day camillo what is the news i' th' court the king hath on him such a countenance as he had lost some province and a region loved as he loves himself even now i met him with customary compliment when he wafting his eyes to th' contrary and falling a lip of much contempt speeds from me and so leaves me to consider what is breeding that changes thus his manners how dare not do not do you know and dare not be intelligent to me 'tis thereabouts for to yourself what you do know you must and cannot say you dare not good camillo your changed complexions are to me a mirror which shows me mine changed too for i must be a party in this alteration finding myself thus altered with 't how caught of me make me not sighted like the basilisk i have looked on thousands who have sped the better by my regard but killed none so camillo as you are certainly a gentleman thereto clerklike experienced which no less adorns our gentry than our parents' noble names in whose success we are gentle i beseech you if you know aught which does behoove my knowledge thereof to be informed imprison 't not in ignorant concealment a sickness caught of me and yet i well i must be answered dost thou hear camillo i conjure thee by all the parts of man which honor does acknowledge whereof the least is not this suit of mine that thou declare what incidency thou dost guess of harm is creeping toward me how far off how near which way to be prevented if to be if not how best to bear it on good camillo by whom camillo for what o then my best blood turn to an infected jelly and my name be yoked with his that did betray the best turn then my freshest reputation to a savor that may strike the dullest nostril where i arrive and my approach be shunned nay hated too worse than the great'st infection that e'er was heard or read how should this grow i do believe thee i saw his heart in 's face give me thy hand be pilot to me and thy places shall still neighbor mine my ships are ready and my people did expect my hence departure two days ago this jealousy is for a precious creature as she's rare must it be great and as his person's mighty must it be violent and as he does conceive he is dishonored by a man which ever professed to him why his revenges must in that be made more bitter fear o'ershades me good expedition be my friend and comfort the gracious queen part of his theme but nothing of his ill ta'en suspicion come camillo i will respect thee as a father if thou bear'st my life off hence let us avoid i pray thee good camillo be no more importunate 'tis a sickness denying thee anything a death to grant this as thou lov'st me camillo wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now the need i have of thee thine own goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want thee thou having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if i have not enough considered as too much i cannot to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships of that fatal country sicilia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou call'st him and reconciled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented say to me when sawst thou the prince florizell my son kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues i have considered so much camillo and with some care so far that i have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom i have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbors is grown into an unspeakable estate that's likewise part of my intelligence but i fear the angle that plucks our son thither thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity i think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither prithee be my present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of sicilia my best camillo we must disguise ourselves shepherdess  a fair one are you well you fit our ages with flowers of winter wherefore gentle maiden do you neglect them say there be yet nature is made better by no mean but nature makes that mean so over that art which you say adds to nature is an art that nature makes you see sweet maid we marry a gentler scion to the wildest stock and make conceive a bark of baser kind by bud of nobler race this is an art which does mend nature change it rather but the art itself is nature then make your garden rich in gillyvors and do not call them bastards this is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever ran on the greensward nothing she does or seems but smacks of something greater than herself too noble for this place pray good shepherd what fair swain is this which dances with your daughter she dances featly this is a brave fellow you weary those that refresh us pray let's see these four threes of herdsmen o father you'll know more of that hereafter is it not too far gone 'tis time to part them he's simple and tells much how now fair shepherd your heart is full of something that does take your mind from feasting sooth when i was young and handed love as you do i was wont to load my she with knacks i would have ransacked the peddler's silken treasury and have poured it to her acceptance you have let him go and nothing marted with him if your lass interpretation should abuse and call this your lack of love or bounty you were straited for a reply at least if you make a care of happy holding her what follows this  how prettily th' young swain seems to wash the hand was fair before i have put you out but to your protestation let me hear what you profess and this my neighbor too fairly offered soft swain awhile beseech you have you a father knows he of this methinks a father is at the nuptial of his son a guest that best becomes the table pray you once more is not your father grown incapable of reasonable affairs is he not stupid with age and alt'ring rheums can he speak hear know man from man dispute his own estate lies he not bedrid and again does nothing but what he did being childish by my white beard you offer him if this be so a wrong something unfilial reason my son should choose himself a wife but as good reason the father all whose joy is nothing else but fair posterity should hold some counsel in such a business let him know 't prithee let him mark your divorce young sir whom son i dare not call thou art too base to be acknowledged thou a scepter's heir that thus affects a sheep hook thou old traitor i am sorry that by hanging thee i can but shorten thy life one week and thou fresh piece of excellent witchcraft whom of force must know the royal fool thou cop'st with  i'll have thy beauty scratched with briers and made more homely than thy state for thee fond boy if i may ever know thou dost but sigh that thou no more shalt see this knack as never i mean thou shalt we'll bar thee from succession not hold thee of our blood no not our kin far'r than deucalion off mark thou my words follow us to the court thou churl for this time though full of our displeasure yet we free thee from the dead blow of it and you enchantment worthy enough a herdsman yea him too that makes himself but for our honor therein unworthy thee if ever henceforth thou these rural latches to his entrance open or hoop his body more with thy embraces i will devise a death as cruel for thee as thou art tender to 't o not by much dear my brother let him that was the cause of this have power to take off so much grief from you as he will piece up in himself masterly done the very life seems warm upon her lip she embraces him ay and make it manifest where she has lived or how stol'n from the dead
