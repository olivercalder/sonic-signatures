thou basest thing avoid hence from my sight if after this command thou fraught the court with thy unworthiness thou diest away thou 'rt poison to my blood o disloyal thing that shouldst repair my youth thou heap'st a year's age on me past grace obedience that mightst have had the sole son of my queen thou took'st a beggar wouldst have made my throne a seat for baseness o thou vile one what art thou mad thou foolish thing they were again together you have done not after our command away with her and pen her up nay let her languish a drop of blood a day and being aged die of this folly attend you here the door of our stern daughter will she not forth the exile of her minion is too new she hath not yet forgot him some more time must wear the print of his remembrance on 't and then she's yours a worthy fellow albeit he comes on angry purpose now but that's no fault of his we must receive him according to the honor of his sender and towards himself his goodness forespent on us we must extend our notice our dear son when you have given good morning to your mistress attend the queen and us we shall have need t' employ you towards this roman come our queen now say what would augustus caesar with us son let your mother end you must know till the injurious romans did extort this tribute from us we were free caesar's ambition which swelled so much that it did almost stretch the sides o' th' world against all color here did put the yoke upon 's which to shake off becomes a warlike people whom we reckon ourselves to be we do say then to caesar our ancestor was that mulmutius which ordained our laws whose use the sword of caesar hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise shall by the power we hold be our good deed though rome be therefore angry mulmutius made our laws who was the first of britain which did put his brows within a golden crown and called himself a king thou art welcome caius thy caesar knighted me my youth i spent much under him of him i gathered honor which he to seek of me again perforce behooves me keep at utterance i am perfect that the pannonians and dalmatians for their liberties are now in arms a precedent which not to read would show the britons cold so caesar shall not find them i know your master's pleasure and he mine all the remain is welcome thus far and so farewell our subjects sir will not endure his yoke and for ourself to show less sovereignty than they must needs appear unkinglike my lords you are appointed for that office the due of honor in no point omit  so farewell noble lucius leave not the worthy lucius good my lords till he have crossed the severn happiness lucius hath wrote already to the emperor how it goes here it fits us therefore ripely our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness the powers that he already hath in gallia will soon be drawn to head from whence he moves his war for britain our expectation that it would be thus hath made us forward but my gentle queen where is our daughter she hath not appeared before the roman nor to us hath tendered the duty of the day she looks us like a thing more made of malice than of duty we have noted it call her before us for we have been too slight in sufferance where is she sir how can her contempt be answered her doors locked not seen of late grant heavens that which i fear prove false again and bring me word how 'tis with her a fever with the absence of her son a madness of which her life's in danger heavens how deeply you at once do touch me imogen the great part of my comfort gone my queen upon a desperate bed and in a time when fearful wars point at me her son gone so needful for this present it strikes me past the hope of comfort but for thee fellow who needs must know of her departure and dost seem so ignorant we'll enforce it from thee by a sharp torture the time is troublesome we'll slip you for a season but our jealousy does yet depend now for the counsel of my son and queen i am amazed with matter i thank you let's withdraw and meet the time as it seeks us we fear not what can from italy annoy us but we grieve at chances here away stand by my side you whom the gods have made preservers of my throne woe is my heart that the poor soldier that so richly fought whose rags shamed gilded arms whose naked breast stepped before targes of proof cannot be found he shall be happy that can find him if our grace can make him so no tidings of him to my grief i am the heir of his reward which i will add to you the liver heart and brain of britain by whom i grant she lives 'tis now the time to ask of whence you are report it bow your knees arise my knights o' th' battle i create you companions to our person and will fit you with dignities becoming your estates there's business in these faces why so sadly greet you our victory you look like romans and not o' th' court of britain who worse than a physician would this report become but i consider by med'cine life may be prolonged yet death will seize the doctor too how ended she prithee say she alone knew this and but she spoke it dying i would not believe her lips in opening it proceed o most delicate fiend who is 't can read a woman is there more heard you all this her women mine eyes were not in fault for she was beautiful mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart that thought her like her seeming it had been vicious to have mistrusted her yet o my daughter that it was folly in me thou mayst say and prove it in thy feeling heaven mend all thou com'st not caius now for tribute that the britons have razed out though with the loss of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit that their good souls may be appeased with slaughter of you their captives which ourself have granted so think of your estate i have surely seen him his favor is familiar to me boy thou hast looked thyself into my grace and art mine own i know not why wherefore to say live boy ne'er thank thy master live and ask of cymbeline what boon thou wilt fitting my bounty and thy state i'll give it yea though thou do demand a prisoner the noblest ta'en what would'st thou boy i love thee more and more think more and more what's best to ask know'st him thou look'st on speak wilt have him live is he thy kin thy friend wherefore ey'st him so ay with all my heart and lend my best attention what's thy name thou 'rt my good youth my page i'll be thy master walk with me speak freely come stand thou by our side make thy demand aloud sir step you forth give answer to this boy and do it freely or by our greatness and the grace of it which is our honor bitter torture shall winnow the truth from falsehood on speak to him that diamond upon your finger say how came it yours how me all that belongs to this my daughter what of her renew thy strength i had rather thou shouldst live while nature will than die ere i hear more strive man and speak i stand on fire come to the matter nay nay to th' purpose does the world go round if this be so the gods do mean to strike me to death with mortal joy the tune of imogen new matter still what's this cornelius how now my flesh my child what mak'st thou me a dullard in this act wilt thou not speak to me my tears that fall prove holy water on thee imogen thy mother's dead o she was naught and long of her it was that we meet here so strangely but her son is gone we know not how nor where marry the gods forfend i would not thy good deeds should from my lips pluck a hard sentence prithee valiant youth deny 't again he was a prince i am sorrow for thee by thine own tongue thou art condemned and must endure our law thou 'rt dead bind the offender and take him from our presence why old soldier wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for by tasting of our wrath how of descent as good as we and thou shalt die for 't what of him he is a banished traitor take him hence the whole world shall not save him nursing of my sons how my issue thou weep'st and speak'st the service that you three have done is more unlike than this thou tell'st i lost my children if these be they i know not how to wish a pair of worthier sons guiderius had upon his neck a mole a sanguine star it was a mark of wonder o what am i a mother to the birth of three ne'er mother rejoiced deliverance more blest pray you be that after this strange starting from your orbs you may reign in them now o imogen thou hast lost by this a kingdom did you e'er meet o rare instinct when shall i hear all through this fierce abridgment hath to it circumstantial branches which distinction should be rich in where how lived you and when came you to serve our roman captive how parted with your brothers how first met them why fled you from the court and whither these and your three motives to the battle with i know not how much more should be demanded and all the other by dependences from chance to chance but nor the time nor place will serve our long interrogatories see posthumus anchors upon imogen and she like harmless lightning throws her eye on him her brothers me her master hitting each object with a joy the counterchange is severally in all let's quit this ground and smoke the temple with our sacrifices thou art my brother so we'll hold thee ever all o'erjoyed save these in bonds let them be joyful too for they shall taste our comfort the forlorn soldier that so nobly fought he would have well becomed this place and graced the thankings of a king nobly doomed we'll learn our freeness of a son in law pardon's the word to all this hath some seeming well my peace we will begin and caius lucius although the victor we submit to caesar and to the roman empire promising to pay our wonted tribute from the which we were dissuaded by our wicked queen whom heavens in justice both on her and hers have laid most heavy hand laud we the gods and let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils from our blest altars publish we this peace to all our subjects set we forward let a roman and a british ensign wave friendly together so through lud's town march and in the temple of great jupiter our peace we'll ratify seal it with feasts set on there never was a war did cease ere bloody hands were washed with such a peace
