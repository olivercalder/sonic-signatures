always obedient to your grace's will i come to know your pleasure now good my lord let there be some more test made of my mettle before so noble and so great a figure be stamped upon it yet give leave my lord that we may bring you something on the way the heavens give safety to your purposes 'tis so with me let us withdraw together and we may soon our satisfaction have touching that point we must not make a scarecrow of the law setting it up to fear the birds of prey and let it keep one shape till custom make it their perch and not their terror 'tis one thing to be tempted escalus another thing to fall i not deny the jury passing on the prisoner's life may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try what's open made to justice that justice seizes what knows the laws that thieves do pass on thieves 'tis very pregnant the jewel that we find we stoop and take 't because we see it but what we do not see we tread upon and never think of it you may not so extenuate his offense for i have had such faults but rather tell me when i that censure him do so offend let mine own judgment pattern out my death and nothing come in partial sir he must die where is the provost see that claudio be executed by nine tomorrow morning bring him his confessor let him be prepared for that's the utmost of his pilgrimage how now sir what's your name and what's the matter benefactors well what benefactors are they are they not malefactors go to what quality are they of elbow is your name why dost thou not speak elbow what are you sir this will last out a night in russia when nights are longest there i'll take my leave and leave you to the hearing of the cause hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all now what's the matter provost did not i tell thee yea hadst thou not order why dost thou ask again go to let that be mine do you your office or give up your place and you shall well be spared dispose of her to some more fitter place and that with speed hath he a sister well let her be admitted see you the fornicatress be removed let her have needful but not lavish means there shall be order for 't stay a little while you're welcome what's your will well what's your suit well the matter condemn the fault and not the actor of it why every fault's condemned ere it be done mine were the very cipher of a function to fine the faults whose fine stands in record and let go by the actor maiden no remedy i will not do 't look what i will not that i cannot do he's sentenced 'tis too late pray you begone your brother is a forfeit of the law and you but waste your words be you content fair maid it is the law not i condemn your brother were he my kinsman brother or my son it should be thus with him he must die tomorrow the law hath not been dead though it hath slept those many had not dared to do that evil if the first that did th' edict infringe had answered for his deed now 'tis awake takes note of what is done and like a prophet looks in a glass that shows what future evils  either now or by remissness new conceived and so in progress to be hatched and born  are now to have no successive degrees but ere they live to end i show it most of all when i show justice for then i pity those i do not know which a dismissed offense would after gall and do him right that answering one foul wrong lives not to act another be satisfied your brother dies tomorrow be content why do you put these sayings upon me she speaks and 'tis such sense that my sense breeds with it fare you well i will bethink me come again tomorrow how bribe me well come to me tomorrow amen for i am that way going to temptation where prayers cross at any time 'fore noon from thee even from thy virtue what's this what's this is this her fault or mine the tempter or the tempted who sins most ha not she nor doth she tempt but it is i that lying by the violet in the sun do as the carrion does not as the flower corrupt with virtuous season can it be that modesty may more betray our sense than woman's lightness having waste ground enough shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie what dost thou or what art thou angelo dost thou desire her foully for those things that make her good o let her brother live thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves what do i love her that i desire to hear her speak again and feast upon her eyes what is 't i dream on o cunning enemy that to catch a saint with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet with all her double vigor art and nature once stir my temper but this virtuous maid subdues me quite ever till now when men were fond i smiled and wondered how when i would pray and think i think and pray to several subjects heaven hath my empty words whilst my invention hearing not my tongue anchors on isabel god in my mouth as if i did but only chew his name and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception the state whereon i studied is like a good thing being often read grown sere and tedious yea my gravity wherein let no man hear me i take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain o place o form how often dost thou with thy case thy habit wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming blood thou art blood let's write good angel on the devil's horn 'tis not the devil's crest how now who's there teach her the way o heavens why does my blood thus muster to my heart making both it unable for itself and dispossessing all my other parts of necessary fitness so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons come all to help him and so stop the air by which he should revive and even so the general subject to a well wished king quit their own part and in obsequious fondness crowd to his presence where their untaught love must needs appear offense how now fair maid that you might know it would much better please me than to demand what 'tis your brother cannot live yet may he live a while and it may be as long as you or i yet he must die yea ha fie these filthy vices it were as good to pardon him that hath from nature stolen a man already made as to remit their saucy sweetness that do coin god's image in stamps that are forbid 'tis all as easy falsely to take away a life true made as to put metal in restrainèd means to make a false one say you so then i shall pose you quickly which had you rather that the most just law now took your brother's life or to redeem him give up your body to such sweet uncleanness as she that he hath stained i talk not of your soul our compelled sins stand more for number than for accompt nay i'll not warrant that for i can speak against the thing i say answer to this i now the voice of the recorded law pronounce a sentence on your brother's life might there not be a charity in sin to save this brother's life pleased you to do 't at peril of your soul were equal poise of sin and charity nay but hear me your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant or seem so crafty and that's not good thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright when it doth tax itself as these black masks proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder than beauty could displayed but mark me to be receivèd plain i'll speak more gross your brother is to die and his offense is so as it appears accountant to the law upon that pain admit no other way to save his life  as i subscribe not that nor any other  but in the loss of question that you his sister finding yourself desired of such a person whose credit with the judge or own great place could fetch your brother from the manacles of the law and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed or else to let him suffer what would you do then must your brother die were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slandered so you seemed of late to make the law a tyrant and rather proved the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice we are all frail nay women are frail too i think it well and from this testimony of your own sex since i suppose we are made to be no stronger than faults may shake our frames let me be bold i do arrest your words be that you are  that is a woman if you be more you're none if you be one as you are well expressed by all external warrants show it now by putting on the destined livery plainly conceive i love you he shall not isabel if you give me love believe me on mine honor my words express my purpose who will believe thee isabel my unsoiled name th' austereness of my life my vouch against you and my place i' th' state will so your accusation overweigh that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny i have begun and now i give my sensual race the rein fit thy consent to my sharp appetite lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will or else he must not only die the death but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to ling'ring sufferance answer me tomorrow or by the affection that now guides me most i'll prove a tyrant to him as for you say what you can my false o'erweighs your true in most uneven and distracted manner his actions show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted and why meet him at the gates and deliver our authorities there and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the street well i beseech you let it be proclaimed betimes i' th' morn i'll call you at your house give notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet him good night this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant and dull to all proceedings a deflowered maid and by an eminent body that enforced the law against it but that her tender shame will not proclaim against her maiden loss how might she tongue me yet reason dares her no for my authority bears of a credent bulk that no particular scandal once can touch but it confounds the breather he should have lived save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense might in the times to come have ta'en revenge by so receiving a dishonored life with ransom of such shame would yet he had lived alack when once our grace we have forgot nothing goes right we would and we would not happy return be to your royal grace you make my bonds still greater my lord her wits i fear me are not firm she hath been a suitor to me for her brother cut off by course of justice and she will speak most bitterly and strange charges she more than me this is a strange abuse let's see thy face my lord i must confess i know this woman and five years since there was some speech of marriage betwixt myself and her which was broke off partly for that her promisèd proportions came short of composition but in chief for that her reputation was disvalued in levity since which time of five years i never spake with her saw her nor heard from her upon my faith and honor i did but smile till now now good my lord give me the scope of justice my patience here is touched i do perceive these poor informal women are no more but instruments of some more mightier member that sets them on let me have way my lord to find this practice out what can you vouch against him signior lucio is this the man that you did tell us of hark how the villain would close now after his treasonable abuses what resists he help him lucio o my dread lord i should be guiltier than my guiltiness to think i can be undiscernible when i perceive your grace like power divine hath looked upon my passes then good prince no longer session hold upon my shame but let my trial be mine own confession immediate sentence then and sequent death is all the grace i beg i was my lord i am sorry that such sorrow i procure and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart that i crave death more willingly than mercy 'tis my deserving and i do entreat it
