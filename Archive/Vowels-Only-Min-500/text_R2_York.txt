whose venom sound the open ear of youth doth always listen report of fashions in proud italy whose manners still our tardy apish nation limps after in base imitation where doth the world thrust forth a vanity  so it be new there's no respect how vile  that is not quickly buzzed into his ears then all too late comes counsel to be heard where will doth mutiny with wit's regard direct not him whose way himself will choose 'tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou lose the king is come deal mildly with his youth for young hot colts being reined do rage the more i do beseech your majesty impute his words to wayward sickliness and age in him he loves you on my life and holds you dear as harry duke of hereford were he here be york the next that must be bankrupt so though death be poor it ends a mortal woe how long shall i be patient ah how long shall tender duty make me suffer wrong not gloucester's death nor hereford's banishment nor gaunt's rebukes nor england's private wrongs nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke about his marriage nor my own disgrace have ever made me sour my patient cheek or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face i am the last of noble edward's sons of whom thy father prince of wales was first in war was never lion raged more fierce in peace was never gentle lamb more mild than was that young and princely gentleman his face thou hast for even so looked he accomplished with the number of thy hours but when he frowned it was against the french and not against his friends his noble hand did win what he did spend and spent not that which his triumphant father's hand had won his hands were guilty of no kindred blood but bloody with the enemies of his kin o richard york is too far gone with grief or else he never would compare between o my liege pardon me if you please if not i pleased not to be pardoned am content withal seek you to seize and gripe into your hands the royalties and rights of banished hereford is not gaunt dead and doth not hereford live was not gaunt just and is not harry true did not the one deserve to have an heir is not his heir a well deserving son take hereford's rights away and take from time his charters and his customary rights let not tomorrow then ensue today be not thyself for how art thou a king but by fair sequence and succession now afore god god forbid i say true  if you do wrongfully seize hereford's rights call in the letters patents that he hath by his attorneys general to sue his livery and deny his offered homage you pluck a thousand dangers on your head you lose a thousand well disposèd hearts and prick my tender patience to those thoughts which honor and allegiance cannot think i'll not be by the while my liege farewell what will ensue hereof there's none can tell but by bad courses may be understood that their events can never fall out good should i do so i should belie my thoughts comfort's in heaven and we are on the earth where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief your husband he is gone to save far off whilst others come to make him lose at home here am i left to underprop his land who weak with age cannot support myself now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made now shall he try his friends that flattered him he was why so go all which way it will the nobles they are fled the commons they are cold and will i fear revolt on hereford's side sirrah get thee to plashy to my sister gloucester bid her send me presently a thousand pound hold take my ring what is 't knave god for his mercy what a tide of woes comes rushing on this woeful land at once

uncle me no uncle i am no traitor's uncle and that word grace in an ungracious mouth is but profane why have those banished and forbidden legs dared once to touch a dust of england's ground but then more why why have they dared to march so many miles upon her peaceful bosom frighting her pale faced villages with war and ostentation of despisèd arms com'st thou because the anointed king is hence why foolish boy the king is left behind and in my loyal bosom lies his power were i but now lord of such hot youth as when brave gaunt thy father and myself rescued the black prince that young mars of men from forth the ranks of many thousand french o then how quickly should this arm of mine now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee and minister correction to thy fault even in condition of the worst degree in gross rebellion and detested treason thou art a banished man and here art come before the expiration of thy time in braving arms against thy sovereign my lords of england let me tell you this i have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs and labored all i could to do him right but in this kind to come in braving arms be his own carver and cut out his way to find out right with wrong it may not be and you that do abet him in this kind cherish rebellion and are rebels all well well i see the issue of these arms i cannot mend it i must needs confess because my power is weak and all ill left but if i could by him that gave me life i would attach you all and make you stoop unto the sovereign mercy of the king but since i cannot be it known unto you i do remain as neuter so fare you well  unless you please to enter in the castle and there repose you for this night it may be i will go with you but yet i'll pause for i am loath to break our country's laws nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are things past redress are now with me past care a gentleman of mine i have dispatched with letters of your love to her at large it would beseem the lord northumberland to say king richard alack the heavy day when such a sacred king should hide his head the time hath been would you have been so brief with him he would have been so brief to shorten you for taking so the head your whole head's length take not good cousin further than you should lest you mistake the heavens are over our heads yet looks he like a king behold his eye as bright as is the eagle's lightens forth controlling majesty alack alack for woe that any harm should stain so fair a show great duke of lancaster i come to thee from plume plucked richard who with willing soul adopts thee heir and his high scepter yields to the possession of thy royal hand ascend his throne descending now from him and long live henry fourth of that name i will be his conduct to do that office of thine own goodwill which tired majesty did make thee offer the resignation of thy state and crown to henry bolingbroke where did i leave then as i said the duke great bolingbroke mounted upon a hot and fiery steed which his aspiring rider seemed to know with slow but stately pace kept on his course whilst all tongues cried god save thee bolingbroke you would have thought the very windows spake so many greedy looks of young and old through casements darted their desiring eyes upon his visage and that all the walls with painted imagery had said at once jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke whilst he from the one side to the other turning bareheaded lower than his proud steed's neck bespake them thus i thank you countrymen and thus still doing thus he passed along as in a theater the eyes of men after a well graced actor leaves the stage are idly bent on him that enters next thinking his prattle to be tedious even so or with much more contempt men's eyes did scowl on gentle richard no man cried god save him no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home but dust was thrown upon his sacred head which with such gentle sorrow he shook off his face still combating with tears and smiles the badges of his grief and patience that had not god for some strong purpose steeled the hearts of men they must perforce have melted and barbarism itself have pitied him but heaven hath a hand in these events to whose high will we bound our calm contents to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now whose state and honor i for aye allow aumerle that was but that is lost for being richard's friend and madam you must call him rutland now i am in parliament pledge for his truth and lasting fealty to the new made king well bear you well in this new spring of time lest you be cropped before you come to prime
