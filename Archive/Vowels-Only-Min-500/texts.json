though myself have been an idle truant omitting the sweet benefit of time to clothe mine age with angel like perfection yet hath sir proteus for that's his name  made use and fair advantage of his days his years but young but his experience old his head unmellowed but his judgment ripe and in a word for far behind his worth comes all the praises that i now bestow  he is complete in feature and in mind with all good grace to grace a gentleman should i have wished a thing it had been he this is the gentleman i told your ladyship had come along with me but that his mistress did hold his eyes locked in her crystal looks nay sure i think she holds them prisoners still why lady love hath twenty pair of eyes to see such lovers thurio as yourself upon a homely object love can wink welcome dear

contemning love whose high imperious thoughts have punished me with bitter fasts with penitential groans with nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs for in revenge of my contempt of love love hath chased sleep from my enthrall\u00e8d eyes and made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow o gentle proteus love's a mighty lord and hath so humbled me as i confess there is no woe to his correction nor to his service no such joy on earth now no discourse except it be of love now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep upon the very naked name of love even she and is she not a heavenly saint call her divine o flatter me for love delights in praises then speak the truth by her if not divine yet let her be a principality sovereign to all the creatures on the earth sweet except not any except thou wilt except against my love and i will help thee to prefer her too she shall be dignified with this high honor  to bear my lady's train lest the base earth should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss and of so great a favor growing proud disdain to root the summer swelling flower and make rough winter everlastingly pardon me proteus all i can is nothing to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing she is alone  not for the world why man she is mine own and i as rich in having such a jewel as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl the water nectar and the rocks pure gold forgive me that i do not dream on thee because thou seest me dote upon my love my foolish rival that her father likes only for his possessions are so huge is gone with her along and i must after for love thou know'st is full of jealousy ay and we are betrothed nay more our marriage hour with all the cunning manner of our flight determined of how i must climb her window the ladder made of cords and all the means plotted and 'greed on for my happiness good proteus go with me to my chamber in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel will you make haste please it your grace there is a messenger that stays to bear my letters to my friends and i am going to deliver them the tenor of them doth but signify my health and happy being at your court i know it well my lord and sure the match were rich and honorable besides the gentleman is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter cannot your grace win her to fancy him what would your grace have me to do in this win her with gifts if she respect not words dumb jewels often in their silent kind more than quick words do move a woman's mind a woman sometime scorns what best contents her send her another never give her o'er for scorn at first makes after love the more if she do frown 'tis not in hate of you but rather to beget more love in you if she do chide 'tis not to have you gone forwhy the fools are mad if left alone take no repulse whatever she doth say for get you gone she doth not mean away flatter and praise commend extol their graces though ne'er so black say they have angels' faces that man that hath a tongue i say is no man if with his tongue he cannot win a woman why then i would resort to her by night what lets but one may enter at her window why then a ladder quaintly made of cords to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks would serve to scale another hero's tower so bold leander would adventure it when would you use it pray sir tell me that by seven o'clock i'll get you such a ladder it will be light my lord that you may bear it under a cloak that is of any length ay my good lord why any cloak will serve the turn my lord and why not death rather than living torment to die is to be banished from myself and sylvia is myself banished from her is self from self a deadly banishment what light is light if sylvia be not seen what joy is joy if sylvia be not by  unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection except i be by sylvia in the night there is no music in the nightingale unless i look on sylvia in the day there is no day for me to look upon she is my essence and i leave to be if i be not by her fair influence fostered illumined cherished kept alive i fly not death to fly his deadly doom tarry i here i but attend on death but fly i hence i fly away from life no neither nothing my ears are stopped and cannot hear good news so much of bad already hath possessed them is sylvia dead no valentine indeed for sacred sylvia hath she forsworn me no valentine if sylvia have forsworn me what is your news o i have fed upon this woe already and now excess of it will make me surfeit doth sylvia know that i am banish\u00e8d no more unless the next word that thou speak'st have some malignant power upon my life if so i pray thee breathe it in mine ear as ending anthem of my endless dolor i pray thee lance an if thou seest my boy bid him make haste and meet me at the north gate o my dear sylvia hapless valentine my friends  then know that i have little wealth to lose a man i am crossed with adversity my riches are these poor habiliments of which if you should here disfurnish me you take the sum and substance that i have to verona from milan some sixteen months and longer might have stayed if crooked fortune had not thwarted me i was for that which now torments me to rehearse i killed a man whose death i much repent but yet i slew him manfully in fight without false vantage or base treachery i was and held me glad of such a doom my youthful travel therein made me happy or else i often had been miserable peace villain nothing but my fortune i take your offer and will live with you provided that you do no outrages on silly women or poor passengers how use doth breed a habit in a man this shadowy desert unfrequented woods i better brook than flourishing peopled towns here can i sit alone

building fall and leave no memory of what it was repair me with thy presence sylvia thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain what hallowing and what stir is this today these are my mates that make

this i see and hear love lend me patience to forbear awhile ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch thou friend of an ill fashion thou common friend that's without faith or love for such is a friend now treacherous man thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye could have persuaded me now i dare not say i have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me who should be trusted when one's right hand is perjured to the bosom proteus i am sorry i must never trust thee more but count the world a stranger for thy sake the private wound is deepest o time most accursed 'mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst then i am paid and once again i do receive thee honest who by repentance is not satisfied is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased by penitence th' eternal's wrath's appeased and that my love may appear plain and free all that was mine in sylvia i give thee why boy why wag how now what's the matter look up speak come come a hand from either let me be blest to make this happy close 'twere pity two such friends should be long foes forbear forbear i say it is my lord the duke your grace is welcome to a man disgraced banished valentine thurio give back or else embrace thy death come not within the measure of my wrath do not name sylvia thine if once again verona shall not hold thee here she stands take but possession of her with a touch  i dare thee but to breathe upon my love i thank your grace the gift hath made me happy i now beseech you for your daughter's sake to grant one boon that i shall ask of you these banished men that i have kept withal are men endued with worthy qualities forgive them what they have committed here and let them be recalled from their exile they are reform\u00e8d civil full of good and fit for great employment worthy lord

from thee departed thy penitent reformed but we have been deceived in thy integrity deceived in that which seems so to bide upon 't thou art not honest or if thou inclin'st that way thou art a coward

in my true opinion alack for lesser knowledge how accursed in being so blest there may be in the cup a spider steeped and one may drink depart and yet partake no venom for his knowledge is not infected but if one present th' abhorred ingredient to his eye make known how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides with violent hefts i have drunk and seen the spider camillo was his help in this his pander there is a plot against my life my crown all's true that is mistrusted that false villain whom i employed was pre employed by him he has discovered my design and i remain a pinched thing yea a very trick for them to play at will how came the posterns so easily open i know 't too well give me the boy i am glad you did not nurse him though he does bear some signs of me yet you have too much blood in him bear the boy hence he shall not come about her away with him and let her sport herself with that she's big with for 'tis polixenes has made thee swell thus you my lords look on her mark her well be but about to say she is a goodly lady and the justice of your hearts will thereto add 'tis pity she's not honest honorable praise her but for this her without door form which on my faith deserves high speech and straight the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands that calumny doth use o i am out that mercy does for calumny will sear virtue itself these shrugs these s and s when you have said she's goodly come between ere you can say she's honest but be 't known from him that has most cause to grieve it should be she's an adult'ress you have mistook my lady polixenes for leontes o thou thing which i'll not call a creature of thy place lest barbarism making me the precedent should a like language use to all degrees and mannerly distinguishment leave out betwixt the prince and beggar i have said she's an adult'ress i have said with whom more she's a traitor and camillo is a federary with her and one that knows what she should shame to know herself but with her most vile principal that she's a bed swerver even as bad as those that vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy to this their late escape no if i mistake in those foundations which i build upon the center is not big enough to bear a schoolboy's top away with her to prison he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty but that he speaks shall i be heard go do our bidding hence hold your peaces cease no more you smell this business with a sense as cold as is a dead man's nose but i do see 't and feel 't as you feel doing thus and see withal the instruments that feel what lack i credit why what need we commune with you of this but rather follow our forceful instigation our prerogative calls not your counsels but our natural goodness imparts this which if you or stupefied or seeming so in skill cannot or will not relish a truth like us inform yourselves we need no more of your advice the matter the loss the gain the ord'ring on 't is all properly ours how could that be either thou art most ignorant by age or thou wert born a fool camillo's flight added to their familiarity  which was as gross as ever touched conjecture that lacked sight only naught for approbation but only seeing all other circumstances made up to th' deed doth push on this proceeding yet for a greater confirmation  for in an act of this importance 'twere most piteous to be wild i have dispatched in post to sacred delphos to apollo's temple cleomenes and dion whom you know of stuffed sufficiency now from the oracle they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had shall stop or spur me have i done well though i am satisfied and need no more than what i know yet shall the oracle give rest to th' minds of others such as he whose ignorant credulity will not come up to th' truth so have we thought it good from our free person she should be confined lest that the treachery of the two fled hence be left her to perform come follow us we are to speak in public for this business will raise us all nor night nor day no rest it is but weakness to bear the matter thus mere weakness if the cause were not in being part o' th' cause she th' adult'ress for the harlot king is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank and level of my brain plot proof but she i can hook to me say that she were gone given to the fire a moiety of my rest might come to me again who's there how does the boy to see his nobleness conceiving the dishonor of his mother he straight declined drooped took it deeply fastened and fixed the shame on 't in himself threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep and downright languished leave me solely go see how he fares fie fie no thought of him the very thought of my revenges that way recoil upon me in himself too mighty and in his parties his alliance let him be until a time may serve for present vengeance take it on her camillo and polixenes laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow they should not laugh if i could reach them nor shall she within my power what noise there ho how  away with that audacious lady antigonus i charged thee that she should not come about me i knew she would what canst not rule her good queen force her hence out a mankind witch hence with her out o' door a most intelligencing bawd traitors will you not push her out give her the bastard thou dotard thou art woman tired unroosted by thy dame partlet here take up the bastard take 't up i say give 't to thy crone he dreads his wife a nest of traitors a callet of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband and now baits me this brat is none of mine it is the issue of polixenes hence with it and together with the dam commit them to the fire a gross hag  and losel thou art worthy to be hanged that wilt not stay her tongue once more take her hence i'll ha' thee burnt on your allegiance out of the chamber with her were i a tyrant where were her life she durst not call me so if she did know me one away with her thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this my child away with 't even thou that hast a heart so tender o'er it take it hence and see it instantly consumed with fire even thou and none but thou take it up straight within this hour bring me word 'tis done and by good testimony or i'll seize thy life with what thou else call'st thine if thou refuse and wilt encounter with my wrath say so the bastard brains with these my proper hands shall i dash out go take it to the fire for thou sett'st on thy wife you're liars all i am a feather for each wind that blows shall i live on to see this bastard kneel and call me father better burn it now than curse it then but be it let it live it shall not neither you sir come you hither you that have been so tenderly officious with lady margery your midwife there to save this bastard's life for 'tis a bastard so sure as this beard's gray what will you adventure to save this brat's life it shall be possible swear by this sword thou wilt perform my bidding mark and perform it seest thou for the fail of any point in 't shall not only be death to thyself but to thy lewd tongued wife whom for this time we pardon we enjoin thee as thou art liegeman to us that thou carry this female bastard hence and that thou bear it to some remote and desert place quite out of our dominions and that there thou leave it without more mercy to it own protection and favor of the climate as by strange fortune it came to us i do in justice charge thee on thy soul's peril and thy body's torture that thou commend it strangely to some place where chance may nurse or end it take it up no i'll not rear another's issue twenty three days they have been absent 'tis good speed foretells the great apollo suddenly will have the truth of this appear prepare you lords summon a session that we may arraign our most disloyal lady for as she hath been publicly accused so shall she have a just and open trial while she lives my heart will be a burden to me leave me and think upon my bidding this sessions to our great grief we pronounce even pushes 'gainst our heart the party tried the daughter of a king our wife and one of us too much beloved let us be cleared of being tyrannous since we so openly proceed in justice which shall have due course even to the guilt or the purgation produce the prisoner read the indictment i ne'er heard yet that any of these bolder vices wanted less impudence to gainsay what they did than to perform it first you will not own it you knew of his departure as you know what you have underta'en to do in 's absence your actions are my dreams you had a bastard by polixenes and i but dreamed it as you were past all shame  those of your fact are so so past all truth which to deny concerns more than avails for as thy brat hath been cast out like to itself no father owning it which is indeed more criminal in thee than it so thou shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage look for no less than death break up the seals and read hast thou read truth there is no truth at all i' th' oracle the sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood what is the business how gone apollo's angry and the heavens themselves do strike at my injustice how now there take her hence her heart is but o'ercharged she will recover i have too much believed mine own suspicion beseech you tenderly apply to her some remedies for life apollo pardon my great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle i'll reconcile me to polixenes new woo my queen recall the good camillo whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy for being transported by my jealousies to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose camillo for the minister to poison my friend polixenes which had been done but that the good mind of camillo tardied my swift command though i with death and with reward did threaten and encourage him not doing it and being done he most humane and filled with honor to my kingly guest unclasped my practice quit his fortunes here which you knew great and to the hazard of all incertainties himself commended no richer than his honor how he glisters through my rust and how his piety does my deeds make the blacker go on go on thou canst not speak too much i have deserved all tongues to talk their bitt'rest thou didst speak but well when most the truth which i receive much better than to be pitied of thee prithee bring me to the dead bodies of my queen and son one grave shall be for both upon them shall the causes of their death appear unto our shame perpetual once a day i'll visit the chapel where they lie and tears shed there shall be my recreation so long as nature will bear up with this exercise so long i daily vow to use it come and lead me to these sorrows whilst i remember her and her virtues i cannot forget my blemishes in them and so still think of the wrong i did myself which was so much that heirless it hath made my kingdom and destroyed the sweet'st companion that e'er man bred his hopes out of i think so killed she i killed i did so but thou strik'st me sorely to say i did it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now say so but seldom good paulina who hast the memory of hermione i know in honor o that ever i had squared me to thy counsel then even now i might have looked upon my queen's full eyes have taken treasure from her lips  thou speak'st truth no more such wives therefore no wife one worse and better used would make her sainted spirit again possess her corpse and on this stage where we offenders now appear soul vexed and begin why to me she had and would incense me to murder her i married stars stars and all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wife i'll have no wife paulina never paulina so be blest my spirit my true paulina we shall not marry till thou bid'st us what with him he comes not like to his father's greatness his approach so out of circumstance and sudden tells us 'tis not a visitation framed but forced by need and accident what train his princess say you with him go cleomenes yourself assisted with your honored friends bring them to our embracement still 'tis strange he thus should steal upon us prithee no more cease thou know'st he dies to me again when talked of sure when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches will bring me to consider that which may unfurnish me of reason they are come your mother was most true to wedlock prince for she did print your royal father off conceiving you were i but twenty one your father's image is so hit in you his very air that i should call you brother as i did him and speak of something wildly by us performed before most dearly welcome and your fair princess goddess o alas i lost a couple that 'twixt heaven and earth might thus have stood begetting wonder as you gracious couple do and then i lost  all mine own folly the society amity too of your brave father whom though bearing misery i desire my life once more to look on him o my brother good gentleman the wrongs i have done thee stir afresh within me and these thy offices so rarely kind are as interpreters of my behindhand slackness welcome hither as is the spring to th' earth and hath he too exposed this paragon to th' fearful usage at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune to greet a man not worth her pains much less th' adventure of her person where the warlike smalus that noble honored lord is feared and loved the bless\u00e8d gods purge all infection from our air whilst you do climate here you have a holy father a graceful gentleman against whose person so sacred as it is i have done sin for which the heavens taking angry note have left me issueless and your father's blest as he from heaven merits it with you worthy his goodness what might i have been might i a son and daughter now have looked on such goodly things as you where's bohemia speak who camillo you are married my lord is this the daughter of a king that once i see by your good father's speed will come on very slowly i am sorry most sorry you have broken from his liking where you were tied in duty and as sorry your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty that you might well enjoy her would he do so i'd beg your precious mistress which he counts but a trifle i thought of her even in these looks i made but your petition is yet unanswered i will to your father your honor not o'erthrown by your desires i am friend to them and you upon which errand i now go toward him therefore follow me and mark what way i make come good my lord o grave and good paulina the great comfort that i have had of thee o paulina we honor you with trouble but we came to see the statue of our queen your gallery have we passed through not without much content in many singularities but we saw not that which my daughter came to look upon the statue of her mother her natural posture  chide me dear stone that i may say indeed thou art hermione or rather thou art she in thy not chiding for she was as tender as infancy and grace but yet paulina hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing so ag\u00e8d as this seems as now she might have done so much to my good comfort as it is now piercing to my soul o thus she stood even with such life of majesty warm life as now it coldly stands when first i wooed her i am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me for being more stone than it o royal piece there's magic in thy majesty which has my evils conjured to remembrance and from thy admiring daughter took the spirits standing like stone with thee do not draw the curtain let be let be would i were dead but that methinks already  what was he that did make it see my lord would you not deem it breathed and that those veins did verily bear blood the fixture of her eye has motion in 't as we are mocked with art o sweet paulina make me to think so twenty years together no settled senses of the world can match the pleasure of that madness let 't alone do paulina for this affliction has a taste as sweet as any cordial comfort still methinks there is an air comes from her what fine chisel could ever yet

perceive here a divided duty to you i am bound for life and education my life and education both do learn me how to respect you you are the lord of duty i am hitherto your daughter but here's my

impatient thoughts by being in his eye most gracious duke to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice t' assist my simpleness that i love the moor to live with him my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world my heart's subdued even to the very quality of my lord i saw othello's visage in his mind and to his honors and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate so that dear lords if i be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the war the rites for why i love him are bereft me and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence let me go with him i thank you valiant cassio what tidings can you tell of my lord o but i fear how lost you company alas she has no speech oh fie upon thee slanderer what wouldst write of me if thou shouldst praise me come on assay there's one gone to the harbor i am not merry but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise  come how wouldst thou praise me well praised how if she be black and witty worse and worse these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' th' alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself to do what o most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn of him emilia though he be thy husband how say you cassio is he not a most profane and liberal counselor let's meet him and receive him my dear othello the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase even as our days do grow what is the matter dear be thou assured good cassio i will do all my abilities in thy behalf o that's an honest fellow do not doubt cassio but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were i know 't i thank you you do love my lord you have known him long and be you well assured he shall in strangeness stand no farther off than in a politic distance do not doubt that before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee if i do vow a friendship i'll perform it to the last article my lord shall never rest i'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift i'll intermingle everything he does with cassio's suit therefore be merry cassio for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away why stay and hear me speak well do your discretion how now my lord i have been talking with a suitor here a man that languishes in your displeasure why your lieutenant cassio good my lord if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take for if he be not one that truly loves you that errs in ignorance and not in cunning i have no judgment in an honest face i prithee call him back yes faith so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him good love call him back but shall 't be shortly shall 't be tonight at supper tomorrow dinner then why then tomorrow night or tuesday morn on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn i prithee name the time but let it not exceed three days in faith he's penitent and yet his trespass in our common reason  save that they say the wars must make example out of her best is not almost a fault t' incur a private check when shall he come tell me othello i wonder in my soul what you would ask me that i should deny or stand so mamm'ring on what michael cassio that came a wooing with you and so many a time when i have spoke of you dispraisingly hath ta'en your part to have so much to do to bring him in by 'r lady i could do much  why this is not a boon 'tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person nay when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted shall i deny you no farewell my lord emilia come be as your fancies teach you whate'er you be i am obedient how now my dear othello your dinner and the generous islanders by you invited do attend your presence why do you speak so faintly are you not well faith that's with watching 'twill away again let me but bind it hard within this hour it will be well i am very sorry that you are not well do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies why man go to where lodges he can anything be made of this can you inquire him out and be edified by report seek him bid him come hither tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well where should i lose that handkerchief emilia believe me i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are it were enough to put him to ill thinking who he i think the sun where he was born drew all such humors from him i will not leave him now till cassio be called to him how is 't with you my lord well my good lord it yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow you may indeed say so for 'twas that hand that gave away my heart i cannot speak of this come now your promise i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you here my lord i have it not about me no faith my lord is 't possible i' faith is 't true then would to god that i had never seen 't why do you speak so startingly and rash heaven bless us it is not lost but what an if it were i say it is not lost why so i can but i will not now this is a trick to put me from my suit pray you let cassio be received again come come you'll never meet a more sufficient man i pray talk me of cassio a man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love shared dangers with you  i' faith you are to blame i ne'er saw this before sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief i am most unhappy in the loss of it how now good cassio what's the news with you alas thrice gentle cassio my advocation is not now in tune my lord is not my lord nor should i know him were he in favor as in humor altered so help me every spirit sanctified as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech you must awhile be patient what i can do i will and more i will than for myself i dare let that suffice you i prithee do so something sure of state either from venice or some unhatched practice made demonstrable here in cyprus to him hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases men's natures wrangle with inferior things though great ones are their object 'tis even so for let our finger ache and it endues our other healthful members even to a sense of pain nay we must think men are not gods nor of them look for such observancy as fits the bridal beshrew me much emilia i was unhandsome warrior as i am  arraigning his unkindness with my soul but now i find i had suborned the witness and he's indicted falsely alas the day i never gave him cause heaven keep that monster from othello's mind i will go seek him cassio walk hereabout if i do find him fit i'll move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost and what's the news good cousin lodovico cousin there's fall'n between him and my lord an unkind breach but you shall make all well my lord a most unhappy one i would do much t' atone them for the love i bear to cassio my lord what is he angry by my troth i am glad on 't my lord why sweet othello i have not deserved this i will not stay to offend you my lord my lord what is your will what is your pleasure what horrible fancy's this upon my knees what doth your speech import i understand a fury in your words but not the words your wife my lord your true and loyal wife heaven doth truly know it to whom my lord with whom how am i false alas the heavy day why do you weep am i the motive of these tears my lord if haply you my father do suspect an instrument of this your calling back lay not your blame on me if you have lost him i have lost him too i hope my noble lord esteems me honest alas what ignorant sin have i committed by heaven you do me wrong no as i am a christian if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet i am none no as i shall be saved o heaven forgive us faith half asleep with who who is thy lord i have none do not talk to me emilia i cannot weep nor answers have i none but what should go by water prithee tonight lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember and call thy husband hither 'tis meet i should be used so very meet how have i been behaved that he might stick the small'st opinion on my least misuse i cannot tell those that do teach young babes do it with gentle means and easy tasks he might have chid me so for in good faith i am a child to chiding am i that name iago such as she said my lord did say i was i do not know i am sure i am none such it is my wretched fortune nay heaven doth know if any such there be heaven pardon him alas iago what shall i do to win my lord again good friend go to him for by this light of heaven i know not how i lost him here i kneel if e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love either in discourse of thought or actual deed or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense delighted them in any other form or that i do not yet and ever did and ever will though he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement love him dearly comfort forswear me unkindness may do much and his unkindness may defeat my life but never taint my love i cannot say whore  it does abhor me now i speak the word to do the act that might the addition earn not the world's mass of vanity could make me if 'twere no other  your honor is most welcome my lord i will my lord he says he will return incontinent and hath commanded me to go to bed and bade me to dismiss you it was his bidding therefore good emilia give me my nightly wearing and adieu we must not now displease him so would not i my love doth so approve him that even his stubbornness his checks his frowns  prithee unpin me have grace and favor in them all's one good faith how foolish are our minds if i do die before thee prithee shroud me in one of those same sheets my mother had a maid called barbary she was in love and he she loved proved mad and did forsake her she had a song of willow an old thing 'twas but it expressed her fortune and she died singing it that song tonight will not go from my mind i have much to do but to go hang my head all at one side and sing it like poor barbary prithee dispatch no unpin me here this lodovico is a proper man he speaks well the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree sing all a green willow her hand on her bosom her head on her knee sing willow willow willow the fresh streams ran by her and murmured her moans sing willow willow willow her salt tears fell from her and softened the stones  lay by these sing willow willow willow prithee hie thee he'll come anon sing all a green willow must be my garland let nobody blame him his scorn i approve nay that's not next hark who is 't that knocks i called my love false love but what said he then sing willow willow willow if i court more women you'll couch with more men  so get thee gone good night mine eyes do itch doth that bode weeping i have heard it said so o these men these men dost thou in conscience think tell me emilia  that there be women do

and ask him ay but not yet to die then lord have mercy on me and have you mercy too i never did offend you in my life never loved cassio but with such general warranty of heaven as i might love i never gave him token he found it then i never gave it him send for him hither let him confess a truth what my lord how unlawfully he will not say so o my fear interprets what is he dead alas he is

our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong and as the butcher takes away the calf and binds the wretch and beats it when it strains bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse even so remorseless have they borne him hence and as the dam runs lowing up and down looking the way her harmless young one went and can do naught but wail her darling's loss even so myself bewails good gloucester's case with sad unhelpful tears and with dimmed eyes look after him and cannot do him good so mighty are his vow\u00e8d enemies his fortunes i will weep and

now why look'st thou pale why tremblest thou where is our uncle what's the matter suffolk o heavenly god what doth my lord of suffolk comfort me came he right now to sing a raven's note whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers and thinks he that the chirping of a wren by crying comfort from a hollow breast can chase away the first conceiv\u00e8d sound hide not thy poison with such sugared words lay not thy hands on me forbear i say their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting thou baleful messenger out of my sight upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny sits in grim majesty to fright the world

upon his sudden death o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts my thoughts that labor to persuade my soul some violent hands were laid on humphrey's life if my suspect be false forgive me god for judgment only doth belong to thee fain would i go to chafe his paly lips with twenty thousand kisses and to drain upon his face an ocean of salt tears to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling but all in vain are these mean obsequies and to survey his dead and earthy image what were it but to make my sorrow greater that is to see how deep my grave is made for with his soul fled all my worldly solace for seeing him i see my life in death what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just and he but naked though locked up in steel whose conscience with injustice is corrupted why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn here in our presence dare you be so bold why what tumultuous clamor have we here go salisbury and tell them all from me i thank them for their tender loving care and had i not been cited so by them yet did i purpose as they do entreat for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy mischance

queen to call him gentle suffolk no more i say if thou dost plead for him thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath had i but said i would have kept my word but when i swear it is irrevocable if after

how fares my lord speak beaufort to thy sovereign ah what a sign it is of evil life where death's approach is seen so terrible o thou eternal mover of the heavens look with a gentle eye upon this

think'st on heaven's bliss hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope he dies and makes no sign o god forgive him forbear to judge for we are sinners all close up his eyes and draw the curtain close and let us all to meditation i'll send some holy bishop to entreat for god forbid so many simple souls should perish by the sword and i myself rather than bloody war shall cut them short will parley with jack cade their general but stay i'll read it over once again lord saye jack cade hath sworn to have thy head how now madam still lamenting and mourning for suffolk's death i fear me love if that i had been dead thou wouldst not have mourned so much for me how now what news why com'st thou in such haste o graceless men they know not what they do lord saye the traitors hateth thee therefore away with us to killingworth come margaret god our hope will succor us farewell my lord trust not the kentish rebels was ever king that joyed an earthly throne and could command no more content than i no sooner was i crept out of my cradle but i was made a king at nine months old was never subject longed to be a king as i do long and wish to be a subject why buckingham is the traitor cade surprised or

england curse my wretched reign buckingham doth york intend no harm to us that thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm then what intends these forces thou dost bring the head of cade great god how just art thou o let me view his visage being dead that living wrought me such exceeding trouble tell me my friend art thou the man that slew him how art thou called and what is thy degree iden kneel down rise up a knight we give thee for reward a thousand marks and will that thou henceforth attend on us see buckingham somerset comes with th' queen go bid her hide him quickly from the duke ay clifford a bedlam and ambitious humor makes him oppose himself against his king why warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow  old salisbury shame to thy silver hair thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son what wilt thou on thy deathbed play the ruffian and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles o where is faith o where is loyalty if it be banished from the frosty head where shall it find a harbor in the earth wilt

worthier the cardinal's not my better in the field warwick may live to be the best of all that can i witness and a fouler fact did never traitor in the land commit image of pride why should i hold my peace sweet york begin and if thy claim be good the nevilles are thy subjects to command father the duke hath told the truth thus got the house of lancaster the crown what plain proceedings is more plain than this henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt the fourth son york claims it from the third till lionel's issue fails his should not reign it fails not yet but flourishes in thee and in thy sons fair slips of such a stock then father salisbury kneel we together and in this private plot be we the first that shall salute our rightful sovereign with honor of his birthright to the crown long live our sovereign richard england's king my heart assures me that the earl of warwick shall one day make the duke of york a king it is reported mighty sovereign that good duke humphrey traitorously is murdered by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort's means the commons like an angry hive of bees that want their leader scatter up and down and care not who they sting in his revenge myself have calmed their spleenful mutiny until they hear the order of his death that shall i do my liege stay salisbury with the rude multitude till i return come hither gracious sovereign view this body as surely as my soul intends to live with that dread king that took our state upon him to free us from his father's wrathful curse i do believe that violent hands were laid upon the life of this thrice fam\u00e8d duke see how the blood is settled in his face oft have i seen a timely parted ghost of ashy semblance meager pale and bloodless being all descended to the laboring heart who in the conflict that it holds with death attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth to blush and beautify the cheek again but see his face is black and full of blood his eyeballs further out than when he lived staring full ghastly like a strangled man his hair upreared his nostrils stretched with struggling his hands abroad displayed as one that grasped and tugged for life and was by strength subdued look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking his well proportioned beard made rough and rugged like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged it cannot be but he was murdered here the least of all these signs were probable but both of you were vowed duke humphrey's foes and you forsooth had the good duke to keep 'tis like you would not feast him like a friend and 'tis well seen he found an enemy who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh and sees fast by a butcher with an ax but will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest but may imagine how the bird was dead although the kite soar with unbloodied beak even so suspicious is this tragedy what dares not warwick if false suffolk dare him madam be still with reverence may i say  for every word you speak in his behalf is slander to your royal dignity but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee and i should rob the deathsman of his fee quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames and that my sovereign's presence makes me mild i would false murd'rous coward on thy knee make thee beg pardon for thy pass\u00e8d speech and say it was thy mother that thou meant'st that thou thyself wast born in bastardy and after all this fearful homage done give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men away even now or i will drag thee hence unworthy though thou art i'll cope with thee and do some service to duke humphrey's ghost beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee see how the pangs of death

sir your presence is too bold and peremptory and majesty might never yet endure the moody frontier of a servant brow you have good leave to leave us when we need your use and counsel we shall send for you you were about to speak why yet he doth deny his prisoners but with proviso and exception that we at our own charge shall ransom straight his brother in law the foolish mortimer who on my soul hath willfully betrayed the lives of those that he did lead to fight against that great magician damned glendower whose daughter as we hear that earl of march hath lately married shall our coffers then be emptied to redeem a traitor home shall we buy treason and indent with fears when they have lost and forfeited themselves no on the barren mountains let him starve for i shall never hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him he never did encounter with glendower i tell thee he durst as well have met the devil alone as owen glendower for an enemy art thou not ashamed but sirrah henceforth let me not hear you speak of mortimer send me your prisoners with the speediest means or you shall hear in such a kind from me as will displease you my lord northumberland we license your departure with your son  send us your prisoners or you will hear of it lords give us leave the prince of wales and i must have some private conference but be near at hand for we shall presently have need of you i know not whether god will have it so for some displeasing service i have done that in his secret doom out of my blood he'll breed revengement and a scourge for me but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only marked for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings tell me else could such inordinate and low desires such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts such barren pleasures rude society as thou art matched withal and grafted to accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry at thy affections which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors thy place in council thou hast rudely lost which by thy younger brother is supplied and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectation of thy time is ruined and the soul of every man prophetically do forethink thy fall had i so lavish of my presence been so common hackneyed in the eyes of men so stale and cheap to vulgar company opinion that did help me to the crown had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment a fellow of no mark nor likelihood by being seldom seen i could not stir but like a comet i was wondered at that men would tell their children this is he others would say where which is bolingbroke and then i stole all courtesy from heaven and dressed myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from men's hearts loud shouts and salutations from their mouths even in the presence of the crown\u00e8d king thus did i keep my person fresh and new my presence like a robe pontifical ne'er seen but wondered at and so my state seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity the skipping king he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state mingled his royalty with cap'ring fools had his great name profan\u00e8d with their scorns and gave his countenance against his name to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative grew a companion to the common streets enfeoffed himself to popularity that being daily swallowed by men's eyes they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little more than a little is by much too much so when he had occasion to be seen he was but as the cuckoo is in june heard not regarded seen but with such eyes as sick and blunted with community afford no extraordinary gaze such as is bent on sunlike majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes but rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down slept in his face and rendered such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries being with his presence glutted gorged and full and in that very line harry standest thou for thou hast lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is aweary of thy common sight save mine which hath desired to see thee more which now doth that i would not have it do make blind itself with foolish tenderness for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh and even as i was then is percy now now by my scepter and my soul to boot he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession for of no right nor color like to right he doth fill fields with harness in the realm turns head against the lion's arm\u00e8d jaws and being no more in debt to years than thou leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms what never dying honor hath he got against renown\u00e8d douglas whose high deeds whose hot incursions and great name in arms holds from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ thrice hath this hotspur mars in swaddling clothes this infant warrior in his enterprises discomfited great douglas ta'en him once enlarg\u00e8d him and made a friend of him to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne and what say you to this percy northumberland the archbishop's grace of york douglas mortimer capitulate against us and are up but wherefore do i tell these news to thee why harry do i tell thee of my foes which art my nearest and dearest enemy thou that art like enough through vassal fear base inclination and the start of spleen to fight against me under percy's pay

abhorr\u00e8d war and move in that obedient orb again where you did give a fair and natural light and be no more an exhaled meteor a prodigy of fear and a portent of broach\u00e8d mischief to the unborn times you have not sought it how comes it then these things indeed you have articulate proclaimed at market crosses read in churches to face the garment of rebellion with some fine color that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation and never yet did insurrection want such water colors to impaint his cause nor moody beggars starving for a time of pellmell havoc and confusion and prince of wales so dare we venture thee albeit considerations infinite do make against it no good worcester no we love

too much lord john of lancaster go you with him i will do so my lord of westmoreland lead him to his tent i saw him hold lord percy at the point with lustier maintenance than i did look for of such an ungrown warrior the king himself who douglas grieves at heart so many of his shadows thou hast met and not the very king i have two boys seek percy and thyself about the field but seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily i will assay thee and defend thyself stay and breathe awhile thou hast redeemed thy lost opinion and showed thou mak'st some tender of my life in this fair rescue thou hast brought to

the court may echo with the noise sons let it be your charge as it is ours to attend the emperor's person carefully i have been troubled in my sleep this night but dawning day new comfort hath inspired many good morrows to your majesty  madam to you as many and as good  i promis\u00e8d your grace a hunter's peal and i have horse will follow where the game makes way and runs like swallows o'er the plain high emperor upon my feeble knee i beg this boon with tears not lightly shed that this fell fault of my accurs\u00e8d sons  accurs\u00e8d if the faults be proved in them  i did my lord yet let me be their bail for by my father's reverend tomb i vow they shall be ready at your highness' will to answer their suspicion with their lives come lucius come stay not to talk with them hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay for pity of mine age whose youth was spent in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept for all my blood in rome's great quarrel shed for all the frosty nights that i have watched and for these bitter tears which now you see filling the ag\u00e8d wrinkles in my cheeks be pitiful to my condemn\u00e8d sons whose souls is not corrupted as 'tis thought for two and twenty sons i never wept because they died in honor's lofty bed for these tribunes in the dust i write my heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite my sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush o earth i will befriend thee more with rain that shall distil from these two ancient ruins than youthful april shall with all his showers in summer's drought i'll drop upon thee still in winter with warm tears i'll melt the snow and keep eternal springtime on thy face so thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood o reverend tribunes o gentle ag\u00e8d men unbind my sons reverse the doom of death and let me say that never wept before my tears are now prevailing orators ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead  grave tribunes once more i entreat of you  why 'tis no matter man if they did hear they would not mark me if they did mark they would not pity me yet plead i must and bootless unto them therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones who though they cannot answer my distress yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes for that they will not intercept my tale when i do weep they humbly at my feet receive my tears and seem to weep with me and were they but attir\u00e8d in grave weeds rome could afford no tribunes like to these a stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones a stone is silent and offendeth not and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death but wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn o happy man they have befriended thee why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive that rome is but a wilderness of tigers tigers must prey and rome affords no prey but me and mine how happy art thou then from these devourers to be banish\u00e8d but who comes with our brother marcus here will it consume me let me see it then why marcus so she is faint hearted boy arise and look upon her  speak lavinia what accurs\u00e8d hand hath made thee handless in thy father's sight what fool hath added water to the sea or brought a faggot to bright burning troy my grief was at the height before thou cam'st and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds  give me a sword i'll chop off my hands too for they have fought for rome and all in vain and they have nursed this woe in feeding life in bootless prayer have they been held up and they have served me to effectless use now all the service i require of them is that the one will help to cut the other  'tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands for hands to do rome service is but vain it was my dear and he that wounded her hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead for now i stand as one upon a rock environed with a wilderness of sea who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave expecting ever when some envious surge will in his brinish bowels swallow him this way to death my wretched sons are gone here stands my other son a banished man and here my brother weeping at my woes but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn is dear lavinia dearer than my soul had i but seen thy picture in this plight it would have madded me what shall i do now i behold thy lively body so thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears nor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee thy husband he is dead and for his death thy brothers are condemned and dead by this  look marcus ah son lucius look on her when i did name her brothers then fresh tears stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew upon a gathered lily almost withered if they did kill thy husband then be joyful because the law hath ta'en revenge on them  no no they would not do so foul a deed witness the sorrow that their sister makes  gentle lavinia let me kiss thy lips or make some sign how i may do thee ease shall thy good uncle and thy brother lucius and thou and i sit round about some fountain looking all downwards to behold our cheeks how they are stained like meadows yet not dry with miry slime left on them by a flood and in the fountain shall we gaze so long till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness and made a brine pit with our bitter tears or shall we cut away our hands like thine or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows pass the remainder of our hateful days what shall we do let us that have our tongues plot some device of further misery to make us wondered at in time to come ah marcus marcus brother well i wot thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine for thou poor man hast drowned it with thine own mark marcus mark i understand her signs had she a tongue to speak now would she say that to her brother which i said to thee his napkin with his true tears all bewet can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks o what a sympathy of woe is this as far from help as limbo is from bliss o gracious emperor o gentle aaron did ever raven sing so like a lark that gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise with all my heart i'll send the emperor my hand good aaron wilt thou help to chop it off sirs strive no more such withered herbs as these are meet for plucking up and therefore mine agree between you i will spare my hand come hither aaron i'll deceive them both lend me thy hand and i will give thee mine now stay your strife what shall be is dispatched  good aaron give his majesty my hand tell him it was a hand that warded him from thousand dangers bid him bury it more hath it merited that let it have as for my sons say i account of them as jewels purchased at an easy price and yet dear too because i bought mine own o here i lift this one hand up to heaven and bow this feeble ruin to the earth if any power pities wretched tears to that i call what wouldst thou kneel with me do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim and stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds when they do hug him in their melting bosoms is not my sorrow deep having no bottom then be my passions bottomless with them if there were reason for these miseries then into limits could i bind my woes when heaven doth weep doth not the earth o'erflow if the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad threat'ning the welkin with his big swoll'n face and wilt thou have a reason for this coil i am the sea hark how her sighs doth flow she is the weeping welkin i the earth then must my sea be mov\u00e8d with her sighs then must my earth with her continual tears become a deluge overflowed and drowned forwhy my bowels cannot hide her woes but like a drunkard must i vomit them then give me leave for losers will have leave to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues when will this fearful slumber have an end ha ha ha why i have not another tear to shed besides this sorrow is an enemy and would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes and make them blind with tributary tears then which way shall i find revenge's cave for these two heads do seem to speak to me and threat me i shall never come to bliss till all these mischiefs be returned again even in their throats that hath committed them come let me see what task i have to do you heavy people circle me about that i may turn me to each one of you and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs the vow is made come brother take a head and in this hand the other will i bear  and lavinia thou shalt be employed in these arms bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth  as for thee boy go get thee from my sight thou art an exile and thou must not stay hie to the goths and raise an army there and if you love me as i think you do let's kiss and part for we have much to do so so now sit and look you eat no more than will preserve just so much strength in us as will revenge these bitter woes of ours marcus unknit that sorrow wreathen knot thy niece and i poor creatures want our hands and cannot passionate our tenfold grief with folded arms this poor right hand of mine is left to tyrannize upon my breast who when my heart all mad with misery beats in this hollow prison of my flesh then thus i thump it down  thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating thou canst not strike it thus to make it still wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans or get some little knife between thy teeth and just against thy heart make thou a hole that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall may run into that sink and soaking in drown the lamenting fool in sea salt tears how now has sorrow made thee dote already why marcus no man should be mad but i what violent hands can she lay on her life ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands to bid aeneas tell the tale twice o'er how troy was burnt and he made miserable o handle not the theme to talk of hands lest we remember still that we have none  fie fie how franticly i square my talk as if we should forget we had no hands if marcus did not name the word of hands come let's fall to and gentle girl eat this here is no drink hark marcus what she says i can interpret all her martyred signs she says she drinks no other drink but tears brewed with her sorrow mashed upon her cheeks  speechless complainer i will learn thy thought in thy dumb action will i be as perfect as begging hermits in their holy prayers thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign but i of these will wrest an alphabet and by still practice learn to know thy meaning peace tender sapling thou art made of tears and tears will quickly melt thy life away what dost thou strike at marcus with thy knife out on thee murderer thou kill'st my heart mine eyes are cloyed with view of tyranny a deed of death done on the innocent becomes not titus' brother get thee gone i see thou art not for my company but how if that fly had a father and mother how would he hang his slender gilded wings and buzz lamenting doings in the air poor harmless fly that with his pretty buzzing melody came here to make us merry and thou hast killed him o o o then pardon me for reprehending thee for thou hast done a charitable deed give me thy knife i will insult on him flattering myself as if it were the moor come hither purposely to poison me there's for thyself and that's for tamora ah sirrah yet i think we are not brought so low but that between us we can kill a fly that comes in likeness of a coal black moor come take away lavinia go with me i'll to thy closet and go read with thee sad stories chanc\u00e8d in the times of old

knowledge of his chin nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and true maid orlando alas the day what shall i do with my doublet and hose what did he when thou saw'st him what said he how looked he wherein went he what makes he here did he ask for me where remains he how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see him again answer me in one word but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man's apparel looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled it may well be called jove's tree when it drops forth such fruit proceed though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground o ominous he comes to kill my heart do you not know i am a woman when i think i must speak sweet say on 'tis he slink by and note him i will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him do you hear forester i pray you what is 't o'clock then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock by no means sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons i'll tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a se'nnight time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal there were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that fancy monger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him there is none of my uncle's marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation but you are no such man you are rather point device in your accouterments as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other me believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his love his mistress and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this color would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart that there shall not be one spot of love in 't i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me go with me to it and i'll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live will you go nay you must call me rosalind come sister will you go never talk to me i will weep but have i not cause to weep his very hair is of the dissembling color i' faith his hair is of a good color and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not do you think so not true in love you have heard him swear downright he was i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him he asked me of what parentage i was i told him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando o come let us remove the sight of lovers feedeth those in love bring us to this sight and you shall say i'll prove a busy actor in their play and why i pray you who might be your mother that you insult exult and all at once over the wretched what though you have no beauty  as by my faith i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed  must you be therefore proud and pitiless why what means this why do you look on me i see no more in you than in the ordinary of nature's sale work 'od's my little life i think she means to tangle my eyes too  no faith proud mistress hope not after it 'tis not your inky brows your black silk hair your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream that can entame my spirits to your worship  you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her like foggy south puffing with wind and rain you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman 'tis such fools as you that makes the world full of ill favored children 'tis not her glass but you that flatters her and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her  but mistress know yourself down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good man's love for i must tell you friendly in your ear sell when you can you are not for all markets cry the man mercy love him take his offer foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer  so take her to thee shepherd fare you well he's fall'n in love with your foulness and she'll fall in love with my anger if it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks i'll sauce her with bitter words why look you so upon me i pray you do not fall in love with me for i am falser than vows made in wine besides i like you not if you will know my house 'tis at the tuft of olives here hard by  will you go sister shepherd ply her hard  come sister shepherdess look on him better and be not proud though all the world could see none could be so abused in sight as he  come to our flock they say you are a melancholy fellow those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards why then 'tis good to be a post a traveller by my faith you have great reason to be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide god for making you that countenance you are or i will scarce think you have swam in a gondola why how now orlando where have you been all this while you a lover an you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more break an hour's promise in love he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid hath clapped him o' th' shoulder but i'll warrant him heart whole nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight i had as lief be wooed of a snail ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head a better jointure i think than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with him why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife and i am your rosalind come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday humor and like enough to consent what would you say to me now an i were your very very rosalind nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking god warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter marry that should you if i were your mistress or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit am not i your rosalind well in her person i say i will not have you no faith die by attorney the poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a love cause troilus had his brains dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love leander he would have lived many a fair year though hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was hero of sestos but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now i will be your rosalind in a more coming on disposition and ask me what you will i will grant it yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all ay and twenty such are you not good why then can one desire too much of a good thing come sister you shall be the priest and marry us give me your hand orlando what do you say sister you must begin will you orlando  ay but when then you must say i take thee rosalind for wife i might ask you for your commission but i do take thee orlando for my husband there's a girl goes before the priest and certainly a woman's thought runs before her actions now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her say a day without the ever no no orlando men are april when they woo december when they wed maids are may when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock pigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyena and that when thou art inclined to sleep by my life she will do as i do or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a woman's wit and it will out at the casement shut that and 'twill out at the keyhole stop that 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbor's bed marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue o that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and i thought no less that flattering tongue of yours won me 'tis but one cast away and so come death two o'clock is your hour by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour i will think you the most pathetical break promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep your promise well time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try adieu o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love but it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of portugal no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone's eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep i am in love i'll tell thee aliena i cannot be out of the sight of orlando i'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come how say you now is it not past two o'clock and here much orlando patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer bear this bear all she says i am not fair that i lack manners she calls me proud and that she could not love me were man as rare as phoenix 'od's my will her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me well shepherd well this is a letter of your own device come come you are a fool and turned into the extremity of love i saw her hand she has a leathern hand a freestone colored hand i verily did think that her old gloves were on but 'twas her hands she has a huswife's hand but that's no matter i say she never did invent this letter this is a man's invention and his hand why 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style a style for challengers why she defies me like turk to christian women's gentle brain could not drop forth such giant rude invention such ethiop words blacker in their effect than in their countenance will you hear the letter she phoebes me mark how the tyrant writes art thou god to shepherd turned that a maiden's heart hath burned can a woman rail thus why thy godhead laid apart warr'st thou with a woman's heart did you ever hear such railing whiles the eye of man did woo me that could do no vengeance to me meaning me a beast if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine alack in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect whiles you chid me i did love how then might your prayers move he that brings this love to thee little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make or else by him my love deny and then i'll study how to die do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt thou love such a woman what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee not to be endured well go your way to her for i see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her that if she love me i charge her to love thee if she will not i will never have her unless thou entreat for her if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company i am what must we understand by this but to orlando did he leave him there food to the sucked and hungry lioness was 't you he rescued but for the bloody napkin i would i were at home i do so i confess it ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited i pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited heigh ho counterfeit i assure you so i do but i' faith i should have been a woman by right i shall devise something but i pray you commend my counterfeiting to him will you go god save you brother o my dear orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkercher o i know where you are nay 'tis true there was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesar's thrasonical brag of i came saw and overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked no sooner looked but they loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage they are in the very wrath of love and they will together clubs cannot part them why then tomorrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind i will weary you then no longer with idle talking know of me then for now i speak to some purpose that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch i say i know you are neither do i labor for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me believe then if you please that i can do strange things i have since i was three year old conversed with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her i know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger by my life i do which i tender dearly though i say i am a magician therefore put you in your best array bid your friends for if you will be married tomorrow you shall and to rosalind if you will look here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers i care not if i have it is my study to seem despiteful and ungentle to you you are there followed by a faithful shepherd look upon him love him he worships you and i for no woman and i for no woman and so am i for no woman why do you speak too why blame you me to love you pray you no more of this 'tis like the howling of irish wolves against the moon i will help you if i can i would love you if i could tomorrow meet me all together i will marry you if ever i marry woman and i'll be married tomorrow i will satisfy you if ever i satisfy man and you shall be married tomorrow i will content you if what pleases you contents you and you shall be married tomorrow as you love rosalind meet as you love phoebe meet and as i love no woman i'll meet so fare you well i have left you commands patience once more whiles our compact is urged you say if i bring in your rosalind you will bestow her on orlando here and you say you will have her when i bring her you say you'll marry me if i be willing but if you do refuse to marry me you'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd you say that you'll have phoebe if she will i have promised to make all this matter even keep you your word o duke to give your daughter  you yours orlando to receive his daughter  keep you your word phoebe that you'll marry me or else refusing me to wed this shepherd  keep your word silvius that you'll marry her if she refuse me and from hence i go to make these doubts all even to you i give myself for i am yours to you i give myself for i am yours i'll have no father if you be not he i'll have no husband if you be not he nor ne'er wed woman if you be not she it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue if it be true that good wine needs no bush 'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues what a case am i in then that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play i am not furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me my way is to conjure you and i'll begin with the women i charge you o women for the love you bear to men to like as much of this play as please you and i charge you o men for the love you bear to women as i perceive by your simpering none of you hates them that between you and the women the play may please if i were a woman i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me complexions that liked me and breaths that i defied not and i am sure as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when i make curtsy bid me farewell", "Lr_Regan": "i am made of that self mettle as my sister and prize me at her worth in my true

soul and there scatters dangers doubts wringing of the conscience fears and despairs and all these for his marriage and out of all these to restore the king he counsels a divorce a loss of her that like a jewel has hung twenty years about his neck yet never lost her luster of her that loves him with that excellence that angels love good men with even of her that when the greatest stroke of fortune falls will bless the king and is not this course pious we had need pray and heartily for our deliverance or this imperious man will work us all from princes into pages all men's honors lie

himself it's heaven's will some spirit put this paper in the packet to bless your eye withal hear the king's pleasure cardinal who commands you to render up the great seal presently into our hands and to confine yourself to asher house my lord of winchester's till you hear further from his highness those articles my lord are in the king's hand but thus much they are foul ones then that in all you writ to rome or else to foreign princes ego et rex meus was still inscribed in which you brought the king to be your servant and so we'll leave you to your meditations how to live better for your stubborn answer about the giving back the great seal to us the king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you so fare you well my little good lord cardinal who waits there we are do you think my lords the king will suffer but the little finger of this man to be vexed", "H8_GENTLEMEN.1": "whither away so fast i'll save you that labor sir all's now done but the ceremony of bringing back the prisoner yes indeed was i you may guess quickly what yes truly is he and condemned upon 't so are a number more i'll tell you in a little the great duke came to the bar where to his accusations he pleaded still not guilty and alleged many sharp reasons to defeat the law the king's attorney on the contrary urged on the examinations proofs confessions of divers witnesses which the duke desired to him brought viva voce to his face at which appeared against him his surveyor sir gilbert peck his chancellor and john car confessor to him with that devil monk hopkins that made this mischief the same all these accused him strongly which he fain would have flung from him but indeed he could not and so his peers upon this evidence have found him guilty of high treason much he spoke and learn\u00e8dly for life but all was either pitied in him or forgotten when he was brought again to th' bar to hear his knell rung out his judgment he was stirred with such an agony he sweat extremely and something spoke in choler ill and hasty but he fell to himself again and sweetly in all the rest showed a most noble patience sure he does not he never was so womanish the cause he may a little grieve at 'tis likely by all conjectures first kildare's attainder then deputy of ireland who removed earl surrey was sent thither and in haste too lest he should help his father at his return no doubt he will requite it this is noted and generally whoever the king favors the card'nal instantly will find employment and far enough from court too stay there sir and see the noble ruined man you speak of o this is full of pity sir it calls i fear too many curses on their heads that were the authors good angels keep it from us what may it be you do not doubt my faith sir let me have it i do not talk much yes but it held not for when the king once heard it out of anger he sent command to the lord mayor straight to stop the rumor and allay those tongues that durst disperse it 'tis the cardinal and merely to revenge him on the emperor for not bestowing on him at his asking the archbishopric of toledo this is purposed 'tis woeful we are too open here to argue this let's think in private more you're well met once again you come to take your stand here and behold the lady anne pass from her coronation 'tis very true but that time offered sorrow this general joy never greater nor i'll assure you better taken sir yes 'tis the list of those that claim their offices this day by custom of the coronation the duke of suffolk is the first and claims to be high steward next the duke of norfolk he to be earl marshal you may read the rest that i can tell you too the archbishop of canterbury accompanied with other learn\u00e8d and reverend fathers of his order held a late court at dunstable six miles off from ampthill where the princess lay to which she was often cited by them but appeared not and to be short for not appearance and the king's late scruple by the main assent of all these learn\u00e8d men she was divorced and the late marriage made of none effect since which she was removed to kymmalton where she remains now sick marques dorset and that the earl of surrey with the rod 'tis the same high steward yes they that bear the cloth of honor over her are four barons of the cinque ports it is and all the rest are countesses and sometimes falling ones god save you sir where have you been broiling how was it sir you must no more call it york place that's past for since the cardinal fell that title's lost 'tis now the king's and called whitehall you may command us sir", "Ado_Beatrice": "i pray you is signior mountanto returned from the wars or no he set up his bills here in messina and challenged cupid at the flight and my uncle's fool reading the challenge subscribed for cupid and challenged him at the bird bolt i pray you how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars but how many hath he killed for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffing well we are all mortal alas he gets nothing by that in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature who is his companion now he hath every month a new sworn brother very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block no an he were i would burn my study but i pray you who is his companion is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad god help the noble claudio if he have caught the benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured do good friend no not till a hot january i wonder that you will still be talking signior benedick nobody marks you is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as signior benedick courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor i thank god and my cold blood i am of your humor for that i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me scratching could not make it worse an 'twere such a face as yours were a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours you always end with a jade's trick i know you of old how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see him but i am heartburned an hour after he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my lady's eldest son evermore tattling with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if he could get her goodwill too curst is more than curst i shall lessen god's sending that way for it is said god sends a curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none just if he send me no husband for the which blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and evening lord i could not endure a husband with a beard on his face i had rather lie in the woolen what should i do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man i am not for him therefore i will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd and lead his apes into hell no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say get you to heaven beatrice get you to heaven here's no place for you maids so deliver i up my apes and away to saint peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long yes faith it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy and say father as it please you but yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another curtsy and say father as it please me not till god make men of some other metal than earth would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl no uncle i'll none adam's sons are my brethren and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is measure in everything and so dance out the answer for hear me hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig a measure and a cinquepace the first suit is hot and hasty like a scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerly modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight will you not tell me who told you so nor will you not tell me who you are that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of the hundred merry tales well this was signior benedick that said so i am sure you know him well enough did he never make you laugh why he is the prince's jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villainy for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in the fleeti would he had boarded me do do he'll but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then there's a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night we must follow the leaders nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at the next turning indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave him use for it a double heart for his single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well

man deserve of me that would right her a very even way but no such friend it is a man's office but not yours as strange as the thing i know not it were as possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as you but believe me not and yet i lie not i confess nothing nor i deny nothing i am sorry for my cousin do not swear and eat it will you not eat your word why then god forgive me you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to protest i loved you i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest kill claudio you kill me to deny it farewell i am gone though i am here there is no love in you nay i pray you let me go in faith i will go you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonored my kinswoman o that i were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancor o god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the marketplace talk with a man out at a window a proper saying sweet hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone princes and counties surely a princely testimony a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into curtsies valor into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears it i cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving use it for my love some other way than swearing by it yea as sure as i have a thought or a soul yea signior and depart when you bid me then is spoken fare you well now and yet ere i go let me go with that i came which is with knowing what hath passed between you and claudio foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore i will depart unkissed for them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me in spite of your heart i think alas poor heart if you spite it for my sake i will spite it for yours for i will never love that which my friend hates it appears not in this confession there's not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself and how long is that think you very ill very ill too will you go hear this news signior i answer to that name what is your will why no no more than reason do not you love me why then my cousin margaret and ursula are much deceived for they did swear you did they swore that you were well nigh dead for me no truly but in friendly recompense i would not deny you but by this

time when tempest of commotion like the south borne with black vapor doth begin to melt and drop upon our bare unarm\u00e8d heads  give me my sword and cloak falstaff good night who saw the duke of clarence how now rain within doors and none abroad how doth the king heard he the good news yet tell it him if he be sick with joy he'll recover without physic no i will sit and watch here by the king why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow being so troublesome a bedfellow o polished perturbation golden care that keep'st the ports of slumber open wide to many a watchful night sleep with it now yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet as he whose brow with homely biggen bound snores out the watch of night o majesty when thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit like a rich armor worn in heat of day that scald'st with safety by his gates of breath there lies a downy feather which stirs not did he suspire that light and weightless down perforce must move my gracious lord my father this sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep that from this golden rigol hath divorced so many english kings thy due from me is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood which nature love and filial tenderness shall o dear father pay thee plenteously my due from thee is this imperial crown which as immediate from thy place and blood derives itself to me lo where it sits which god shall guard and put the world's whole strength into one giant arm it shall not force this lineal honor from me this from thee will i to mine leave as 'tis left to me i never thought to hear you speak again o pardon me my liege but for my tears the moist impediments unto my speech i had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard the course of it so far there is your crown and he that wears the crown immortally long guard it yours if i affect it more than as your honor and as your renown let me no more from this obedience rise which my most inward true and duteous spirit teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending god witness with me when i here came in and found no course of breath within your majesty how cold it struck my heart if i do feign o let me in my present wildness die and never live to show th' incredulous world the noble change that i have purpos\u00e8d coming to look on you thinking you dead and dead almost my liege to think you were i spake unto this crown as having sense and thus upbraided it the care on thee depending hath fed upon the body of my father therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold other less fine in carat is more precious preserving life in med'cine potable but thou most fine most honored most renowned hast eat thy bearer up thus my most royal liege accusing it i put it on my head to try with it as with an enemy that had before my face murdered my father the quarrel of a true inheritor but if it did infect my blood with joy or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride if any rebel or vain spirit of mine did with the least affection of a welcome give entertainment to the might of it let god forever keep it from my head and make me as the poorest vassal is that doth with awe and terror kneel to it my gracious liege you won it wore it kept it gave it me then plain and right must my possession be which i with more than with a common pain 'gainst all the world will rightfully maintain my lord of warwick this new and gorgeous garment majesty sits not so easy on me as you think  brothers you mix your sadness with some fear this is the english not the turkish court not amurath an amurath succeeds but harry harry yet be sad good brothers for by my faith it very well becomes you sorrow so royally in you appears that i will deeply put the fashion on and wear it in my heart why then be sad but entertain no more of it good brothers than a joint burden laid upon us all for me by heaven i bid you be assured i'll be your father and your brother too let me but bear your love i'll bear your cares yet weep that harry's dead and so will i but harry lives that shall convert those tears by number into hours of happiness you all look strangely on me and you most you are i think assured i love you not no how might a prince of my great hopes forget so great indignities you laid upon me what rate rebuke and roughly send to prison th' immediate heir of england was this easy may this be washed in lethe and forgotten you are right justice and you weigh this well therefore still bear the balance and the sword and i do wish your honors may increase till you do live to see a son of mine offend you and obey you as i did so shall i live to speak my father's words happy am i that have a man so bold that dares do justice on my proper son and not less happy having such a son that would deliver up his greatness so into the hands of justice you did commit me for which i do commit into your hand th' unstain\u00e8d sword that you have used to bear with this remembrance that you use the same with the like bold just and impartial spirit as you have done 'gainst me there is my hand you shall be as a father to my youth my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear and i will stoop and humble my intents to your well practiced wise directions  and princes all believe me i beseech you my father is gone wild into his grave for in his tomb lie my affections and with his spirits sadly i survive to mock the expectation of the world to frustrate prophecies and to raze out rotten opinion who hath writ me down after my seeming the tide of blood in me hath proudly flowed in vanity till now now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea where it shall mingle with the state of floods and flow henceforth in formal majesty now call we our high court of parliament and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel that the great body of our state may go in equal rank with the best governed nation that war or peace or both at once may be as things acquainted and familiar to us in which you father shall have foremost hand our coronation done we will accite as i before remembered all our state and god consigning to my good intents no prince nor peer shall have just cause to say god shorten harry's happy life one day my lord chief justice speak to that vain man i know thee not old man fall to thy prayers how ill white hairs becomes a fool and jester i have long dreamt of such a kind of man so

company when thou dost hear i am as i have been approach me and thou shalt be as thou wast the tutor and the feeder of my riots till then i banish thee on pain of death as i have done the rest of my misleaders not to come near our person by ten mile for competence of life i will allow you that lack of means enforce you not to evils and as we hear you do reform yourselves we will according to your

lady you have a merry heart lady beatrice i will get you one will you have me lady your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes you for out o' question you were born in a merry hour by my troth a pleasant spirited lady she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband she were an excellent wife for benedick county claudio when mean you to go to church come you shake the head at so long a breathing but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go dully by us i will in the interim undertake one of hercules' labors which is to bring signior benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of affection th' one with th' other i would fain have it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as i shall give you direction and you too gentle hero and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that i know thus far can i praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valor and confirmed honesty i will teach you how to humor your cousin that she shall fall in love with benedick  and i with your two helps will so practice on benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with beatrice if we can do this cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for we are the only love gods go in with me and i will tell you my drift come shall we hear this music see you where benedick hath hid himself come

thou hear balthasar i pray thee get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we would have it at the lady hero's chamber window do so farewell come hither leonato what was it you told me of today that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick maybe she doth but counterfeit why what effects of passion shows she how how i pray you you amaze me i would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection hath she made her affection known to benedick it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it an he should it were an alms to hang him she's an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous in everything but in loving benedick i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what he will say she doth well if she should make tender of her love 'tis very possible he'll scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit he hath indeed a good outward happiness he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most christianlike fear and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while i love benedick well and i could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another's dotage and no such matter that's the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumb show let us send her to call him in to dinner i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go i toward aragon nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupid's bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks hang him truant there's no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love if he be sad he wants money draw it what sigh for the toothache there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a dutchman today a frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a german from the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is hath any man seen him at the barber's nay he rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that the greatest note of it is his melancholy yea or to paint himself for the which i hear what they say of him indeed that tells a heavy tale for him conclude conclude he is in love that would i know too i warrant one that knows him not she shall be buried with her face upwards for my life to break with him about beatrice good e'en brother in private what's the matter you know he does why what's the matter i will not think it and as i wooed for thee to obtain her i will join with thee to disgrace her o day untowardly turned nothing unless you render her again what should i speak i stand dishonored that have gone about to link my dear friend to a common stale why then are you no maiden leonato i am sorry you must hear upon mine honor myself my brother and this griev\u00e8d count did see her hear her at that hour last night talk with a ruffian at her chamber window who hath indeed most like a liberal villain confessed the vile encounters they have had a thousand times in secret good e'en good e'en we have some haste leonato nay do not quarrel with us good old man you say not right old man gentlemen both we will not wake your patience my heart is sorry for your daughter's death but on my honor she was charged with nothing but what was true and very full of proof i will not hear you see see here comes the man we went to seek welcome signior you are almost come to part almost a fray leonato and his brother what think'st thou had we fought i doubt we should have been too young for them dost thou wear thy wit by thy side as i am an honest man he looks pale art thou sick or angry by this light he changes more and more i think he be angry indeed what a feast a feast i'll tell thee how beatrice praised thy wit the other day i said thou hadst a fine wit true said she a fine little one no said i a great wit right says she a great gross one nay said i a good wit just said she it hurts nobody nay said i the gentleman is wise certain said she a wise gentleman nay said i he hath the tongues that i believe said she for he swore a thing to me on monday night which he forswore on tuesday morning there's a double tongue there's two tongues thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues yet at last she concluded with a sigh thou wast the proper'st man in italy yea that she did but yet for all that an if she did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly the old man's daughter told us all but when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible benedick's head he is in earnest and hath challenged thee what a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit but soft you let me be pluck up my heart and be sad did he not say my brother was fled how now two of my brother's men bound borachio one officers what offense have these men done first i ask thee what they have done thirdly i ask thee what's their offense sixth and lastly why they are committed and to conclude what you lay to their charge who have you offended masters that you are thus bound to your answer this learned constable is too cunning to be understood what's your offense runs not this speech like iron through your blood but did my brother set thee on to this he is composed and framed of treachery and fled he is upon this villainy by my soul nor i and yet to satisfy this good old man i would bend under any heavy weight that he'll enjoin me to we will not fail good morrow masters put your torches out the wolves have preyed and look the gentle day before the wheels of phoebus round about dapples the drowsy east with spots of gray thanks to you all and leave us fare you well come let us hence and put on other weeds and then to leonato's we will go good morrow to this fair assembly good morrow benedick why what's the matter that you have such a february face so full of frost of

heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse and all my powers do their bestowing lose like vassalage at unawares encount'ring the eye of majesty you have bereft me of all words lady o cressid how often have i wished me thus what should they grant what makes this pretty abruption what too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love fears make devils of cherubins they never see truly o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupid's pageant there is presented no monster nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confined that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit are there such such are not we praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present we will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble few words to fair faith troilus shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer than troilus you know now your hostages your uncle's word and my firm faith why was my cressid then so hard to win and shall albeit sweet music issues thence your leave sweet cressid what offends you lady you cannot shun yourself well know they what they speak that speak so wisely o that i thought it could be in a woman  as if it can i will presume in you  to feed for aye her lamp and flames of love to keep her constancy in plight and youth outliving beauty's outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays or that persuasion could but thus convince me that my integrity and truth to you might be affronted with the match and weight of such a winnowed purity in love how were i then uplifted but alas i am as true as truth's simplicity and simpler than the infancy of truth o virtuous fight when right with right wars who shall be most right true swains in love shall in the world to come approve their truth by troilus when their rhymes full of protest of oath and big compare wants similes truth tired with iteration  as true as steel as plantage to the moon as sun to day as turtle to her mate as iron to adamant as earth to th' center  yet after all comparisons of truth as truth's authentic author to be cited as true as troilus shall crown up the verse and sanctify the numbers amen dear trouble not yourself the morn is cold trouble him not to bed to bed sleep kill those pretty eyes and give as soft attachment to thy senses as infants' empty of all thought i prithee now to bed o cressida but that the busy day waked by the lark hath roused the ribald crows and dreaming night will hide our joys no longer i would not from thee beshrew the witch with venomous wights she stays as tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love with wings more momentary swift than thought you will catch cold and curse me it is your uncle ha ha how now what's the matter is it so concluded how my achievements mock me i will go meet them and my lord aeneas we met by chance you did not find me here walk into her house i'll bring her to the grecian presently and to his hand when i deliver her think it an altar and thy brother troilus a priest there off'ring to it his own heart cressid i love thee in so strained a purity that the blest gods as angry with my fancy  more bright in zeal than the devotion which cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me a hateful truth from troy and troilus and suddenly where injury of chance puts back leave taking jostles roughly by all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips of all rejoindure forcibly prevents our locked embrasures strangles our dear vows even in the birth of our own laboring breath we two that with so many thousand sighs did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves with the rude brevity and discharge of one injurious time now with a robber's haste crams his rich thiev'ry up he knows not how as many farewells as be stars in heaven with distinct breath and consigned kisses to them he fumbles up into a loose adieu and scants us with a single famished kiss distasted with the salt of broken tears hark you are called some say the genius cries so to him that instantly must die  bid them have patience she shall come anon no remedy hear me my love be thou but true of heart  nay we must use expostulation kindly for it is parting from us i speak not be thou true as fearing thee for i will throw my glove to death himself that there is no maculation in thy heart but be thou true say i to fashion in my sequent protestation be thou true and i will see thee and i'll grow friend with danger wear this sleeve i will corrupt the grecian sentinels to give thee nightly visitation but yet be true hear why i speak it love the grecian youths are full of quality their loving well composed with gift of nature flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise how novelty may move and parts with person alas a kind of godly jealousy  which i beseech you call a virtuous sin  makes me afeard die i a villain then in this i do not call your faith in question so mainly as my merit i cannot sing nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk nor play at subtle games fair virtues all to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant but i can tell that in each grace of these there lurks a still and dumb discursive devil that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted no but something may be done that we will not and sometimes we are devils to ourselves when we will tempt the frailty of our powers presuming on their changeful potency come kiss and let us part good brother come you hither and bring aeneas and the grecian with you who i alas it is my vice my fault whiles others fish with craft for great opinion i with great truth catch mere simplicity whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns with truth and plainness i do wear mine bare fear not my truth the moral of my wit is plain and true there's all the reach of it welcome sir diomed here is the lady which for antenor we deliver you at the port lord i'll give her to thy hand and by the way possess thee what she is entreat her fair and by my soul fair greek if e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword name cressid and thy life shall be as safe as priam is in ilium grecian thou dost not use me courteously to shame the zeal of my petition to thee in praising her i

though the great bulk achilles be thy guard i'll cut thy throat come to the port i'll tell thee diomed this brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head  lady give me your hand and as we walk to our own selves bend we our needful talk hector thou sleep'st awake thee my lord ulysses tell me i beseech you in what place of the field doth calchas keep shall i sweet lord be bound to you so much after we part from agamemnon's tent to bring me thither o sir to such as boasting show their scars a mock is due will you walk on my lord she was beloved she loved she is and doth but still sweet love is food

the world his voice was propertied as all the tun\u00e8d spheres and that to friends but when he meant to quail and shake the orb he was as rattling thunder for his bounty there was no winter in 't an autumn 'twas that grew the more by reaping his delights were dolphin like they showed his back above the element they lived in in his livery walked crowns and crownets realms and islands were as plates dropped from his pocket think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamt of you lie up to the hearing of the gods but if there be nor ever were one such it's past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy yet t' imagine an antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy condemning shadows quite i thank you sir know you what caesar means to do with me nay pray you sir he'll lead me then in triumph sir the gods will have it thus my master and my lord i must obey sole sir o' th' world i cannot project mine own cause so well to make it clear but do

i pray you all speak plainly your opinions of our hopes and first lord marshal what say you to it 'tis very true lord bardolph for indeed it was young hotspur's cause at shrewsbury that he should draw his several strengths together and come against us in full puissance need not to be dreaded let us on and publish the occasion of our arms the commonwealth is sick of their own choice their over greedy love hath surfeited an habitation giddy and unsure hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart o thou fond many with what loud applause didst thou beat heaven with blessing bolingbroke before he was what thou wouldst have him be and being now trimmed in thine own desires thou beastly feeder art so full of him that thou provok'st thyself to cast him up so so thou common dog didst thou disgorge thy glutton bosom of the royal richard and now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up and howl'st to find it what trust is in these times they that when richard lived would have him die are now become enamored on his grave thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head when through proud london he came sighing on after th' admir\u00e8d heels of bolingbroke criest now o earth yield us that king again and take thou this o thoughts of men accursed past and to come seems best things present worst what is this forest called here stand my lords and send discoverers forth to know the numbers of our enemies 'tis well done my friends and brethren in these great affairs i must acquaint you that i have received new dated letters from northumberland their cold intent tenor and substance thus here doth he wish his person with such powers as might hold sortance with his quality the which he could not levy whereupon he is retired to ripe his growing fortunes to scotland and concludes in hearty prayers that your attempts may overlive the hazard and fearful meeting of their opposite what well appointed leader fronts us here say on my lord of westmoreland in peace what doth concern your coming wherefore do i this so the question stands briefly to this end we are all diseased and with our surfeiting and wanton hours have brought ourselves into a burning fever and we must bleed for it of which disease our late king richard being infected died but my most noble lord of westmoreland i take not on me here as a physician nor do i as an enemy to peace troop in the throngs of military men but rather show awhile like fearful war to diet rank minds sick of happiness and purge th' obstructions which begin to stop our very veins of life hear me more plainly i have in equal balance justly weighed what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer and find our griefs heavier than our offenses we see which way the stream of time doth run and are enforced from our most quiet there by the rough torrent of occasion and have the summary of all our griefs when time shall serve to show in articles which long ere this we offered to the king and might by no suit gain our audience when we are wronged and would unfold our griefs we are denied access unto his person even by those men that most have done us wrong the dangers of the days but newly gone whose memory is written on the earth with yet appearing blood and the examples of every minute's instance present now hath put us in these ill beseeming arms not to break peace or any branch of it but to establish here a peace indeed concurring both in name and quality my brother general the commonwealth to brother born an household cruelty i make my quarrel in particular then take my lord of westmoreland this schedule for this contains our general grievances each several article herein redressed all members of our cause both here and hence that are insinewed to this action acquitted by a true substantial form and present execution of our wills to us and to our purposes confined we come within our awful banks again and knit our powers to the arm of peace my lord we will do so no no my lord note this the king is weary of dainty and such picking grievances for he hath found to end one doubt by death revives two greater in the heirs of life and therefore will he wipe his tables clean and keep no telltale to his memory that may repeat and history his loss to new remembrance for full well he knows he cannot so precisely weed this land as his misdoubts present occasion his foes are so enrooted with his friends that plucking to unfix an enemy he doth unfasten so and shake a friend so that this land like an offensive wife that hath enraged him on to offer strokes as he is striking holds his infant up and hangs resolved correction in the arm that was upreared to execution 'tis very true and therefore be assured my good lord marshal if we do now make our atonement well our peace will like a broken limb united grow stronger for the breaking before and greet his grace my lord we come good my lord of lancaster i am not here against your father's peace but as i told my lord of westmoreland the time misordered doth in common sense crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form to hold our safety up i sent your grace the parcels and particulars of our grief the which hath been with scorn shoved from the court whereon this hydra son of war is born whose dangerous eyes may well be charmed asleep with grant of our most just and right desires and true obedience of this madness cured stoop tamely to the foot of majesty i take your princely word for these redresses to you my noble lord of westmoreland i do not doubt you against ill chances men are ever merry but heaviness foreruns the good event

nourished him as i did with my blood thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart blood there rather than have made that savage duke thine heir and disinherited thine only son enforced thee art thou king and wilt be forced i shame to hear thee speak ah timorous wretch thou hast undone thyself thy son and me and giv'n unto the house of york such head as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance to entail him and his heirs unto the crown what is it but to make thy sepulcher and creep into it far before thy time warwick is chancellor and the lord of callice stern falconbridge commands the narrow

wear a crown a crown for york and lords bow low to him hold you his hands whilst i do set it on ay marry sir now looks he like a king ay this is he that took king henry's chair and this is he was his adopted heir but how is it that great plantagenet is crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath  as i bethink me you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death and will you pale your head in henry's glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life against your holy oath o 'tis a fault too too unpardonable off with the crown and with the crown his head and whilst we

to be thus bold in terms before thy sovereign and thy lawful king why how now long tongued warwick dare you speak when you and i met at saint albans last your legs did better service than your hands defy them then or else hold close thy lips but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam but like a foul misshapen stigmatic marked by the destinies to be avoided as venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings stay edward mount you my lord towards berwick post amain edward and richard like a brace of greyhounds having the fearful flying hare in sight with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath and bloody steel grasped in their ireful hands are at our backs and therefore hence amain no mighty king of france now margaret must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve where kings command i was i must confess great albion's queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down and with dishonor laid me on the ground where i must take like seat unto my fortune and to my humble seat conform myself from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue while heart is drowned in cares those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my tongue tied sorrows leave to speak now therefore be it known to noble lewis that henry sole possessor of my love is of a king become a banished man and forced to live in scotland a forlorn while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of england's true anointed lawful king this is the cause that i poor margaret with this my son prince edward henry's heir am come to crave thy just and lawful aid and if thou fail us all our hope is done scotland hath will to help but cannot help our people and our peers are both misled our treasure seized our soldiers put to flight and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight the more we stay the stronger grows our foe o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow our earl of warwick edward's greatest friend ay now begins a second storm to rise for this is he that moves both wind and tide if that go forward henry's hope is done king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick his demand springs not from edward's well meant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henry's son look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonor for though usurpers sway the rule awhile yet heav'ns are just and time suppresseth wrongs heavens grant that warwick's words bewitch him not deceitful warwick it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henry's friend peace impudent and shameless warwick proud setter up and puller down of kings i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys i told your majesty as much before this proveth edward's love and warwick's honesty warwick these words have turned my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becom'st king henry's friend renown\u00e8d prince how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair let me give humble thanks for all at once tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armor on yes i agree and thank you for your motion son edward she is fair and virtuous therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable that only warwick's daughter shall be thine great lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss but cheerly seek how to redress their harms what though the mast be now blown overboard the cable broke the holding anchor lost and half our sailors swallowed in the flood yet lives our pilot still is 't meet that he should leave the helm and like a fearful lad with tearful eyes add water to the sea and give more strength to that which hath too much whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock which industry and courage might have saved ah what a shame ah what a fault were this say warwick was our anchor what of that and montague our topmast what of him our slaughtered friends the tackles what of these why is not oxford here another anchor and somerset another goodly mast the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings and though unskillful why not ned and i for once allowed the skillful pilot's charge we will not from the helm to sit and weep but keep our course though the rough wind say no from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wrack as good to chide the waves as speak them fair and what is edward but a ruthless sea what clarence but a quicksand of deceit and richard but a ragged fatal rock  all these the enemies to our poor bark say you can swim alas 'tis but awhile tread on the sand why there you quickly sink bestride the rock the tide will wash you off or else you famish that's a threefold death this speak i lords to let you understand if case some one of you would fly from us that there's no hoped for mercy with the brothers more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks why courage then what cannot be avoided 'twere childish weakness to lament or fear thanks gentle somerset sweet oxford thanks this cheers my heart to see your forwardness lords knights and gentlemen what i should say my tears gainsay for every word i speak you see i drink the water of my eye therefore no more but this henry your sovereign is prisoner to the foe his state usurped his realm a slaughterhouse his subjects slain his statutes cancelled and his treasure spent and yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil you fight in justice then in god's name lords be valiant and give signal to the fight so part

villains bloody cannibals how sweet a plant have you untimely cropped you have no children butchers if you had the thought of them would have stirred up remorse but if you ever chance to have a child look in his youth to have him so cut off as deathsmen you have rid this sweet young prince nay never bear me hence dispatch me here here sheathe thy sword i'll pardon thee my death what wilt thou not

raised the tempest say my spirit how fares the king and 's followers dost thou think so spirit and mine shall hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling of their afflictions and shall not myself one of their kind that relish all as sharply passion as they be kindlier moved than thou art though with their high wrongs i am struck to th' quick yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury do i take part the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent the sole drift of my purpose doth extend not a frown further go release them ariel my charms i'll break their senses i'll

masters though you be i have bedimmed the noontide sun called forth the mutinous winds and 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder have i given fire and rifted jove's stout oak with his own bolt the strong based promontory have i made shake and by the spurs plucked up the pine and cedar graves at my command have waked their sleepers oped and let 'em forth by my so potent art but this rough magic i here abjure and when i have required some heavenly music which even now i do to work mine end upon their senses that this airy charm is for i'll break

will pay thy graces home both in word and deed most cruelly didst thou alonso use me and my daughter thy brother was a furtherer in the act  thou art pinched for 't now sebastian flesh and blood you brother mine that entertained ambition expelled remorse and nature whom with sebastian whose inward pinches therefore are most strong would here have killed your king i do forgive thee unnatural though thou art their understanding begins to swell and the approaching tide will shortly fill the reasonable shore that now lies foul and muddy not one of them that yet looks on me or would know me

have not sought her help of whose soft grace for the like loss i have her sovereign aid and rest myself content as great to me as late and supportable to make the dear loss have i means much weaker than you may call to comfort you for i have lost my daughter in this last tempest i perceive these lords at this encounter do so much admire that they devour their reason and scarce think their eyes

waste with such discourse as i not doubt shall make it go quick away the story of my life and the particular accidents gone by since i came to this isle and in the morn i'll bring you to your ship and so to naples where i have hope to see the nuptial of these our dear belov\u00e8d solemnized and thence retire me to my milan where every third thought shall be my grave i'll deliver all and promise

pardoned the deceiver dwell in this bare island by your spell but release me from my bands with the help of your good hands gentle breath of yours my sails must fill or else my project fails which was

as lift them against the roman state whose course will on the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong link asunder than can ever appear in your impediment for the dearth the gods not the patricians make it and your knees to them not arms must help alack you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you and you slander the helms o' th' state who care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious or be accused of folly i shall tell you a pretty tale it may be you have heard it but since it serves my purpose i will venture to stale 't a little more there was a time when all the body's members rebelled against the belly thus accused it that only like a gulf it did remain i' th' midst o' th' body idle and unactive still cupboarding the viand never bearing like labor with the rest where th' other instruments did see and hear devise instruct walk feel and mutually participate did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body the belly answered  sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus  for look you i may make the belly smile as well as speak it tauntingly replied to th' discontented members the mutinous parts that envied his receipt even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you what then 'fore me this fellow speaks what then what then well what then i will tell you if you'll bestow a small of what you have little  patience awhile you'st hear the belly's answer note me this good friend your most grave belly was deliberate not rash like his accusers and thus answered true is it my incorporate friends quoth he that i receive the general food at first which you do live upon and fit it is because i am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body but if you do remember i send it through the rivers of your blood even to the court the heart to th' seat o' th' brain and through the cranks and offices of man the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live and though that all at once you my good friends this says the belly mark me  though all at once cannot see what i do deliver out to each yet i can make my audit up that all from me do back receive the flour of all and leave me but the bran what say you to 't the senators of rome are this good belly and you the mutinous members for examine their counsels and their cares digest things rightly touching the weal o' th' common you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves what do you think you the great toe of this assembly for that being one o' th' lowest basest poorest of this most wise rebellion thou goest foremost thou rascal that art worst in blood to run lead'st first to win some vantage but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs rome and her rats are at the point of battle the one side must have bale hail noble martius for corn at their own rates whereof they say the city is well stored nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you what says the other troop what is granted them this is strange o true bred the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight not according to the prayer of the people for they love not martius pray you who does the wolf love ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble martius he's a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you in what enormity is martius poor in that you two have not in abundance this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city i mean of us o' th' right hand file do you because you talk of pride now will you not be angry why 'tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so you blame martius for being proud i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves o that you could why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber in 't said to be something imperfect in favoring the first complaint hasty and tinder like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as you are i cannot call you lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it i cannot say your worships have delivered the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too what harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too you know neither me yourselves nor anything you are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a faucet seller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves you are a pair of strange ones our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honorable a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entombed in an ass's packsaddle yet you must be saying martius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary hangmen good e'en to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you how now my as fair as noble ladies and the moon were she earthly no nobler whither do you follow your eyes so fast ha martius coming home take my cap jupiter and i thank thee hoo martius coming home i will make my very house reel tonight a letter for me a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven years' health in which time i will make a lip at the physician the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horse drench is he not wounded he was wont to come home wounded so do i too if it be not too much brings he victory in his pocket the wounds become him has he disciplined aufidius soundly and 'twas time for him too i'll warrant him that an he had stayed by him i would not have been so 'fidiused for all the chests in corioles and the gold that's in them is the senate possessed of this wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his true purchasing true i'll be sworn they are true where is he wounded god save your good worships martius is coming home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded one i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh there's nine that i know now it's twenty seven every gash was an enemy's grave hark the trumpets welcome to rome renown\u00e8d coriolanus now the gods crown thee a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome a curse begin at very root on 's heart that is not glad to see thee you are three that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men we have some old crab trees here at home that will not be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our after meeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our well found successes to report a little of that worthy work performed by martius caius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honors like himself that's off that's off i would you rather had been silent please you to hear cominius speak he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow  worthy cominius speak nay keep your place pray now sit down masters of the people your multiplying spawn how can he flatter  that's thousand to one good one when you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honor than one on 's ears to hear it proceed cominius worthy man he's right noble let him be called for the senate coriolanus are well pleased to make thee consul it then remains that you do speak to the people put them not to 't pray you go fit you to the custom and take to you as your predecessors have your honor with your form do not stand upon 't  we recommend to you tribunes of the people our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honor o sir you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have done 't o me the gods you must not speak of that you must desire them to think upon you you'll mar all i'll leave you pray you speak to 'em i pray you in wholesome manner you have stood your limitation and the tribunes endue you with the people's voice remains that in th' official marks invested you anon do meet the senate i'll keep you company will you along the matter be calm be calm let's be calm not now not now well no more what what his choler well well no more of that come enough on both sides more respect peace peace peace stay hold peace what is about to be i am out of breath confusion's near i cannot speak you tribunes to th' people coriolanus patience  speak good sicinius fie fie fie this is the way to kindle not to quench and so are like to do hear me one word beseech you tribunes hear me but a word be that you seem truly your country's friend and temp'rately proceed to what you would thus violently redress down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile help martius help you that be noble help him young and old go get you to your house begone away all will be naught else shall it be put to that for 'tis a sore upon us you cannot tent yourself begone beseech you begone put not your worthy rage into your tongue one time will owe another i could myself take up a brace o' th' best of them yea the two tribunes pray you begone i'll try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little this must be patched with cloth of any color his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove for 's power to thunder his heart's his mouth what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry does forget that ever he heard the name of death here's goodly work i would they were in tiber what the vengeance could he not speak 'em fair you worthy tribunes  sir sir  do not cry havoc where you should but hunt with modest warrant hear me speak as i do know the consul's worthiness so can i name his faults the consul coriolanus if by the tribunes' leave and yours good people i may be heard i would crave a word or two the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time now the good gods forbid that our renown\u00e8d rome whose gratitude towards her deserv\u00e8d children is enrolled in jove's own book like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own o he's a limb that has but a disease  mortal to cut it off to cure it easy what has he done to rome that's worthy death killing our enemies the blood he hath lost  which i dare vouch is more than that he hath by many an ounce he dropped it for his country and what is left to lose it by his country were to us all that do 't and suffer it a brand to th' end o' th' world one word more one word this tiger footed rage when it shall find the harm of unscanned swiftness will too late tie leaden pounds to 's heels proceed by process lest parties as he is beloved break out and sack great rome with romans consider this he has been bred i' th' wars since he could draw a sword and is ill schooled in bolted language meal and bran together he throws without distinction give me leave i'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril i'll bring him to you let me desire your company he must come or what is worst will follow come come you have been too rough something too rough you must return and mend it well said noble woman before he should thus stoop to th' herd but that the violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic for the whole state i would put mine armor on which i can scarcely bear return to th' tribunes repent what you have spoke a good demand noble lady  come go with us speak fair you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the loss of what is past this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being asked as free as words to little purpose only fair speech ay but mildly calmly i do beseech you a noble wish lo citizens he says he is content the warlike service he has done consider think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves i' th' holy churchyard consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you nay temperately your promise is this the promise that you made your mother that's worthily as any ear can hear come let's not weep if i could shake off but one seven years from these old arms and legs by the good gods i'd with thee every foot peace peace be not so loud come come peace you have told them home and by my troth you have cause you'll sup with me fie fie fie hail to you both all's well and might have been much better if he could have temporized nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife hear nothing from him i think not so 'tis aufidius who hearing of our martius' banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world which were inshelled when martius stood for rome and durst not once peep out cannot be we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like hath been within my age but reason with the fellow before you punish him where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atone than violent'st contrariety what news what news what's the news what's the news pray now your news  you have made fair work i fear me pray your news if martius should be joined with volscians  you have made good work you and your apron men you that stood so much upon the voice of occupation and the breath of garlic eaters as hercules did shake down mellow fruit you have made fair work we are all undone unless the noble man have mercy 'tis true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it i have not the face to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands you and your crafts you have crafted fair how was 't we we loved him but like beasts and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o' th' city here come the clusters  and is aufidius with him you are they that made the air unwholesome when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus' exile now he's coming and not a hair upon a soldier's head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down and pay you for your voices 'tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal we have deserved it you have made good work you and your cry  shall 's to the capitol no i'll not go you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general who loved him in a most dear particular he called me father but what o' that go you that banished him a mile before his tent fall down and knee the way into his mercy nay if he coyed to hear cominius speak i'll keep at home do you hear why so you have made good work a pair of tribunes that have wracked rome to make coals cheap a noble memory very well could he say less for one poor grain or two i am one of those his mother wife his child and this brave fellow too we are the grains you are the musty chaff and you are smelt above the moon we must be burnt for you no i'll not meddle what should i do well and say that martius return me as cominius is returned unheard what then but as a discontented friend grief shot with his unkindness say 't be so i'll undertake 't i think he'll hear me yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me he was not taken well he had not dined the veins unfilled our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuffed these pipes and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priestlike fasts therefore i'll watch him till he be dieted to my request and then i'll set upon him good faith i'll prove him speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge of my success you guard like men 'tis well but by your leave i am an officer of state and come to speak with coriolanus from rome good my friends if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name hath touched your ears it is menenius i tell thee fellow thy general is my lover i have been the book of his good acts whence men have read his fame unparalleled happily amplified for i have ever verified my friends  of whom he's chief with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes like to a bowl upon a subtle ground i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise have almost stamped the leasing therefore fellow i must have leave to pass prithee fellow remember my name is menenius always factionary on the party of your general has he dined can'st thou tell for i would not speak with him till after dinner i am as thy general is sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me with estimation i mean thy general nay but fellow fellow  now you companion i'll say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from my son coriolanus guess but by my entertainment with him if thou stand'st not i' th' state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueler in suffering behold now presently and swoon for what's to come upon thee the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does o my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee here's water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this who like a block hath denied my access to thee how away i neither care for th' world nor your general for such things as you i can scarce think there's any you're so slight he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst for you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age i say to you as i was said to away see you yond coign o' th' capitol yond cornerstone if it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of rome especially his mother may prevail with him but i say there is no hope in 't our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution there is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub this martius is grown from man to dragon he has wings he's more than a creeping thing so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight year old horse the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery he sits in his state as a thing made for alexander what he bids be done is finished with his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in i paint him in the character mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find and all this is long of you no in such a case the gods will not be good unto us when we banished him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us this is good news i will go meet the ladies this volumnia is worth of consuls senators patricians a city full of tribunes such as you a sea and land full you have

with the cooling wind and make a checkered shadow on the ground under their sweet shade aaron let us sit and whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds replying shrilly to the well tuned horns as if a double hunt were heard at once let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise and after conflict such as was supposed the wand'ring prince and dido once enjoyed when with a happy storm they were surprised and curtained with a counsel keeping cave we may each wreath\u00e8d in the other's arms our pastimes done possess a golden slumber whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds be unto us as is a nurse's song of lullaby to bring her babe asleep ah my sweet moor sweeter to me than life saucy controller of my private steps had i the power that some say dian had thy temples should be planted presently with horns as was acteon's and the hounds should drive upon thy new transform\u00e8d limbs unmannerly intruder as thou art why i have patience to endure all this have i not reason think you to look pale these two have ticed me hither to this place a barren detested vale you see it is the trees though summer yet forlorn and lean overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe here never shines the sun here nothing breeds unless the nightly owl or fatal raven and when they showed me this abhorr\u00e8d pit they told me here at dead time of the night a thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins would make such fearful and confus\u00e8d cries as any mortal body hearing it should straight fall mad or else die suddenly no sooner had they told this hellish tale but straight they told me they would bind me here unto the body of a dismal yew and leave me to this miserable death and then they called me foul adulteress lascivious goth and all the bitterest terms that ever ear did hear to such effect and had you not by wondrous fortune come this vengeance on me had they executed revenge it as you love your mother's life or be you not henceforth called my children give me the poniard you shall know my boys your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong but when you have the honey you desire let not this wasp outlive us both

vain to save your brother from the sacrifice but fierce andronicus would not relent therefore away with her and use her as you will the worse to her the better loved of me what begg'st thou then fond woman let me go so should i rob my sweet sons of their fee no let them satisfy their lust on thee farewell my sons see that you make her sure ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed till all the andronici be made away now will i hence to seek my lovely moor and let my spleenful sons this trull deflower where is my lord the king where is thy brother bassianus then all too late i bring this fatal writ the complot of this timeless tragedy and wonder greatly that man's face can fold in pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny what are they in this pit o wondrous thing how easily murder is

strong king be thy thoughts imperious like thy name is the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it the eagle suffers little birds to sing and is not careful what they mean thereby knowing that with the shadow of his wings he can at pleasure stint their melody even so mayst thou the giddy men of rome then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor i will enchant the old andronicus with words more sweet and yet more dangerous than baits to fish or honey stalks to sheep whenas the one is wounded with the bait the other rotted with delicious feed if tamora entreat him then he will for i can smooth and fill his ag\u00e8d ears with golden promises that were his heart almost impregnable his old ears deaf yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue go thou before to be our ambassador say that the emperor requests a parley of warlike lucius and appoint the meeting even at his father's house the old andronicus now will i to that old andronicus and temper him with all the art i have to pluck proud lucius from the warlike goths and now sweet emperor be blithe again and bury all thy fear in my devices thus in this strange and sad habiliment i will encounter with andronicus and say i am revenge sent from below to join with him and right his heinous wrongs knock at his study where they say he keeps to ruminate strange plots of dire revenge tell him revenge is come to join with him and work confusion on his enemies titus i am come to talk with thee if thou didst know me thou wouldst talk with me know thou sad man i am not tamora she is thy enemy and i thy friend i am revenge sent from th' infernal kingdom to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind by working wreakful vengeance on thy foes come down and welcome me to this world's light confer with me of murder and of death there's not a hollow cave or lurking place no vast obscurity or misty vale where bloody murder or detested rape can couch for fear but i will find them out and in their ears tell them my dreadful name revenge which makes the foul offender quake i am therefore come down and welcome me these are my ministers and come with me rape and murder therefore call\u00e8d so 'cause they take vengeance of such kind of men this closing with him fits his lunacy whate'er i forge to feed his brainsick humors do you uphold and maintain in your speeches for now he firmly takes me for revenge and being credulous in this mad thought i'll make him send for lucius his son and whilst i at a banquet hold him sure i'll find some cunning practice out of hand to scatter and disperse the giddy goths or at the least make them his enemies see here he comes and i must ply my theme what wouldst thou have us do andronicus show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong and i will be reveng\u00e8d on them all well hast thou lessoned us this shall we do but would it please thee good andronicus to send for lucius thy thrice valiant son who leads towards rome a band of warlike goths and bid him come and banquet at thy house when he is here even at thy solemn feast i will bring in the empress and her sons the emperor himself and all thy foes and at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel and on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart what says andronicus to this device now will i hence about thy business and take my ministers along with me what say you boys will you abide with him whiles i go tell my lord the emperor how i

breathing to his breathless excellence the incense of a vow a holy vow never to taste the pleasures of the world never to be infected with delight nor conversant with ease and idleness till i have set

speaks bid every noise be still peace yet again you pulled me by the cloak would you speak with me why you were with him were you not why there was a crown offered him and being offered him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell a shouting why for that too why for that too ay marry was 't and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shouted why antony i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark antony offer him a crown yet 'twas not a crown neither 'twas one of these coronets and as i told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it and then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked caesar for he swooned and fell down at it and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down if the tag rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theater i am no true man marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut an i had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogues and so he fell when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity three or four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts but there's no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less ay ay he spoke greek nay an i tell you that i'll ne'er look you i' th' face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarves off caesar's images are put to silence fare you well there was more foolery yet if i could remember it no i am promised forth ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating do so farewell both are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen th' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threat'ning clouds but never till tonight never till now did i go through a tempest dropping fire either there is a civil strife in heaven or else the world too saucy with the gods incenses them to send destruction a common slave you know him well by sight held up his left hand which did flame and burn like twenty torches joined and yet his hand not sensible of fire remained unscorched besides i ha' not since put up my sword against the capitol i met a lion who glazed upon me and went surly by without annoying me and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transform\u00e8d with their fear who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noonday upon the marketplace hooting and shrieking when these prodigies do so conjointly meet let not men say these are their reasons they are natural for i

our last king whose image even but now appeared to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride dared to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteemed him did slay this fortinbras who by a sealed compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seized of to the

they distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had delivered both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up its head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanished from our sight as i do live my honored lord 'tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it we do my lord armed my lord my lord from head to foot o yes my lord he wore his beaver up a countenance more in

as pregnant in as art and practice hath enrich\u00e8d any that we remember there is our commission from which we would not have you warp call hither i say bid come before us angelo what figure of us think you he will bear for you must know we have with special soul elected him our absence to supply lent him our terror dressed him with our love and given his deputation all the organs of our own power what think you of it look where he comes angelo there is a kind of character in thy life that to th' observer doth thy history fully unfold thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues they on thee heaven doth with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us 'twere all alike as if we had them not spirits are not finely touched but to fine issues nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines herself the glory of a creditor both thanks and use but i do bend my speech to one that can my part in him advertise hold therefore angelo in our remove be thou at full ourself mortality and mercy in vienna live in thy tongue and heart old escalus though first in question is thy secondary take thy commission no more evasion we have with a leavened and prepar\u00e8d choice proceeded to you therefore take your honors our haste from

scope is as mine own so to enforce or qualify the laws as to your soul seems good give me your hand i'll privily away i love the people but do not like to stage me to their eyes though it do well i do not relish well their loud applause and aves vehement nor do i think the man of safe discretion that does affect it once more fare you well i thank you fare you well no holy father throw away that thought believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee to give me secret harbor hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth my holy sir none better knows than you how i have ever loved the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth and cost witless bravery keeps i have delivered to lord angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence my absolute power and place here in vienna and he supposes me traveled to poland for so i have strewed it in the common ear and so it is received now pious sir you will demand of me why i do this we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds which for this fourteen years we have let slip even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch only to stick it in their children's sight for terror not to use in time the rod more mocked than feared so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum i do fear too dreadful sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope 'twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment therefore indeed my father i have on angelo imposed the office who may in th' ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander and to behold his sway i will as 'twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people therefore i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear like a true friar more reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you only this one lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone hence shall we see if power change purpose what our seemers be hail to you provost so i think you are bound by my charity and my blest order i come to visit the afflicted spirits here in the prison do me the common right to let me see them and to make me know the nature of their crimes that i may minister to them accordingly when must he die repent you fair one of the sin you carry i'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience and try your penitence if it be sound or hollowly put on love you the man that wronged you so then it seems your most offenseful act was mutually committed then was your sin of heavier kind than his 'tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven showing we would not spare heaven as we love it but as we stand in fear  there rest your partner as i hear must die tomorrow and i am going with instruction to him grace go with you benedicite so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo be absolute for death either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep a breath thou art servile to all the skyey influences that doth this habitation where thou keep'st hourly afflict merely thou art death's fool for him thou labor'st by thy flight to shun and yet runn'st toward him still thou art not noble for all th' accommodations that thou bear'st are nursed by baseness thou 'rt by no means valiant for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provok'st yet grossly fear'st thy death which is no more thou art not thyself for thou exists on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou striv'st to get and what thou hast forget'st thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon if thou art rich thou 'rt poor for like an

loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an after dinner's sleep dreaming on both for all thy bless\u00e8d youth becomes as ag\u00e8d and doth beg the alms of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant what's yet in this that bears the name of life yet in this life lie hid more thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes these odds all even dear sir ere long i'll visit you again provost a word with you bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed vouchsafe a word young sister but one word might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction i would require is likewise your own benefit son i have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practice his judgment with the disposition of natures she having the truth of honor in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make ready hold you there farewell provost a word with you that now you are come you will be gone leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair the assault that angelo hath made to you fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo how will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have you not heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea she should this angelo have married was affianced to her oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was wracked at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriage dowry with both her combinate husband this well seeming angelo left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonor in few bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonor in doing it this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience this being granted in course and now follows all we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honor untainted the poor mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt if you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof what think you of it it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction i will presently to saint luke's there at the moated grange resides this dejected mariana at that place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that it may be quickly o heavens what stuff is here and you good brother father what offense hath this man made you sir fie sirrah a bawd a wicked bawd the evil that thou causest to be done that is thy means to live do thou but think what 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back from such a filthy vice say to thyself from their abominable and beastly touches i drink i eat array myself and live canst thou believe thy living is a life so stinkingly depending go mend go mend nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin thou wilt prove his take him to prison officer correction and instruction must both work ere this rude beast will profit that we were all as some would seem to be from our faults as faults from seeming free still thus and thus still worse and you i know none can you tell me of any i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well he does well in 't it is too general a vice and severity must cure it how should he be made then you are pleasant sir and speak apace i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way 'tis not possible you do him wrong surely what i prithee might be the cause wise why no question but he was either this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own bringings forth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier therefore you speak unskillfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call upon you and i pray you your name he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you o you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i can do you little harm you'll forswear this again why should he die sir no might nor greatness in mortality can censure scape back wounding calumny the whitest virtue strikes what king so strong can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue but who comes here bliss and goodness on you not of this country though my chance is now to use it for my time i am a brother of gracious order late come from the see in special business from his holiness none but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accursed much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this news is old enough yet it is every day's news i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke what pleasure was he given to he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which i by my good leisure have discredited to him and now is he resolved to die if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced himself peace be with you he who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severe pattern in himself to know grace to stand and virtue go more nor less to others paying than by self offenses weighing shame to him whose cruel striking kills for faults of his own liking twice treble shame on angelo to weed my vice and let his grow o what may man within him hide though angel on the outward side how may likeness made in crimes making practice on the times to draw with idle spiders' strings most ponderous and substantial things craft against vice i must apply with angelo tonight shall lie his old betroth\u00e8d but despis\u00e8d so disguise shall by th' disguis\u00e8d pay with falsehood false exacting and perform an old contracting 'tis good though music oft hath such a charm to make bad good and good provoke to harm i pray you tell me hath anybody inquired for me here today much upon this time have i promised here to meet i do constantly believe you the time is come even now i shall crave your forbearance a little maybe i will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself very well met and welcome what is the news from this good deputy but shall you on your knowledge find this way are there no other tokens between you 'greed concerning her observance 'tis well borne up i have not yet made known to mariana a word of this what ho within come forth i pray you be acquainted with this maid she comes to do you good do you persuade yourself that i respect you take then this your companion by the hand who hath a story ready for your ear i shall attend your leisure but make haste the vaporous night approaches o place and greatness millions of false eyes are stuck upon thee volumes of report run with these false and most contrarious quest upon thy doings thousand escapes of wit make thee the father of their idle dream and rack thee in their fancies welcome how agreed it is not my consent but my entreaty too nor gentle daughter fear you not at all he is your husband on a precontract to bring you thus together 'tis no sin sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit come let us go our corn's to reap for yet our tithe's to sow the best and wholesom'st spirits of the night envelop you good provost who called here of late not isabel they will then ere 't be long there's some in hope not so not so his life is paralleled even with the stroke and line of his great justice he doth with holy abstinence subdue that in himself which he spurs on his power to qualify in others were he mealed with that which he corrects then were he tyrannous but this being so he's just now are they come this is a gentle provost seldom when the steel\u00e8d jailer is the friend of men how now what noise that spirit's possessed with haste that wounds th' unsisting postern with these strokes have you no countermand for claudio yet but he must die tomorrow as near the dawning provost as it is you shall hear more ere morning and here comes claudio's pardon this is his pardon purchased by such sin for which the pardoner himself is in hence hath offense his quick celerity when it is borne in high authority when vice makes mercy mercy's so extended that for the fault's love is th' offender friended now sir what news pray you let's hear what is that barnardine who is to be executed in th' afternoon how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him i have heard it was ever his manner to do so it is now apparent hath he borne himself penitently in prison how seems he to be touched he wants advice more of him anon there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him to make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four days' respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy in the delaying death by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions may be your guide let this barnardine be this morning executed and his head borne to angelo o death's a great disguiser and you may add to it shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common if anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against it with my life were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy you will think you have made no offense if the duke

brother for this new married man approaching here whose salt imagination yet hath wronged your well defended honor you must pardon for mariana's sake but as he adjudged your brother  being criminal in double violation of sacred chastity and of promise breach thereon dependent for your brother's life  the very mercy of the law cries out most audible even from his proper tongue an angelo for claudio death for death haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure like doth quit like and measure still for measure  then angelo thy fault's thus manifested which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage we do condemn thee to the very block where claudio stooped to death and with like haste  away with him it is your husband mocked you with a husband consenting to the safeguard of your honor i thought your marriage fit else imputation for that he knew you might reproach your life and choke your good to come for his possessions although by confiscation they are ours we do instate and widow

dreams not knowing what they fear but full of fear and here's a prophet that i brought with me from forth the streets of pomfret whom i found with many hundreds treading on his heels to whom he sung in rude harsh sounding rhymes that ere the next ascension day at noon your highness should deliver up your crown the french my lord men's mouths are full of it besides i met lord bigot and lord salisbury with eyes as red as new enkindled fire and others more going to seek the grave of arthur whom they say is killed tonight on your suggestion i will seek them out the spirit of the time shall

boundless reach of mercy if thou didst this deed of death art thou damned hubert ha i'll tell thee what thou 'rt damned as black nay nothing is so black  thou art more deep damned than prince lucifer there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell as thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child if thou didst but consent to this most cruel act do but despair and if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread that ever spider twisted from her womb will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself put but a little water in a spoon and it shall be as all the ocean enough to stifle such a villain up i do suspect thee very grievously go bear him in thine arms i am amazed methinks and lose my way among the thorns and dangers of this world how easy dost thou take all england up from forth this morsel of dead royalty the life the right and truth of all this realm is fled to heaven and england now is left to tug and scamble and to part by th' teeth the unowed interest of proud swelling state now for the bare picked bone of majesty doth dogg\u00e8d war bristle his angry crest and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace now powers from home and discontents at home meet in one line and vast confusion waits as doth a raven on a sick fall'n beast the imminent decay of wrested pomp now happy he whose cloak and cincture can hold out this tempest

dauntless spirit of resolution away and glister like the god of war when he intendeth to become the field show boldness and aspiring confidence what shall they seek the lion in his den and fright him there and make him tremble there o let it not be said forage and run to meet displeasure farther from the doors and grapple with him ere he come so nigh o inglorious league shall we upon the footing of our land send fair play orders and make compromise insinuation parley and base truce to arms invasive shall a beardless boy a cockered silken wanton brave our fields and flesh his spirit in a warlike soil mocking the air with colors idly spread and find no check let us my liege to arms perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace or if he do let it at least be said they saw we had a purpose of defense away then with good courage yet i know our party may well meet a prouder foe according to the fair play of the world let me have audience i am sent to speak my holy lord of milan

cudgel you and make you take the hatch to dive like buckets in conceal\u00e8d wells to crouch in litter of your stable planks to lie like pawns locked up in chests and trunks to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake even at the crying of your nation's crow thinking this voice an arm\u00e8d englishman  shall that victorious hand be feebled here that in your chambers gave you chastisement no know the gallant monarch is in arms and like an eagle o'er his aerie towers to souse annoyance that comes near his nest  and you degenerate you ingrate revolts

gauntlets change their needles to lances and their gentle hearts to fierce and bloody inclination no i will speak indeed your drums being beaten will cry out and so shall you being beaten do but start an echo with the clamor of thy drum and even at hand a drum is ready braced that shall reverberate all as loud as thine sound but another and another shall as loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear and

in your right spheres where be your powers show now your mended faiths and instantly return with me again to push destruction and perpetual shame out of the weak door of our fainting land straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought the dauphin rages at our very heels he will the rather do it when he sees ourselves well sinew\u00e8d to our defense let it be so and you my noble prince with other princes that may best be spared shall wait upon your father's funeral thither shall it then and happily may your sweet self put on the lineal state and glory of the land to whom with all

courtly company or at my beads with you mine alderliefest sovereign makes me the bolder to salute my king with ruder terms such as my wit affords and overjoy of heart doth minister we thank you all to my lord protector are your supplications to his lordship let me see them what is thine what sayst thou did the duke of york say he was rightful heir to the crown and as for you that love to be protected under the wings of our protector's grace begin your suits anew and sue to him away base cullions suffolk let them go my lord of suffolk say is this the guise is this the fashions in the court of england is this the government of britain's isle and this the royalty of albion's king what shall king henry be a pupil still under the surly gloucester's governance am i a queen in title and in style and must be made a subject to a duke i tell thee pole when in the city tours thou rann'st atilt in honor of my love and stol'st away the ladies' hearts of france i thought king henry had resembled thee in courage courtship and proportion but all his mind is bent to holiness to number ave marys on his beads his champions are the prophets and apostles his weapons holy saws of sacred writ his study is his tiltyard and his loves are brazen images of canonized saints i would the college of the cardinals would choose him pope and carry him to rome and set the triple crown upon his head that were a state fit for his holiness besides the haughty protector have we beaufort the imperious churchman somerset buckingham and grumbling york and not the least of these but can do more in england than the king not all these lords do vex me half so much as that proud dame the lord protector's wife she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies more like an empress than duke humphrey's wife strangers in court do take her for the queen she bears a duke's revenues on her back and in her heart she scorns our poverty shall i not live to be avenged on her contemptuous baseborn callet as she is she vaunted 'mongst her minions t' other day the very train of her worst wearing gown was better worth than all my father's lands till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter because the king forsooth will have it so if he be old enough what needs your grace to be protector of his excellence thy sale of offices and towns in france if they were known as the suspect is great would make thee quickly hop without thy head give me my fan what minion can you not i cry you mercy madam was it you believe me lords for flying at the brook i saw not better sport these seven years' day yet by your leave the wind was very high and ten to one old joan had not gone out and thy ambition gloucester tell me good fellow cam'st thou here by chance or of devotion to this holy shrine it made me laugh to see the villain run gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest and look thyself be faultless thou wert best i see no reason why a king of years should be to be protected like a child god and king henry govern england's realm  give up your staff sir and the king his realm why now is henry king and margaret queen and humphrey duke of gloucester scarce himself that bears so shrewd a maim two pulls at once his lady banished and a limb lopped off this staff of honor raught there let it stand where it best fits to be in henry's hand ay good my lord for purposely therefor left i the court to see this quarrel tried can you not see or will you not observe the strangeness of his altered countenance with what a majesty he bears himself how insolent of late he is become how proud how peremptory and unlike himself we know the time since he was mild and affable and if we did but glance a far off look immediately he was upon his knee that all the court admired him for submission but meet him now and be it in the morn when everyone will give the time of day he knits his brow and shows an angry eye and passeth by with stiff unbow\u00e8d knee disdaining duty that to us belongs small curs are not regarded when they grin but great men tremble when the lion roars  and humphrey is no little man in england first note that he is near you in descent and should you fall he is the next will mount meseemeth then it is no policy respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness' council by flattery hath he won the commons' hearts and when he please to make commotion 'tis to be feared they all will follow him now 'tis the spring and weeds are shallow rooted suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden and choke the herbs for want of husbandry the reverent care i bear unto my lord made me collect these dangers in the duke if it be fond call it a woman's fear which fear if better reasons can supplant i will subscribe and say i wronged the duke my lords of suffolk buckingham and york reprove my allegation if you can or else conclude my words effectual ah what's more dangerous than this fond affiance seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed for he's dispos\u00e8d as the hateful raven is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him for he's inclined as is the ravenous wolves who cannot steal a shape that means deceit take heed my lord the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man but i can give the loser leave to chide what will your highness leave the parliament free lords cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams henry my lord is cold in great affairs too full of foolish pity and gloucester's show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers or as the snake rolled in a flow'ring bank with shining checkered slough doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent believe me lords were none more wise than i  and yet herein i judge mine own wit good  this gloucester should be quickly rid the world to rid us from the fear we have of him so the poor chicken should be sure of death thrice noble suffolk 'tis resolutely spoke and so say i nay then this spark will prove a raging fire if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with  no more good york sweet somerset be still  thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there might happily have proved far worse than his god forbid any malice should prevail that faultless may condemn a nobleman pray god he may acquit him of suspicion marry god forfend how fares my lord help lords the king is dead run go help help o henry ope thine eyes how fares my gracious lord why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus although the duke was enemy to him yet he most christian like laments his death and for myself foe as he was to me might liquid tears or heart offending groans or blood consuming sighs recall his life i would be blind with weeping sick with groans look pale as primrose with blood drinking sighs and all to have the noble duke alive what know i how the world may deem of me for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judged i made the duke away so shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded and princes' courts be filled with my reproach this get i by his death ay me unhappy to be a queen and crowned with infamy be woe for me more wretched than he is what dost thou turn away and hide thy face i am no loathsome leper look on me what art thou like the adder waxen deaf be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen is all thy comfort shut in gloucester's tomb why then dame margaret was ne'er thy joy erect his statue and worship it and make my image but an alehouse sign was i for this nigh wracked upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from england's bank drove back again unto my native clime what boded this but well forewarning wind did seem to say seek not a scorpion's nest nor set no footing on this unkind shore what did i then but cursed the gentle gusts and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards england's bless\u00e8d shore or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock yet aeolus would not be a murderer but left that hateful office unto thee the pretty vaulting sea refused to drown me knowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shore with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cow'red in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides because thy flinty heart more hard than they might in thy palace perish margaret as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs when from thy shore the tempest beat us back i stood upon the hatches in the storm and when the dusky sky began to rob my earnest gaping sight of thy land's view i took a costly jewel from my neck  a heart it was bound in with diamonds  and threw it towards thy land the sea received it and so i wished thy body might my heart and even with this i lost fair england's view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and called them blind and dusky spectacles for losing ken of albion's wish\u00e8d coast how often have i tempted suffolk's tongue the agent of thy foul inconstancy to sit and watch me as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his father's acts commenced in burning troy am i not witched like her or thou not false like him ay me i can no more die margaret for henry weeps that thou dost live so long then you belike suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphrey's timeless death are you the butcher suffolk where's your knife is beaufort termed a kite where are his talons he dares not calm his contumelious spirit nor cease to be an arrogant controller though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times what noise is this o henry let me plead for gentle suffolk mischance and sorrow go along with you heart's discontent and sour affliction be playfellows to keep you company there's two of you the devil make a third and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps fie coward woman and soft hearted wretch hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemies enough sweet suffolk thou torment'st thyself and these dread curses like the sun 'gainst glass or like an over charg\u00e8d gun recoil and turn the force of them upon thyself o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand that i may dew it with my mournful tears nor let the rain of heaven wet this place to wash away my woeful monuments o could this kiss be printed in thy hand that thou mightst think upon these by the seal through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee so get thee gone that i may know my grief 'tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by as one that surfeits thinking on a want i will repeal thee or be well assured adventure to be banish\u00e8d myself and banish\u00e8d i am if but from thee go speak not to me even now be gone o go not yet even thus two friends condemned embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves loather a hundred times to part than die yet now farewell and farewell life with thee whither goes vaux so fast what news i prithee go tell this heavy message to the king ay me what is this world what news are these but wherefore grieve i at an hour's poor loss omitting suffolk's exile my soul's treasure why only suffolk mourn i not for thee and with the southern clouds contend in tears  theirs for the earth's increase mine for my sorrows' now get thee hence the king thou know'st is coming if thou be found by me thou art but dead away though parting be a fretful corrosive it is appli\u00e8d to a deathful wound to france sweet suffolk let me hear from thee for wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe i'll have an iris that shall find thee out and take my heart with thee this way for me oft have i heard that grief softens the mind and makes it fearful and degenerate think therefore on revenge and cease to weep but who can cease to weep and look on this here may his head lie on my throbbing breast but where's the body that i should embrace ah barbarous villains hath this lovely face ruled like a wandering planet over me and could it not enforce them to relent that were unworthy to behold the same no my love i should not mourn but die for thee ah were the duke of suffolk now alive these kentish rebels would be soon appeased my hope is gone now suffolk is deceased for thousand yorks he shall not hide his head but boldly stand and front him to his face call hither clifford bid him come amain to say if that the bastard boys of york shall be the surety for their traitor father and here comes clifford to deny their bail he is arrested but will not obey his sons he says shall give their words for him a subtle traitor needs no sophister away my lord you are slow for shame away what are you made of you'll nor fight nor fly now is it manhood wisdom and defense to give the enemy way and to secure us by what we can which can no more but fly if you be

queen this day here holds her parliament but little thinks we shall be of her council by words or blows here let us win our right then leave me not my lords be resolute i mean to take possession of my right i am thine it was my inheritance as the earldom was it must and shall be so content thyself will you we show our title to the crown if not our swords shall plead it in the field sons peace 'twas by rebellion against his king what then he rose against him being his sovereign and made him to resign his crown perforce why whisper you my lords and answer not henry of lancaster resign thy crown  what mutter you or what conspire you lords confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv'st this oath i willingly take and will perform now york and lancaster are reconciled farewell my gracious lord i'll to my castle why how now sons and brother at a strife what is your quarrel how began it first about what mine boy not till king henry be dead i took an oath that he should quietly reign i shall be if i claim by open war thou canst not son it is impossible richard enough i will be king or die  brother thou shalt to london presently and whet on warwick to this enterprise  thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolk and tell him privily of our intent  you edward shall unto my lord cobham with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise in them i trust for they are soldiers witty courteous liberal full of spirit while you are thus employed what resteth more but that i seek occasion how to rise and yet the king not privy to my drift nor any of the house

followers to the eager foe turn back and fly like ships before the wind or lambs pursued by hunger starv\u00e8d wolves my sons god knows what hath bechanc\u00e8d them but this i know they have demeaned themselves like men borne to renown by life or death three times did richard make a lane to me and thrice cried courage father fight it out and full as oft came edward to my side with purple falchion painted to the hilt in blood of those that had encountered him and when the hardiest warriors did retire richard cried charge and give no foot of ground and cried a crown or else a glorious tomb a scepter or an earthly sepulcher with this we charged again but out alas we budged again as i have seen a swan with bootless labor swim against the tide and spend her strength with over matching

thought o'errun my former time and if thou canst for blushing view this face and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this so triumph thieves upon their conquered booty so true men yield with robbers so o'ermatched she wolf of france but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth how ill beseeming is it in thy sex to triumph like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates but that thy face is vizard like unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay proud queen to make thee blush to tell thee whence thou cam'st of whom derived were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death 'tis beauty that doth oft make women proud but god he knows thy share thereof is small 'tis virtue that doth make them most admired the contrary doth make thee wondered at 'tis government that makes them seem divine the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion o tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide how couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a woman's face women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless bidd'st thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins these tears are my sweet rutland's obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death 'gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoman that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touched would not have stained with blood but you are more inhuman more inexorable o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania see ruthless queen a hapless father's tears this cloth thou dipped'st in blood of my sweet boy and i with tears do wash the blood away keep thou the napkin and go boast of this and if thou tell'st the heavy story right upon my soul the hearers will shed tears yea even my foes will shed fast falling tears and say alas it was a piteous deed there take the crown and with the crown my curse and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand

call the earls of surrey and of warwick but ere they come bid them o'erread these letters and well consider of them make good speed how many thousand of my poorest subjects are at this hour asleep o sleep o gentle sleep nature's soft nurse how have i frighted thee that thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down and steep my senses in forgetfulness why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs upon uneasy pallets stretching thee and hushed with buzzing night flies to thy slumber than in the perfumed chambers of the great under the canopies of costly state and lulled with sound of sweetest melody o thou dull god why liest thou with the vile in loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch a watch case or a common 'larum bell wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast seal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains in cradle of the rude imperious surge and in the visitation of the winds who take the ruffian billows by the top curling their monstrous heads and hanging them with deafing clamor in the slippery clouds that with the hurly death itself awakes canst thou o partial sleep give thy repose to the wet sea boy in an hour so rude and in the calmest and most stillest night with all appliances and means to boot deny it to a king then happy low lie down uneasy lies the head that wears a crown is it good morrow lords why then good morrow to you all my lords have you read o'er the letter that i sent you then you perceive the body of our kingdom how foul it is what rank diseases grow and with what danger near the heart of it o god that one might read the book of fate and see the revolution of the times make mountains level and the continent weary of solid firmness melt itself into the sea and other times to see the beachy girdle of the ocean too wide for neptune's hips how chance's mocks and changes fill the cup of alteration with divers liquors o if this were seen the happiest youth viewing his progress through what perils past what crosses to ensue would shut the book and sit him down and die 'tis not ten years gone since richard and northumberland great friends did feast together and in two years after were they at wars it is but eight years since this percy was the man nearest my soul who like a brother toiled in my affairs and laid his love and life under my foot yea for my sake even to the eyes of richard gave him defiance but which of you was by  you cousin nevil as i may remember  when richard with his eye brimful of tears then checked and rated by northumberland did speak these words now proved a prophecy northumberland thou ladder by the which my cousin bolingbroke ascends my throne  though then god knows i had no such intent but that necessity so bowed the state that i and greatness were compelled to kiss  the time shall come thus did he follow it the time will come that foul sin gathering head shall break into corruption so went on foretelling this same time's condition and the division of our amity are these things then necessities then let us meet them like necessities and that same word even now cries out on us they say the bishop and northumberland are fifty thousand strong i will take your counsel and were these inward wars once out of hand we would dear lords unto the holy land now lords if god doth give successful end to this debate that bleedeth at our doors we will our youth lead on to higher fields and draw no swords but what are sanctified our navy is addressed our power collected our substitutes in absence well invested and everything lies level to our wish only we want a little personal strength and pause us till these rebels now afoot come underneath the yoke of government humphrey my son of gloucester where is the prince your brother and how accompanied is not his brother thomas of clarence with him nothing but well to thee thomas of clarence how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother he loves thee and thou dost neglect him thomas thou hast a better place in his affection than all thy brothers cherish it my boy and noble offices thou mayst effect of mediation after i am dead between his greatness and thy other brethren therefore omit him not blunt not his love nor lose the good advantage of his grace by seeming cold or careless of his will for he is gracious if he be observed he hath a tear for pity and a hand open as day for melting charity yet notwithstanding being incensed he is flint as humorous as winter and as sudden as flaws congeal\u00e8d in the spring of day his temper therefore must be well observed chide him for faults and do it reverently when you perceive his blood inclined to mirth but being moody give him time and scope till that his passions like a whale on ground confound themselves with working learn this thomas and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in that the united vessel of their blood mingled with venom of suggestion as force perforce the age will pour it in shall never leak though it do work as strong as aconitum or rash gunpowder why art thou not at windsor with him thomas and how accompanied canst thou tell that most subject is the fattest soil to weeds and he the noble image of my youth is overspread with them therefore my grief stretches itself beyond the hour of death the blood weeps from my heart when i do shape in forms imaginary th' unguided days and rotten times that you shall look upon when i am sleeping with my ancestors for when his headstrong riot hath no curb when rage and hot blood are his counsellors when means and lavish manners meet together o with what wings shall his affections fly towards fronting peril and opposed decay 'tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb in the dead carrion who's here westmoreland o westmoreland thou art a summer bird which ever in the haunch of winter sings the lifting up of day look here's more news and wherefore should these good news make me sick will fortune never come with both hands full but write her fair words still in foulest letters she either gives a stomach and no food  such are the poor in health or else a feast and takes away the stomach such are the rich that have abundance and enjoy it not i should rejoice now at this happy news and now my sight fails and my brain is giddy o me come near me now i am much ill i pray you take me up and bear me hence into some other chamber softly pray let there be no noise made my gentle friends unless some dull and favorable hand will whisper music to my weary spirit set me the crown upon my pillow here warwick gloucester clarence why did you leave me here alone my lords the prince of wales where is he let me see him he is not here where is the crown who took it from my pillow the prince hath ta'en it hence go seek him out is he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my death find him my lord of warwick chide him hither this part of his conjoins with my disease and helps to end me see sons what things you are how quickly nature falls into revolt when gold becomes her object for this the foolish overcareful fathers have broke their sleep with thoughts their brains with care their bones with industry for this they have engross\u00e8d and piled up the cankered heaps of strange achiev\u00e8d gold for this they have been thoughtful to invest their sons with arts and martial exercises  when like the bee tolling from every flower the virtuous sweets our thighs packed with wax our mouths with honey we bring it to the hive and like the bees are murdered for our pains this bitter taste yields his engrossments to the ending father now where is he that will not stay so long till his friend sickness hath determined me but wherefore did he take away the crown lo where he comes come hither to me harry  depart the chamber leave us here alone thy wish was father harry to that thought i stay too long by thee i weary thee dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair that thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors before thy hour be ripe o foolish youth thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee stay but a little for my cloud of dignity is held from falling with so weak a wind that it will quickly drop my day is dim thou hast stol'n that which after some few hours were thine without offense and at my death thou hast sealed up my expectation thy life did manifest thou loved'st me not and thou wilt have me die assured of it thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts whom thou hast whetted on thy stony heart to stab at half an hour of my life what canst thou not forbear me half an hour then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear that thou art crown\u00e8d not that i am dead let all the tears that should bedew my hearse be drops of balm to sanctify thy head only compound me with forgotten dust give that which gave thee life unto the worms pluck down my officers break my decrees for now a time is come to mock at form harry the fifth is crowned up vanity down royal state all you sage councillors hence and to the english court assemble now from every region apes of idleness now neighbor confines purge you of your scum have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance revel the night rob murder and commit the oldest sins the newest kind of ways be happy he will trouble you no more england shall double gild his treble guilt england shall give him office honor might for the fifth harry from curbed license plucks the muzzle of restraint and the wild dog shall flesh his tooth on every innocent o my poor kingdom sick with civil blows when that my care could not withhold thy riots what wilt thou do when riot is thy care o thou wilt be a wilderness again peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants o my son god put it in thy mind to take it hence that thou mightst win the more thy father's love pleading so wisely in excuse of it come hither harry sit thou by my bed and hear i think the very latest counsel that ever i shall breathe god knows my son by what bypaths and indirect crook'd ways i met this crown and i myself know well how troublesome it sat upon my head to thee it shall descend with better quiet better opinion better confirmation for all the soil of the achievement goes with me into the earth it seemed in me but as an honor snatched with boist'rous hand and i had many living to upbraid my gain of it by their assistances which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed wounding suppos\u00e8d peace all these bold fears thou seest with peril i have answer\u00e8d for all my reign hath been but as a scene acting that argument and now my death changes the mood for what in me was purchased falls upon thee in a more fairer sort so thou the garland wear'st successively yet though thou stand'st more sure than i could do thou art not firm enough since griefs are green and all my friends which thou must make thy friends have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out by whose fell working i was first advanced and by whose power i well might lodge a fear to be again displaced which to avoid i cut them off and had a purpose now to lead out many to the holy land lest rest and lying still might make them look too near unto my state therefore my harry be it thy course to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels that action hence borne out may waste the memory of the former days more would i but my lungs are wasted so that strength of speech is utterly denied me how i came by the crown o god forgive and grant it may with thee in true peace live look look here comes my john of lancaster thou bring'st me happiness and peace son john but health alack with youthful wings is flown from this bare withered trunk upon thy sight my worldly business makes a period where is my lord of warwick doth any name particular belong unto the lodging where i first did swoon laud be to god even there my life must end it hath been prophesied to me many years i should not die but in jerusalem which vainly i

none but thee for i do hate thee worse than a promise breaker let the first budger die the other's slave and the gods doom him after within these three hours tullus alone i fought in your corioles'

some wounds upon me and they smart to hear themselves remembered i thank you general but cannot make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it and stand upon my common part with those that have beheld the doing may these same instruments which you profane never sound more when drums and trumpets shall i' th' field prove flatterers let courts and cities be made all of false faced soothing when steel grows soft as the parasite's silk let him be made an ovator for th' wars no more i say for that i have not washed my nose that bled or foiled some debile wretch which without note here's many else have done you shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical as if i loved my little should be dieted in praises sauced with lies i will go wash and when my face is fair you shall perceive whether i blush or no howbeit i thank you i mean to stride your steed and at all times to undercrest your good addition to th' fairness of my power the gods begin to mock me i that now refused most princely gifts am bound to beg of my lord general i sometime lay here in corioles at a poor man's house he used me kindly he cried to me i saw him prisoner but then aufidius was within my view and wrath o'erwhelmed my pity i request you to give my poor host freedom by jupiter forgot i am weary yea my memory is tired have we no wine here no more of this it does offend my heart pray now no more o you have i know petitioned all the gods for my prosperity my gracious silence hail wouldst thou have laughed had i come coffined home that weep'st to see me triumph ah my dear such eyes the widows in corioles wear and mothers that lack sons and live you yet o my sweet lady pardon menenius ever ever your hand and yours ere in our own house i do shade my head the good patricians must be visited from whom i have received not only greetings but with them change of honors know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs your honors pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them no sir yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words you soothed not therefore hurt not but your people i love them as they weigh i had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered i do owe them still my life and services i do beseech you let me o'erleap that custom for i cannot put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing it is a part that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people to brag unto them thus i did and thus show them th' unaching scars which i should hide as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only what must i say i pray sir plague upon 't i cannot bring my tongue to such a pace look sir my wounds i got them in my country's service when some certain of your brethren roared and ran from th' noise of our own drums think upon me hang 'em i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by 'em bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean so here comes a brace  you know the cause sir of my standing here mine own desert ay but not mine own desire no sir 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging well then i pray your price o' th' consulship kindly sir i pray let me ha 't i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir what say you a match sir there's in all two worthy voices begged i have your alms adieu pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown your enigma you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love i will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them 'tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practice the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you i may be consul i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther most sweet voices better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve why in this woolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that does appear their needless vouches custom calls me to 't what custom wills in all things should we do 't the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heaped for truth to o'erpeer rather than fool it so let the high office and the honor go to one that would do thus i am half through the one part suffered the other will i do here come more voices  your voices for your voices i have fought watched for your voices for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six i have seen and heard of for your voices have done many things some less some more your voices indeed i would be consul worthy voices is this done where at the senate house may i change these garments that i'll straight do and knowing myself again repair to th' senate house tullus aufidius then had made new head so then the volsces stand but as at first ready when time shall prompt them to make road upon 's again saw you aufidius spoke he of me how what at antium lives he i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully welcome home behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues o' th' common mouth i do despise them for they do prank them in authority against all noble sufferance ha what is that what makes this change have i had children's voices are these your herd must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues what are your offices you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth have you not set them on it is a purposed thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility suffer 't and live with such as cannot rule nor ever will be ruled why this was known before have you informed them sithence why then should i be consul by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune tell me of corn this was my speech and i will speak 't again now as i live i will my nobler friends i crave their pardons for the mutable rank scented meiny let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves i say again in soothing them we nourish 'gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have plowed for sowed and scattered by mingling them with us the honored number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars how no more as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tetter us yet sought the very way to catch them choler were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove 'twould be my mind shall remain hear you this triton of the minnows mark you his absolute shall shall o good but most unwise patricians why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer that with his peremptory shall being but the horn and noise o' th' monster's wants not spirit to say he'll turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity if you are learned be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the great'st taste most palates theirs they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his shall his popular shall against a graver bench than ever frowned in greece by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter 'twixt the gap of both and take the one by th' other whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o' th' storehouse gratis as 'twas used sometime in greece  though there the people had more absolute power i say they nourished disobedience fed the ruin of the state i'll give my reasons more worthier than their voices they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assured they ne'er did service for 't being pressed to th' war even when the navel of the state was touched they would not thread the gates this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis being i' th' war their mutinies and revolts wherein they showed most valor spoke not for them th' accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the native of our so frank donation well what then how shall this bosom multiplied digest the senate's courtesy let deeds express what's like to be their words we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o' th' senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles no take more what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal this double worship  where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason

at the price of one fair word nor check my courage for what they can give to have 't with saying good morrow you common cry of curs whose breath i hate as reek o' th' rotten fens whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air i banish you and here remain with your uncertainty let every feeble rumor shake your hearts your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair have the power still to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance which finds not till it feels making but reservation of yourselves still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows despising for you the city thus i turn my back there is a world elsewhere come leave your tears a brief farewell the beast with many heads

hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief thereto witness may my surname coriolanus the painful service the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname a good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains the cruelty and envy of the people permitted by our dastard nobles who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest and suffered me by th' voice of slaves to be whooped out of rome now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope  mistake me not to save my life for if i had feared death of all the men i' th' world i would have 'voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here

and theseus' love theirs has more ground is more maturely seasoned more buckled with strong judgment and their needs the one of th' other may be said to water their intertangled roots of love but i and she i sigh and spoke of were things innocent loved for we did and like the elements that know not what nor why yet do effect rare issues by their operance our souls did so to one another what she liked was then of me approved what not condemned no more arraignment the flower that i would pluck and put between my breasts o then but beginning to swell about the blossom she would long till she had such another and commit it to the like innocent cradle where phoenix like they died in perfume on my head no toy but was her pattern her affections pretty though haply hers careless were i followed for my most serious decking had mine ear stol'n some new air or at adventure hummed one from musical coinage why it was a note whereon her spirits would sojourn rather dwell on  and sing it in her slumbers this rehearsal  which fury innocent wots well comes in like old importment's bastard has this end that the true love 'tween maid and maid may be more than in sex individual i am sure i shall not i am not against your faith yet i continue mine this garden has a world of pleasures in 't what flower is this that was a fair boy certain but a fool to love himself were there not maids enough or were they all hard hearted thou wouldst not that's a good wench but take heed to your kindness though men are mad things canst not thou work such flowers in silk wench i'll have a gown full of 'em and of these this is pretty color will 't not do rarely upon a skirt wench of all flowers methinks a rose is best it is the very emblem of a maid for when the west wind courts her gently how modestly she blows and paints the sun with her chaste blushes when the north comes near her rude and impatient then like chastity she locks her beauties in her bud again and leaves him to base briers thou art wanton the sun grows high let's walk in keep these flowers we'll see how near art can come near their colors i am wondrous merry hearted i could laugh now and take one with you well agree

tie you to your word now if you fail in 't think how you maim your honor  for now i am set a begging sir i am deaf to all but your compassion how their lives might breed the ruin of my name opinion shall anything that loves me perish for me that were a cruel wisdom do men prune the straight young boughs that blush with thousand blossoms because they may be rotten o duke theseus the goodly mothers that have groaned for these and all the longing maids that ever loved if your vow stand shall curse me and my beauty and in their funeral songs for these two cousins despise my cruelty and cry woe worth me till i am nothing but the scorn of women for heaven's sake save their lives and banish 'em swear 'em never more to make me their contention or to know me to tread upon thy dukedom and to be wherever they shall travel ever strangers to one another i cannot sir they are both too excellent for me a hair shall never fall of these men yes i must sir else both miscarry yet i may bind those wounds up that must open and bleed to death for my sake else i'll choose and end their strife two such young handsome men shall never fall for me their weeping mothers following the dead cold ashes of their sons shall never curse my cruelty good heaven what a sweet face has arcite if wise nature with all her best endowments all those beauties she sows into the births of noble bodies were here a mortal woman and had in her the coy denials of young maids yet doubtless she would run mad for this man what an eye of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness has this young prince here love himself sits smiling just such another wanton ganymede set jove afire with and enforced the god snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him a shining constellation what a brow of what a spacious majesty he carries arched like the great eyed juno's but far sweeter smoother than pelops' shoulder fame and honor methinks from hence as from a promontory pointed in heaven should clap their wings and sing to all the under world the loves and fights of gods and such men near 'em palamon is but his foil to him a mere dull shadow he's swart and meager of an eye as heavy as if he had lost his mother a still temper no stirring in him no alacrity of all this sprightly sharpness not a smile yet these that we count errors may become him narcissus was a sad boy but a heavenly o who can find the bent of woman's fancy i am a fool my reason is lost in me i have no choice and i have lied so lewdly that women ought to beat me on my knees i ask thy pardon palamon thou art alone and only beautiful and these the eyes these the bright lamps of beauty that command and threaten love and what young maid dare cross 'em what a bold gravity and yet inviting has this brown manly face o love this only from this hour is complexion lie there arcite thou art a changeling to him a mere gypsy and this the noble body i am sotted utterly lost my virgin's faith has fled me for if my brother but even now had asked me whether i loved i had run mad for arcite now if my sister more for palamon stand both together now come ask me brother alas i know not ask me now sweet sister i may go look what a mere child is fancy that having two fair gauds of equal sweetness cannot distinguish but must cry for both how now sir to end the quarrel would i might end first what sins have i committed chaste diana that my unspotted youth must now be soiled with blood of princes and my chastity be made the altar where the lives of lovers  two greater and two better never yet made mothers joy must be the sacrifice to my unhappy beauty i had rather both so neither for my sake should fall untimely must these men die too poor wench go weep for whosoever wins loses a noble cousin for thy sins o sacred shadowy cold and constant queen abandoner of revels mute contemplative sweet solitary white as chaste and pure as wind fanned snow who to thy female knights allow'st no more blood than will make a blush which is their order's robe i here thy priest am humbled 'fore thine altar o vouchsafe with that thy rare green eye which never yet beheld thing maculate look on thy virgin and sacred silver mistress lend thine ear  which ne'er heard scurrile term into whose port ne'er entered wanton sound to my petition seasoned with holy fear this is my last of vestal office i am bride habited but maiden hearted a husband i have 'pointed but do not know him out of two i should choose one and pray for his success but i am guiltless of election of mine eyes were i to lose one they are equal precious  i could doom neither that which perished should go to 't unsentenced therefore most modest queen he of the two pretenders that best loves me and has the truest title in 't let him take off my wheaten garland or else grant the file and quality i hold i may continue in thy band see what our general of ebbs and flows out from the bowels of her holy altar with sacred act advances but one rose if well inspired this battle shall confound both these brave knights and i a virgin flower must grow alone unplucked the flower is fall'n the tree descends o mistress thou here dischargest me i shall be gathered i think so but i know not thine own will unclasp thy mystery i hope she's pleased her signs were gracious i'll no step further i had rather see a wren hawk at a fly than this decision ev'ry blow that falls threats a brave life each stroke laments the place whereon it falls and sounds more like a bell than blade i will stay here it is enough my hearing shall be punished with what shall happen 'gainst the which there is no deafing but to hear not taint mine eye with dread sights it may shun pardon me if i were there i'd wink i am extinct there is but envy in that light which shows the one the other darkness which ever was the dam of horror who does stand accursed of many mortal millions may even now by casting her black mantle over both that neither could find other get herself some part of a good name and many a murder set off whereto she's guilty in faith i will not sir pardon me the title of a kingdom may be tried out of itself arcite is gently visaged yet his eye is like an engine bent or a sharp weapon in a soft sheath mercy and manly courage are bedfellows in his visage palamon has a most menacing aspect his brow is graved and seems to bury what it frowns on yet sometimes 'tis not so but alters to the quality of his thoughts long time his eye will dwell upon his object melancholy becomes him nobly so does arcite's mirth but palamon's sadness is a kind of mirth so mingled as if mirth did make him sad and sadness merry those darker humors that stick misbecomingly on others on them live in fair dwelling hark how yon spurs to spirit do incite the princes to their proof arcite may win me and yet may palamon wound arcite to the spoiling of his figure o what pity enough for such a chance if i were by i might do hurt for they would glance their eyes towards my seat and in that motion might omit a ward or forfeit an offense which craved that very time it is much better i am not there o better never born than minister to such harm what is the chance then he has won 'twas ever likely he looked all grace and success and he is doubtless the prim'st of men i prithee run and tell me how it goes run and inquire poor servant thou hast lost upon my right side still i wore thy picture palamon's on the left why so i know not i had no end in 't else chance would have it so on the sinister side the heart lies palamon had the best boding chance this burst of clamor is sure th' end o' th' combat were they metamorphosed both into one o why there were no woman worth so composed a man their single share their nobleness peculiar to them gives the prejudice of disparity value's shortness to any lady breathing more exulting palamon still i prithee lay attention to the cry set both thine ears to th' business half sights saw that arcite was no babe god's lid his richness and costliness of spirit looked through him it could no more be hid in him than fire in flax than humble banks can go to law with waters that drift winds force to raging i did think good palamon would miscarry yet i knew not why i did think so our reasons are not prophets when oft our fancies are they are coming off alas poor palamon is this winning o all you heavenly powers where is your mercy but that your wills have said it must be so and charge me live to comfort this unfriended this miserable prince that cuts away a life more worthy from him than all women i should and would die too i'll close thine eyes prince blessed souls be with thee thou art a right good man and while i live this day i give to tears", "Tro_Pandarus": "will this gear ne'er be mended well i have told you enough of

reverend sir into our kingdom use us and it my good lord have great care i be not found a talker we are busy go and once more in mine arms i bid him welcome and thank the holy conclave for their loves

does best god forbid else cardinal prithee call gardiner to me my new secretary i find him a fit fellow come hither gardiner deliver this with modesty to th' queen the most convenient place that i can think of for such receipt of learning is blackfriars there you shall meet about this weighty business my wolsey see it furnished o my lord would it not grieve an able man to leave so sweet a bedfellow

she has carried herself towards me my lord cardinal i do excuse you yea upon mine honor i free you from 't you are not to be taught that you have many enemies that know not why they are so but like to village curs bark when their fellows do by some of these the queen is put in anger you're excused but will you be more justified you ever have wished the sleeping of this business never desired it to be stirred but oft have hindered oft the passages made toward it on my honor i speak my good lord cardinal to this point and thus far clear him now what moved me to 't i will be bold with time and your attention then mark th' inducement thus it came give heed to 't my conscience first received a tenderness scruple and prick on certain speeches uttered by th' bishop of bayonne then french ambassador who had been hither sent on the debating a marriage 'twixt the duke of orleans and our daughter mary i' th' progress of this business ere a determinate resolution he i mean the bishop did require a respite wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate respecting this our marriage with the dowager sometime our brother's wife this respite shook the bosom of my conscience entered me yea with a spitting power and made to tremble the region of my breast which forced such way that many mazed considerings did throng and pressed in with this caution first methought i stood not in the smile of heaven who had commanded nature that my lady's womb if it conceived a male child by me should do no more offices of life to 't than the grave does to th' dead for her male issue or died where they were made or shortly after this world had aired them hence i took a thought this was a judgment on me that my kingdom well worthy the best heir o' th' world should not be gladded in 't by me then follows that i weighed the danger which my realms stood in by this my issue's fail and that gave to me many a groaning throe thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience i did steer toward this remedy whereupon we are now present here together that's to say i meant to rectify my conscience which i then did feel full sick and yet not well by all the reverend fathers of the land and doctors learn\u00e8d first i began in private with you my lord of lincoln you remember how under my oppression i did reek when i first moved you i have spoke long be pleased yourself to say how far you satisfied me i then moved you my lord of canterbury and got your leave to make this present summons unsolicited i left no reverend person in this court but by particular consent proceeded under your hands and seals therefore go on for no dislike i' th' world against the person of the good queen but the sharp thorny points of my alleg\u00e8d reasons drives this forward prove but our marriage lawful by my life and kingly dignity we are contented to wear our mortal state to come with her katherine our queen before the primest creature that's paragoned o' th' world i may perceive these cardinals trifle with me i abhor this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome my learn\u00e8d and well belov\u00e8d servant cranmer prithee return with thy approach i know my comfort comes along break up the court i say set on what piles of wealth hath he accumulated to his own portion and what expense by th' hour seems to flow from him how i' th' name of thrift does he rake this together now my lords saw you the cardinal it may well be there is a mutiny in 's mind this morning papers of state he sent me to peruse as i required and wot you what i found there on my conscience put unwittingly  forsooth an inventory thus importing the several parcels of his plate his treasure rich stuffs and ornaments of household which i find at such proud rate that it outspeaks possession of a subject if we did think his contemplation were above the earth and fixed on spiritual object he should still dwell in his musings but i am afraid his thinkings are below the moon not worth his serious considering good my lord you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory of your best graces in your mind the which you were now running o'er you have scarce time to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span to keep your earthly audit sure in that i deem you an ill husband and am glad to have you therein my companion you have said well 'tis well said again and 'tis a kind of good deed

true and if you may confess it say withal if you are bound to us or no what say you fairly answered a loyal and obedient subject is therein illustrated the honor of it does pay the act of it as i' th' contrary the foulness is the punishment i presume that as my hand has opened bounty to you my heart dropped love my power rained honor more on you than any so your hand and heart your brain and every function of your power should notwithstanding that your bond of duty as 'twere in love's particular be more to me your friend than any 'tis nobly spoken  take notice lords he has a loyal breast for

army broken and but the backs of britons seen all flying through a strait lane the enemy full hearted lolling the tongue with slaught'ring having work more plentiful than tools to do 't struck down some mortally some slightly touched some falling merely through fear that the strait pass was dammed with dead men hurt behind and cowards living to die with lengthened shame close by the battle ditched and walled with turf which gave advantage to an ancient soldier an honest one i warrant who deserved so long a breeding as his white beard came to in doing this for 's country athwart the lane he with two striplings lads more like to run the country base than to commit such slaughter with faces fit for masks or rather fairer than those for preservation cased or shame  made good the passage cried to those that fled our britain's harts die flying not our men to darkness fleet souls that fly backwards stand or we are romans and will give you that like beasts which you shun beastly and may

hides him in fresh cups soft beds sweet words or hath more ministers than we that draw his knives i' th' war well i will find him for being now a favorer to the briton no more a britoni have resumed again the part i came in fight i will no more but yield me to the veriest hind that shall once touch my shoulder great the slaughter is here made by th' roman great the answer be britons must take for me my ransom's death on either side i come to spend my breath which neither here i'll keep nor bear again but end it by some means for imogen a roman who had not now been drooping here if seconds had answered him most welcome bondage for thou art a way i think to liberty yet am i better than one that's sick o' th' gout since he had rather groan so in perpetuity than be cured by th' sure physician death who is the key t' unbar these locks my conscience thou art fettered more than my shanks and wrists you good gods give me the penitent instrument to pick that bolt then free forever is 't enough i am sorry so children temporal fathers do appease gods are more full of mercy must i repent i cannot do it better than in gyves desired more than constrained to satisfy if of my freedom 'tis the main part take no stricter render of me than my all i know you are more clement than vile men who of their broken debtors take a third a sixth a tenth letting them thrive again on their abatement that's not my desire for imogen's dear life take mine and though 'tis not so dear yet 'tis a life you coined it 'tween man and man they weigh not every stamp though light take pieces for the figure's sake you rather mine being yours and so great powers if you will take this audit take this life and cancel these cold bonds o imogen i'll speak to thee in silence sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot a father to me and thou hast created a mother and two brothers but o scorn gone they went hence so soon as they were born and so i am awake poor wretches that depend on greatness' favor dream as i have done wake and find nothing but alas i swerve many dream not to find neither deserve and yet are steeped in favors so am i that have this golden chance and know not why what fairies haunt this

the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof while all is shared and all is borne away ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue while his own lands are bargained for and sold methinks the realms of england france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burnt unto the prince's heart of calydon anjou and maine both given unto the french cold news for me for i had hope of france even as i have of fertile england's soil a day will come when york shall claim his own and therefore i will take the nevilles' parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey and when i spy advantage claim the crown for that's the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right nor hold the scepter in his childish fist nor wear the diadem upon his head whose churchlike humors fits not for a crown then york be still awhile till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep to pry into the secrets of the state till henry surfeiting in joys of love with his new bride and england's dear bought queen and humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars then will i raise aloft the milk white rose with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed and in my standard bear the arms of york to grapple with the house of lancaster and force perforce i'll make him yield the crown whose bookish rule hath pulled fair england down if york have ill demeaned himself in france then let him be denied the regentship i'll tell thee suffolk why i am unmeet first for i cannot flatter thee in pride next if i be appointed for the place my lord of somerset will keep me here without discharge money or furniture till france be won into the dauphin's hands last time i danced attendance on his will till paris was besieged famished and lost doth anyone accuse york for a traitor base dunghill villain and mechanical i'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech  i do beseech your royal majesty let him have all the rigor of the law lay hands upon these traitors and their trash beldam i think we watched you at an inch what madam are you there the king and commonweal are deeply indebted for this piece of pains my lord protector will i doubt it not see you well guerdoned for these good deserts lord buckingham methinks you watched her well a pretty plot well chosen to build upon now pray my lord let's see the devil's writ what have we here the duke yet lives that henry shall depose but him outlive and die a violent death why this is just aio te aeacida romanos vincere posse well to the rest tell me what fate awaits the duke of suffolk by water shall he die and take his end what shall betide the duke of somerset let him shun castles safer shall he be upon the sandy plains than where castles mounted stand come come my lord these oracles are hardly attained and hardly understood the king is now in progress towards saint albans with him the husband of this lovely lady thither goes these news as fast as horse can carry them  a sorry breakfast for my lord protector at your pleasure my good lord who's within there ho invite my lords of salisbury and warwick to sup with me tomorrow night away now my good lords of salisbury and warwick our simple supper ended give me leave in this close walk to satisfy myself in craving your opinion of my title which is infallible to england's crown then thus edward the third my lords had seven sons the first edward the black prince prince of wales the second william of hatfield and the third lionel duke of clarence next to whom was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster the fifth was edmund langley duke of york the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester william of windsor was the seventh and last edward the black prince died before his father and left behind him richard his only son who after edward the third's death reigned as king till henry bolingbroke duke of lancaster the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt crowned by the name of henry the fourth seized on the realm deposed the rightful king sent his poor queen to france from whence she came and him to pomfret where as all you know harmless richard was murdered traitorously which now they hold by force and not by right for richard the first son's heir being dead the issue of the next son should have reigned the third son duke of clarence from whose line i claim the crown had issue philippa a daughter who married edmund mortimer earl of march edmund had issue roger earl of march roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor his eldest sister anne my mother being heir unto the crown married richard earl of cambridge who was son to edmund langley edward the third's fifth son by her i claim the kingdom she was heir to roger earl of march who was the son of edmund mortimer who married philippa sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence so if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger i am king we thank you lords but i am not your king till i be crowned and that my sword be stained with heart blood of the house of lancaster and that's not suddenly to be performed but with advice and silent secrecy do you as i do in these dangerous days wink at the duke of suffolk's insolence at beaufort's pride at somerset's ambition at buckingham and all the crew of them till they have snared the shepherd of the flock that virtuous prince the good duke humphrey 'tis that they seek and they in seeking that shall find their deaths if york can prophesy and neville this i do assure myself richard shall live to make the earl of warwick the greatest man in england but the king lords let him go please it your majesty this is the day appointed for the combat and ready are the appellant and defendant  the armorer and his man to enter the lists so please your highness to behold the fight i never saw a fellow worse bestead or more afraid to fight than is the appellant the servant of this armorer my lords dispatch this knave's tongue begins to double sound trumpets alarum to the combatants take away his weapon fellow thank god and the good wine in thy master's way and did he not in his protectorship levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers' pay in france and never sent it by means whereof the towns each day revolted cold news for me for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud and caterpillars eat my leaves away but i will remedy this gear ere long or sell my title for a glorious grave 'tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france and being protector stayed the soldiers' pay by means whereof his highness hath lost france in your protectorship you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of that england was defamed by tyranny so that by this you would not have him die 'tis york that hath more reason for his death but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk say as you think and speak it from your souls were 't not all one an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite as place duke humphrey for the king's protector and i and now we three have spoke it it skills not greatly who impugns our doom that somerset be sent as regent thither 'tis meet that lucky ruler be employed  witness the fortune he hath had in france no not to lose it all as thou hast done i rather would have lost my life betimes than bring a burden of dishonor home by staying there so long till all were lost show me one scar charactered on thy skin men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win what worse than naught nay then a shame take all i will my lord so please his majesty i am content provide me soldiers lords whiles i take order for mine own affairs my lord of suffolk within fourteen days at bristow i expect my soldiers for there i'll ship them all for ireland now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution be that thou hop'st to be or what thou art resign to death it is not worth th' enjoying let pale faced fear keep with the mean born man and find no harbor in a royal heart faster than springtime showers comes thought on thought and not a thought but thinks on dignity my brain more busy than the laboring spider weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies well nobles well 'tis politicly done to send me packing with an host of men i fear me you but warm the starv\u00e8d snake who cherished in your breasts will sting your hearts 'twas men i lacked and you will give them me i take it kindly yet be well assured you put sharp weapons in a madman's hands whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band i will stir up in england some black storm shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage until the golden circuit on my head like to the glorious sun's transparent beams do calm the fury of this mad bred flaw and for a minister of my intent i have seduced a headstrong kentishman john cade of ashford to make commotion as full well he can under the title of john mortimer in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade oppose himself against a troop of kerns and fought so long till that his thighs with darts were almost like a sharp quilled porpentine and in the end being rescued i have seen him caper upright like a wild morisco shaking the bloody darts as he his bells full often like a shag haired crafty kern hath he convers\u00e8d with the enemy and undiscovered come to me again and given me notice of their villainies this devil here shall be my substitute for that john mortimer which now is dead in face in gait in speech he doth resemble by this i shall perceive the commons' mind how they affect the house and claim of york say he be taken racked and tortur\u00e8d i know no pain they can inflict upon him will make him say i moved him to those arms say that he thrive as 'tis great like he will why then from ireland come i with my strength and reap the harvest which that rascal sowed for humphrey being dead as he shall be and henry put apart the next for me from ireland thus comes york to claim his right and pluck the crown from feeble henry's head ring bells aloud burn bonfires clear and bright to entertain great england's lawful king ah sancta maiestas who would not buy thee dear let them obey that knows not how to rule this hand was made to handle naught but gold i cannot give due action to my words except a sword or scepter balance it a scepter shall it have have i a soul on which i'll toss the fleur de luce of france whom have we here buckingham to disturb me the king hath sent him sure i must dissemble humphrey of buckingham i accept thy greeting art thou a messenger or come of pleasure scarce can i speak my choler is so great o i could hew up rocks and fight with flint i am so angry at these abject terms and now like ajax telamonius on sheep or oxen could i spend my fury i am far better born than is the king more like a king more kingly in my thoughts but i must make fair weather yet awhile till henry be more weak and i more strong  buckingham i prithee pardon me that i have given no answer all this while my mind was troubled with deep melancholy the cause why i have brought this army hither is to remove proud somerset from the king seditious to his grace and to the state upon thine honor is he prisoner then buckingham i do dismiss my powers  soldiers i thank you all disperse yourselves meet me tomorrow in saint george's field you shall have pay and everything you wish and let my sovereign virtuous henry command my eldest son nay all my sons as pledges of my fealty and love i'll send them all as willing as i live lands goods horse armor anything i have is his to use so somerset may die in all submission and humility york doth present himself unto your highness to heave the traitor somerset from hence and fight against that monstrous rebel cade who since i heard to be discomfited how now is somerset at liberty then york unloose thy long imprisoned thoughts and let thy tongue be equal with thy heart shall i endure the sight of somerset  false king why hast thou broken faith with me knowing how hardly i can brook abuse king did i call thee no thou art not king not fit to govern and rule multitudes which dar'st not no nor canst not rule a traitor that head of thine doth not become a crown thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff and not to grace an awful princely scepter that gold must round engirt these brows of mine whose smile and frown like to achilles' spear is able with the change to kill and cure here is a hand to hold a scepter up and with the same to act controlling laws give place by heaven thou shalt rule no

with such weeds as may beseem some well reputed page no girl i'll knit it up in silken strings with twenty odd conceited true love knots to be fantastic may become a youth of greater time than i shall

lov'st me let me have what thou think'st meet and is most mannerly but tell me wench how will the world repute me for undertaking so unstaid a journey i fear me it will make me scandalized nay that i will not that is the least lucetta of my fear a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears and instances of infinite of love warrant me welcome to my proteus base men that use them to so base effect but truer stars did govern proteus' birth his words are bonds his oaths are oracles his love sincere his thoughts immaculate his tears pure messengers sent from his heart his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth now as thou lov'st me do him not that wrong to bear a hard opinion of his truth only deserve my love by loving him and presently go with me to my chamber to take a note of what i stand in need of to furnish me upon my longing journey all that is mine i leave at thy dispose my goods my lands my reputation only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence come answer not but to it presently i am impatient of my tarriance marry mine host because i cannot be merry but shall i hear him speak that will be music is he among these you mistake the musician likes me not he plays false father not so but yet so false that he grieves my very heart strings ay i would i were deaf it makes me have a slow heart not a whit when it jars so ay that change is the spite i would always have one play but one thing but host doth this sir proteus that we talk on often resort unto this gentlewoman where is lance peace stand aside the company parts 'twere false if i should speak it for i am sure she is not buri\u00e8d he heard not that if 'twere a substance you would sure deceive it and make it but a shadow as i am host will you go pray you where lies sir proteus not so but it hath been the longest night that e'er i watched and the most heaviest in what you please i'll do what i can it seems you loved not her to leave her token she is dead belike alas i cannot choose but pity her because methinks that she loved you as well as you do love your lady sylvia she dreams on him that has forgot her love you dote on her that cares not for your love 'tis pity love should be so contrary and thinking on it makes me cry alas how many women would do such a message alas poor proteus thou hast entertained a fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs alas poor fool why do i pity him that with his very heart despiseth me because he loves her he despiseth me because i love him i must pity him this ring i gave him when he parted from me to bind him to remember my good will and now am i unhappy messenger to plead for that which i would not obtain to carry that which i would have refused to praise his faith which i would have dispraised i am my master's true confirm\u00e8d love but cannot be true servant to my master unless i prove false traitor to myself yet will i woo for him but yet so coldly as heaven it knows i would not have him speed gentlewoman good day i pray you be my mean to bring me where to speak with madam sylvia if you be she i do entreat your patience to hear me speak the message i am sent on from my master sir proteus madam ay madam madam please you peruse this letter pardon me madam i have unadvised delivered you a paper that i should not this is the letter to your ladyship it may not be good madam pardon me madam he sends your ladyship this ring she thanks you i thank you madam that you tender her poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much almost as well as i do know myself to think upon her woes i do protest that i have wept a hundred several times i think she doth and that's her cause of sorrow she hath been fairer madam than she is when she did think my master loved her well she in my judgment was as fair as you but since she did neglect her looking glass and threw her sun expelling mask away the air hath starved the roses in her cheeks and pinched the lily tincture of her face that now she is become as black as i about my stature for at pentecost when all our pageants of delight were played our youth got me to play the woman's part and i was trimmed in madam julia's gown which served me as fit by all men's judgments as if the garment had been made for me therefore i know she is about my height and at that time i made her weep agood for i did play a lamentable part madam 'twas ariadne passioning for theseus' perjury and unjust flight which i so lively acted with my tears that my poor mistress mov\u00e8d therewithal wept bitterly and would i might be dead if i in thought felt not her very sorrow and she shall thank you for 't if e'er you know her a virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful i hope my master's suit will be but cold since she respects my mistress' love so much  alas how love can trifle with itself here is her picture let me see i think if i had such a tire this face of mine were full as lovely as is this of hers and yet the painter flattered her a little unless i flatter with myself too much her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow if that be all the difference in his love i'll get me such a colored periwig her eyes are gray as glass and so are mine ay but her forehead's low and mine's as high what should it be that he respects in her but i can make respective in myself if this fond love were not a blinded god come shadow come and take this shadow up for 'tis thy rival o thou senseless form thou shalt be worshipped kissed loved and adored and were there sense in his idolatry my substance should be statue in thy stead i'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake that used me so or else by jove i vow i should have scratched out your unseeing eyes to make my master out of love with thee but love will not be spurred to what it loathes 'tis true such pearls as put out ladies' eyes for i had rather wink than look on them but better indeed when you hold your peace she needs not when she knows it cowardice true from a gentleman to a fool that such an ass should owe them here comes the duke and i will follow more to cross that love than hate for sylvia that is gone for love and me when he approacheth to your presence o me unhappy o good sir my master charged me to deliver a ring to madam sylvia which out of my neglect was never done here 'tis this is it o cry you mercy sir i have mistook this is the ring you sent to sylvia and julia herself did give it me and julia herself hath brought it hither behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths and entertained 'em deeply in her heart how oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root o proteus let this habit make thee blush be thou ashamed that i have took upon me such an immodest raiment if shame live in a disguise of love it is the lesser blot modesty finds women to change their shapes than men their minds and i mine",

they are from home but tell the dauphin i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france for that i have laid by my majesty and plodded like a man for working days but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turned his balls to gun stones and his soul shall stand sore charg\u00e8d for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands mock mothers from their sons mock castles down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphin's scorn but this lies all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a well hallowed cause so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savor but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it  convey them with safe conduct fare you well we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furth'rance to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business therefore let our proportions for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings for god before we'll chide this dauphin at his father's door therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought now sits the wind fair and we will aboard  my lord of cambridge and my kind lord of masham and you my gentle knight give me your thoughts think you not that the powers we bear with us will cut their passage through the force of france doing the execution and the act for which we have in head assembled them i doubt not that since we are well persuaded we carry not a heart with us from hence that grows not in a fair consent with ours nor leave not one behind that doth not wish success and conquest to attend on us we therefore have great cause of thankfulness and shall forget the office of our hand sooner than quittance of desert and merit according to the weight and worthiness we judge no less uncle of exeter enlarge the man committed yesterday that railed against our person we consider it was excess of wine that set him on and on his more advice we pardon him o let us yet be merciful alas your too much love and care of me are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch if little faults proceeding on distemper shall not be winked at how shall we stretch our eye when capital crimes chewed swallowed and digested appear before us we'll yet enlarge that man though cambridge scroop and grey in their dear care and tender preservation of our person would have him punished and now to our french causes who are the late commissioners then richard earl of cambridge there is yours  there yours lord scroop of masham and sir knight grey of northumberland this same is yours  read them and know i know your worthiness  my lord of westmoreland and uncle exeter we will aboard tonight why how now gentlemen what see you in those papers that you lose so much complexion look you how they change their cheeks are paper why what read you there that have so cowarded and chased your blood out of appearance the mercy that was quick in us but late by your own counsel is suppressed and killed you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy for your own reasons turn into your bosoms as dogs upon their masters worrying you  see you my princes and my noble peers these english monsters my lord of cambridge here you know how apt our love was to accord to furnish him with all appurtenants belonging to his honor and this man hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired and sworn unto the practices of france to kill us here in hampton to the which this knight no less for bounty bound to us than cambridge is hath likewise sworn but o what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel ingrateful savage and inhuman creature thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels that knew'st the very bottom of my soul that almost mightst have coined me into gold wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use  may it be possible that foreign hire could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger 'tis so strange that though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white my eye will scarcely see it treason and murder ever kept together as two yoke devils sworn to either's purpose working so grossly in a natural cause that admiration did not whoop at them but thou 'gainst all proportion didst bring in wonder to wait on treason and on murder and whatsoever cunning fiend it was that wrought upon thee so preposterously hath got the voice in hell for excellence all other devils that suggest by treasons do botch and bungle up damnation with patches colors and with forms being fetched from glist'ring semblances of piety but he that tempered thee bade thee stand up gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason unless to dub thee with the name of traitor if that same demon that hath gulled thee thus should with his lion gait walk the whole world he might return to vasty tartar back and tell the legions i can never win a soul so easy as that englishman's o how hast thou with jealousy infected the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful why so didst thou seem they grave and learn\u00e8d why so didst thou come they of noble family why so didst thou seem they religious why so didst thou or are they spare in diet free from gross passion or of mirth or anger constant in spirit not swerving with the blood garnished and decked in modest complement not working with the eye without the ear and but in purg\u00e8d judgment trusting neither such and so finely bolted didst thou seem and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot to mark the full fraught man and best endued with some suspicion i will weep for thee for this revolt of thine methinks is like another fall of man their faults are open arrest them to the answer of the law and god acquit them of their practices god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence you have conspired against our royal person joined with an enemy proclaimed and from his coffers received the golden earnest of our death wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter his princes and his peers to servitude his subjects to oppression and contempt and his whole kingdom into desolation touching our person seek we no revenge but we our kingdom's safety must so tender whose ruin you have sought that to her laws we do deliver you get you therefore hence poor miserable wretches to your death the taste whereof god of his mercy give you patience to endure and true repentance of all your dear offenses bear them hence now lords for france the enterprise whereof shall be to you as us like glorious we doubt not of a fair and lucky war since god so graciously hath brought to light this dangerous treason lurking in our way to hinder our beginnings we doubt not now but every rub is smooth\u00e8d on our way then forth dear countrymen let us deliver our puissance into the hand of god putting it straight in expedition cheerly to sea the signs of war advance no king of england if not king of france once more unto the breach dear friends once more or close the wall up with our english dead in peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility but when the blast of war blows in our ears then imitate the action of the tiger stiffen the sinews summon up the blood disguise fair nature with hard favored rage then lend the eye a terrible aspect let it pry through the portage of the head like the brass cannon let the brow o'erwhelm it as fearfully as doth a gall\u00e8d rock o'erhang and jutty his confounded base swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height on on you noblest english whose blood is fet from fathers of war proof fathers that like so many alexanders have in these parts from morn till even fought and sheathed their swords for lack of argument dishonor not your mothers now attest that those whom you called fathers did beget you be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war and you good yeomen whose limbs were made in england show us here the mettle of your pasture let us swear that you are worth your breeding which i doubt not for there is none of you so mean and base that hath not noble luster in your eyes i see you stand like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start the game's afoot follow your spirit and upon this charge cry god for harry england and saint george how yet resolves the governor of the town this is the latest parle we will admit therefore to our best mercy give yourselves or like to men proud of destruction defy us to our worst for as i am a soldier a name that in my thoughts becomes me best if i begin the batt'ry once again i will not leave the half achieved harfleur till in her ashes she lie buri\u00e8d the gates of mercy shall be all shut up and the fleshed soldier rough and hard of heart in liberty of bloody hand shall range with conscience wide as hell mowing like grass your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants what is it then to me if impious war arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends do with his smirched complexion all fell feats enlinked to waste and desolation what is 't to me when you yourselves are cause if your pure maidens fall into the hand of hot and forcing violation what rein can hold licentious wickedness when down the hill he holds his fierce career we may as bootless spend our vain command upon th' enrag\u00e8d soldiers in their spoil as send precepts to the leviathan to come ashore therefore you men of harfleur take pity of your town and of your people whiles yet my soldiers are in my command whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace o'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds of heady murder spoil and villainy if not why in a moment look to see the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand desire the locks of your shrill shrieking daughters your fathers taken by the silver beards and their most reverend heads dashed to the walls your naked infants spitted upon pikes whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry at herod's bloody hunting slaughtermen what say you will you yield and this avoid or guilty in defense be thus destroyed open your gates come uncle exeter go you and enter harfleur there remain and fortify it strongly 'gainst the french use mercy to them all for us dear uncle the winter coming on and sickness growing upon our soldiers we will retire to calais tonight in harfleur will we be your guest tomorrow for the march are we addressed how now fluellen cam'st thou from the bridge what men have you lost fluellen we would have all such offenders so cut off and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages nothing taken but paid for none of the french upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the gentler gamester is the soonest winner well then i know thee what shall i know of thee unfold it what is thy name i know thy quality thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back and tell thy king i do not seek him now but could be willing to march on to calais without impeachment for to say the sooth though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much unto an enemy of craft and vantage my people are with sickness much enfeebled my numbers lessened and those few i have almost no better than so many french who when they were in health i tell thee herald i thought upon one pair of english legs did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god that i do brag thus this your air of france hath blown that vice in me i must repent go therefore tell thy master here i am my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk my army but a weak and sickly guard yet god before tell him we will come on though france himself and such another neighbor stand in our way there's for thy labor montjoy go bid thy master well advise himself if we may pass we will if we be hindered we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolor and so montjoy fare you well the sum of all our answer is but this we would not seek a battle as we are nor as we are we say we will not shun it so tell your master we are in god's hand brother not in theirs march to the bridge it now draws toward night beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves and on tomorrow bid them march away gloucester 'tis true that we are in great danger the greater therefore should our courage be  good morrow brother bedford god almighty there is some soul of goodness in things evil would men observingly distill it out for our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers which is both healthful and good husbandry besides they are our outward consciences and preachers to us all admonishing that we should dress us fairly for our end thus may we gather honey from the weed and make a moral of the devil himself good morrow old sir thomas erpingham a good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of france 'tis good for men to love their present pains upon example so the spirit is eased and when the mind is quickened out of doubt the organs though defunct and dead before break up their drowsy grave and newly move with casted slough and fresh legerity lend me thy cloak sir thomas brothers both commend me to the princes in our camp do my good morrow to them and anon desire them all to my pavilion no my good knight go with my brothers to my lords of england i and my bosom must debate awhile and then i would no other company god a mercy old heart thou speak'st cheerfully a friend i am a gentleman of a company even so what are you then you are a better than the king harry le roy no i am a welshman yes do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yours and his kinsman too i thank you god be with you it sorts well with your fierceness though it appear a little out of fashion there is much care and valor in this welshman a friend under sir thomas erpingham even as men wracked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tide no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds methinks i could not die anywhere so contented as in the king's company his cause being just and his quarrel honorable so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his master's command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servant's damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrament of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is his vengeance so that here men are punished for before breach of the king's laws in now the king's quarrel where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited every subject's duty is the king's but every subject's soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed if i live to see it i will never trust his word after your reproof is something too round i should be angry with you if the time were convenient i embrace it give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it i will make it my quarrel there if ever i live to see it i will challenge it well i will do it though i take thee in the king's company indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no english treason to cut french crowns and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper upon the king let us our lives our souls our debts our careful wives our children and our sins lay on the king we must bear all o hard condition twin born with greatness subject to the breath of every fool whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing what infinite heart's ease must kings neglect that private men enjoy and what have kings that privates have not too save ceremony save general ceremony and what art thou thou idol ceremony what kind of god art thou that suffer'st more of mortal griefs than do thy worshipers what are thy rents what are thy comings in o ceremony show me but thy worth what is thy soul of adoration art thou aught else but place degree and form creating awe and fear in other men wherein thou art less happy being feared than they in fearing what drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet but poisoned flattery o be sick great greatness and bid thy ceremony give thee cure think'st thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation will it give place to flexure and low bending canst thou when thou command'st the beggar's knee command the health of it no thou proud dream that play'st so subtly with a king's repose i am a king that find thee and i know 'tis not the balm the scepter and the ball the sword the mace the crown imperial the intertissued robe of gold and pearl the farc\u00e8d title running 'fore the king the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world no not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony not all these laid in bed majestical can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave who with a body filled and vacant mind gets him to rest crammed with distressful bread never sees horrid night the child of hell but like a lackey from the rise to set sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night sleeps in elysium next day after dawn doth rise and help hyperion to his horse and follows so the ever running year with profitable labor to his grave and but for ceremony such a wretch winding up days with toil and nights with sleep had the forehand and vantage of a king the slave a member of the country's peace enjoys it but in gross brain little wots what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace whose hours the peasant best advantages good old knight collect them all together at my tent i'll be before thee o god of battles steel my soldiers' hearts possess them not with fear take from them now the sense of reck'ning or th' oppos\u00e8d numbers pluck their hearts from them not today o lord o not today think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown i richard's body have interr\u00e8d new and on it have bestowed more contrite tears than from it issued forc\u00e8d drops of blood five hundred poor i have in yearly pay who twice a day their withered hands hold up toward heaven to pardon blood and i have built two chantries where the sad and solemn priests sing still for richard's soul more will i do  though all that i can do is nothing worth since that my penitence comes after all imploring pardon my brother gloucester's voice ay i know thy errand i will go with thee the day my friends and all things stay for me what's he that wishes so my cousin westmoreland no my fair cousin if we are marked to die we are enough to do our country loss and if to live the fewer men the greater share of honor god's will i pray thee wish not one man more by jove i am not covetous for gold nor care i who doth feed upon my cost it yearns me not if men my garments wear such outward things dwell not in my desires but if it be a sin to covet honor i am the most offending soul alive no 'faith my coz wish not a man from england god's peace i would not lose so great an honor as one man more methinks would share from me for the best hope i have o do not wish one more rather proclaim it westmoreland through my host that he which hath no stomach to this fight let him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy put into his purse we would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us this day is called the feast of crispian he that outlives this day and comes safe home will stand o' tiptoe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of crispian he that shall see this day and live old age will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say tomorrow is saint crispian then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars old men forget yet all shall be forgot but he'll remember with advantages what feats he did that day then shall our names familiar in his mouth as household words harry the king bedford and exeter warwick and talbot salisbury and gloucester be in their flowing cups freshly remembered this story shall the good man teach his son and crispin crispian shall ne'er go by from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remember\u00e8d  we few we happy few we band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile this day shall gentle his condition and gentlemen in england now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon saint crispin's day all things are ready if our minds be so thou dost not wish more help from england coz why now thou hast unwished five thousand men which likes me better than to wish us one  you know your places god be with you all who hath sent thee now i pray thee bear my former answer back bid them achieve me and then sell my bones good god why should they mock poor fellows thus the man that once did sell the lion's skin while the beast lived was killed with hunting him a many of our bodies shall no doubt find native graves upon the which i trust shall witness live in brass of this day's work and those that leave their valiant bones in france dying like men though buried in your dunghills they shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them and draw their honors reeking up to heaven leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france mark then abounding valor in our english that being dead like to the bullet's crazing break out into a second course of mischief killing in relapse of mortality let me speak proudly tell the constable we are but warriors for the working day our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched with rainy marching in the painful field there's not a piece of feather in our host  good argument i hope we will not fly  and time hath worn us into slovenry but by the mass our hearts are in the trim and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night they'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck the gay new coats o'er the french soldiers' heads and turn them out of service if they do this as if god please they shall my ransom then will soon be levied herald save thou thy labor come thou no more for ransom gentle herald they shall have none i swear but these my joints which if they have as i will leave 'em them shall yield them little tell the constable i fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom take it brave york now soldiers march away and how thou pleasest god dispose the day well have we done thrice valiant countrymen but all's not done yet keep the french the field lives he good uncle thrice within this hour i saw him down thrice up again and fighting from helmet to the spur all blood he was i blame you not for hearing this i must perforce compound with my full eyes or they will issue too but hark what new alarum is this same the french have reinforced their scattered men then every soldier kill his prisoners give the word through i was not angry since i came to france until this instant take a trumpet herald ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill if they will fight with us bid them come down or void the field they do offend our sight if they'll do neither we will come to them and make them skirr away as swift as stones enforc\u00e8d from the old assyrian slings besides we'll cut the throats of those we have and not a man of them that we shall take shall taste our mercy go and tell them so how now what means this herald know'st thou not that i have fined these bones of mine for ransom com'st thou again for ransom i tell thee truly herald i know not if the day be ours or no for yet a many of your horsemen peer and gallop o'er the field praised be god and not our strength for it what is this castle called that stands hard by then call we this the field of agincourt fought on the day of crispin crispianus they did fluellen i wear it for a memorable honor for i am welsh you

purchase him a box o' th' ear it is the soldier's i by bargain should wear it myself follow good cousin warwick if that the soldier strike him as i judge by his blunt bearing he will keep his word

proclaim\u00e8d through our host to boast of this or take that praise from god which is his only yes captain but with this acknowledgment that god fought for us do we all holy rites let there be sung non nobis and te deum the dead with charity enclosed in clay and then to calais and to england then where ne'er from france arrived more happy men peace to this meeting wherefor we are met unto our brother france and to our sister health and fair time of day joy and good wishes to our most fair and princely cousin katherine  and as a branch and member of this royalty by whom this great assembly is contrived we do salute you duke of burgundy  and princes french and peers health to you all to cry amen to that thus we appear if duke of burgundy you would the peace whose want gives growth to th' imperfections which you have cited you must buy that peace with full accord to all our just demands whose tenors and particular effects you have enscheduled briefly in your hands well then the peace which you before so urged lies in his answer brother we shall go uncle exeter and brother clarence and you brother gloucester warwick and huntington go with the king and take with you free power to ratify augment or alter as your wisdoms best shall see advantageable for our dignity anything in or out of our demands and we'll consign thereto will you fair sister go with the princes or stay here with us yet leave our cousin katherine here with us she is our capital demand comprised within the forerank of our articles fair katherine and most fair will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady's ear and plead his love suit to her gentle heart o fair katherine if you will love me soundly with your french heart i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue do you like me kate an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel i said so dear katherine and i must not blush to affirm it what says she fair one that the tongues of men are full of deceits the princess is the better englishwoman  i' faith kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding i am glad thou canst speak no better english for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my crown i know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say i love you then if you urge me farther than to say do you in faith i wear out my suit give me your answer i' faith do and so clap hands and a bargain how say you lady marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake kate why you undid me for the one i have neither words nor measure and for the other i have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength if i could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken i should quickly leap into a wife or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favors i could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes never off but before god kate i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor i have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which i never use till urged nor never break for urging if thou canst love a fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth sun burning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook i speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that i shall die is true but for thy love by the lord no yet i love thee too and while thou liv'st dear kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors they do always reason themselves out again what a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly if thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king and what say'st thou then to my love speak my fair and fairly i pray thee no it is not possible you should love the enemy of france kate but in loving me you should love the friend of france for i love france so well that i will not part with a village of it i will have it all mine and kate when france is mine and i am yours then yours is france and you are mine no kate i will tell thee in french which i am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new married wife about her husband's neck hardly to be shook off je quand sur le possession de france et quand vous avez le possession de moi let me see what then saint denis be my speed donc v\u00f4tre est france et vous \u00eates mienne it is as easy for me kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more french i shall never move thee in french unless it be to laugh at me no faith is 't not kate but thy speaking of my tongue and i thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one but kate dost thou understand thus much english canst thou love me can any of your neighbors tell kate i'll ask them come i know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet you'll question this gentlewoman about me and i know kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart but good kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because i love thee cruelly if ever thou beest mine kate as i have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt i get thee with scambling and thou must therefore

of kings' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding i considering how honor would become such a person that it was no better than picture like to hang by th' wall if renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame to a cruel war i sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak i tell thee daughter i sprang not more in

dispositions if you had not showed them how you were disposed ere they lacked power to cross you ay and burn too pray be counseled i have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble but when extremities speak i have heard you say honor and policy like unsevered friends i' th' war do grow together grant that and tell me in peace what each of them by th' other lose that they combine not there if it be honor in your wars to seem the same you are not which for your best ends you adopt your policy how is it less or worse that it shall hold companionship in peace with honor as in war since that to both it stands in like request because that now it lies you on to speak to th' people not by your own instruction nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but roted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth now this no more dishonors you at all than to take in a town with gentle words which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required i should do so in honor i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin i prithee now my son go to them with this bonnet in thy hand and thus far having stretched it here be with them  thy knee bussing the stones for in such business action is eloquence and the eyes of th' ignorant more learn\u00e8d than the ears waving thy head which often thus correcting thy stout heart now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling or say to them thou art their soldier and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which thou dost confess were fit for thee to use as they to claim in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far as thou hast power and person prithee now go and be ruled although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower here is cominius he must and will  prithee now say you will and go about it i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said my praises made thee first a

thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death with as big heart as thou do as thou list thy valiantness was mine thou suck'st it from me but owe thy pride thyself do your will now

not grant us anything for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already yet we will ask that if you fail in our request the blame may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us should we be silent and not speak our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that

evident calamity though we had our wish which side should win for either thou must as a foreign recreant be led with manacles through our streets or else triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood for myself son i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine if i cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread  trust to 't thou shalt not on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world nay go not from us thus if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans thereby to destroy the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us as poisonous of your honor no our suit is that you reconcile them while the volsces may say this mercy we have showed the romans this we received and each in either side give the all hail to thee and cry be blest for making up this peace thou know'st great son the end of war's uncertain but this certain that if thou conquer rome the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name whose repetition will be dogged with curses whose chronicle thus writ the man was noble but with his last attempt he wiped it out destroyed his country and his name remains to th' ensuing age abhorred speak to me son thou hast affected the fine strains of honor to imitate the graces of the gods to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' th' air and yet to charge thy sulfur with a bolt that should but rive an oak why dost not speak think'st thou it honorable for a noble man still to remember wrongs daughter speak you he cares not for your weeping speak thou boy perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons there's no man in the world more bound to 's mother yet here he lets me prate like one i' th' stocks thou hast never in thy life showed thy dear mother any courtesy when she poor hen fond of no second brood has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaden with honor say my request's unjust and spurn me back but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee that thou restrain'st from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs he turns away  down ladies let us shame him with our knees to his surname coriolanus 'longs more pride than pity to our prayers down an end this is the last so we will home to rome and die among our neighbors nay behold 's this boy that cannot tell what he would have but kneels and holds up hands for fellowship does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny 't

my name were liable to fear i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius he reads much he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays as thou dost antony he hears no music seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit that could be moved to smile at anything such men as he be never at heart's ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves and therefore are they very dangerous i rather tell thee what is to be feared than what i fear for always i am caesar come on my right hand for this ear is deaf and tell me truly what thou think'st of him nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight thrice hath calphurnia in her sleep cried out help ho they murder caesar who's within go bid the

vanish\u00e8d what can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once of all the wonders that i yet have heard it seems to me most strange that men should fear seeing that death a necessary end will come when it will come what say the augurers the gods do this in shame of cowardice caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear no caesar shall not danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he we are two lions littered in one day and i the elder and more terrible and caesar shall go forth mark antony shall say i am not well and for thy humor i will stay at home here's

not come today tell them so decius shall caesar send a lie have i in conquest stretched mine arm so far to be afeard to tell graybeards the truth decius go tell them caesar will not come the cause is

saw my statue which like a fountain with an hundred spouts did run pure blood and many lusty romans came smiling and did bathe their hands in it and these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent and on her knee hath begged that i will stay at home today and this way have you well expounded it how foolish do your fears seem now calphurnia i am asham\u00e8d i did yield to them

could never be her mild companion you gods that made me man and sway in love that have inflamed desire in my breast to taste the fruit of yon celestial tree or die in th' adventure be my helps as i am son and servant to your will to compass such a boundless happiness that would be son to great antiochus antiochus i thank thee who hath taught my frail mortality to know itself and by those fearful objects to prepare this body like to them to what i must for death remembered should be like a mirror who tells us life's but breath to trust it error i'll make my will then and as sick men do who know the world see heaven but feeling woe gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did so i bequeath a happy peace to you and all good men as every prince should do my riches to the earth from whence they came but my unspotted fire of love to you  thus ready for the way of life or death i wait the sharpest blow like a bold champion i assume the lists nor ask advice of any other thought but faithfulness and courage i am no viper yet i feed on mother's flesh which did me breed i sought a husband in which labor i found that kindness in a father he's father son and husband mild i mother wife and yet his child how they may be and yet in two as you will live resolve it you sharp physic is the last but o you powers that gives heaven countless eyes to view men's acts why cloud they not their sights perpetually if this be true which makes me pale to read it fair glass of light i loved you and could still were not this glorious casket stored with ill but i must tell you now my thoughts revolt for he's no man on whom perfections wait that knowing sin within will touch the gate you are a fair viol and your sense the strings who fingered to make man his lawful music would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken but being played upon before your time hell only danceth at so harsh a chime good sooth i care not for you great king few love to hear the sins they love to act 'twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it who has a book of all that monarchs do he's more secure to keep it shut than shown for vice repeated is like the wand'ring wind blows dust in others' eyes to spread itself and yet the end of all is bought thus dear the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear to stop the air would hurt them the blind mole casts copped hills towards heaven to tell the earth is thronged by man's oppression and the poor worm doth die for 't kings are earth's gods in vice their law's their will and if jove stray who dares say jove doth ill it is enough you know and it is fit what being more known grows worse to smother it all love the womb that their first being bred then give my tongue like leave to love my head how courtesy would seem to cover sin when what is done is like an hypocrite the which is good in nothing but in sight if it be true that i interpret false then were it certain you were not so bad as with foul incest to abuse your soul where now you're both a father and a son by your untimely claspings with your child which pleasures fits a husband not a father and she an eater of her mother's flesh by the defiling of her parents' bed and both like serpents are who though they feed on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men blush not in actions blacker than the night will 'schew no course to keep them from the light one sin i know another doth provoke murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke poison and treason are the hands of sin ay and the targets to put off the shame then lest my life be cropped to keep you clear by flight i'll shun the danger which i fear let none disturb us why should this change of thoughts the sad companion dull eyed melancholy be my so used a guest as not an hour in the day's glorious walk or peaceful night the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them and danger which i feared is at antioch whose arm seems far too short to hit me here yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits nor yet the other's distance comfort me then it is thus the passions of the mind that have their first conception by misdread have after nourishment and life by care and what was first but fear what might be done grows elder now and cares it be not done and so with me the great antiochus 'gainst whom i am too little to contend since he's so great can make his will his act will think me speaking though i swear to silence nor boots it me to say i honor him if he suspect i may dishonor him and what may make him blush in being known he'll stop the course by which it might be known with hostile forces he'll o'er spread the land and with th' ostent of war will look so huge amazement shall drive courage

to princes and bring joys to subjects her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder the rest hark in thine ear as black as incest which by my knowledge found the sinful father seemed not to strike but smooth but thou know'st this 'tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss which fear so grew in me i hither fled under the covering of a careful night who seemed my good protector and being here bethought me what was past what might succeed i knew him tyrannous and tyrants' fears decrease not but grow faster than the years and should he doubt as no doubt he doth that i should open to the list'ning air how many worthy princes' bloods were shed to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope to lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms and make pretense of wrong that i have done him when all for mine if i may call 't offense must feel war's blow who spares not innocence which love to all of which thyself art one who now reproved'st me for 't  drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks musings into my mind with thousand doubts how i might stop this tempest ere it came and finding little comfort to relieve them i thought it princely charity to grieve for them i do not doubt thy faith but should he wrong my liberties in my absence tyre i now look from thee then and to tarsus intend my travel where i'll hear from thee and by whose letters i'll dispose myself the care i had and have of subjects' good on thee i lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it i'll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath who shuns not to break one will crack both but in our orbs we'll live so

cast me on the rocks washed me from shore to shore and left my breath nothing to think on but ensuing death let it suffice the greatness of your powers to have bereft a prince of all his fortunes and having thrown him from your wat'ry grave here to have death in peace is all he'll crave a pretty moral simonides how from the finny subject of the sea these fishers tell the infirmities of men and from their wat'ry empire recollect all that may men approve or men detect  peace be at your labor honest fishermen may see the sea hath cast upon your coast  a man whom both the waters and the wind in that vast tennis court hath made the ball for them to play upon entreats you pity him he asks of you that never used to beg i never practiced it what i have been i have forgot to know but what i am

crowns to his supremacy where now his son's like a glowworm in the night the which hath fire in darkness none in light whereby i see that time's the king of men he's both their parent and he is their grave and gives them what he will not what they crave i thank him i thank both him and you and pledge him freely a gentleman of tyre my name pericles my education been in arts and arms who looking for

it agreed upon that the prince should woo hero for himself and having obtained her give her to count claudio we'll wait upon your lordship and that is claudio i know him by his bearing so did i too and he swore he would marry her tonight yea my lord but i can cross it not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in the favor of margaret the waiting gentlewoman to hero i can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window the poison of that lies in you to temper go you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honor in marrying the renowned claudio whose estimation do you mightily hold up to a contaminated stale such a one as hero proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio to undo hero and kill leonato look you for any other issue go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio as in love of your brother's honor who hath made this match and his friend's reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid that you have discovered thus they will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me call margaret hero hear margaret term me claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown be you constant in the accusation and my cunning

placed and possessed by my master don john saw afar off in the orchard this amiable amiable encounter two of them did the prince and claudio but the devil my master knew she was margaret and partly by his oaths which first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villainy which did confirm any slander that don john had made away went claudio enraged swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw o'ernight and send her home again without a husband we are like to

had indeed against us passed but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question it must be thought on if it pass against us we lose the better half of our possession for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us being valued thus as much as would maintain to the king's honor full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand and two hundred good esquires and to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil a hundred almshouses right well supplied and to the coffers of the king besides a thousand pounds by th' year thus runs the bill 'twould drink the cup and all the king is full of grace and fair regard the courses of his youth promised it not the breath no sooner left his father's body but that his wildness mortified in him seemed to die too yea at that very moment consideration like an angel came and whipped th' offending adam out of him leaving his body as a paradise t' envelop and contain celestial spirits never was such a sudden scholar made never came reformation in a flood with such a heady currance scouring faults nor never hydra headed willfulness so soon did lose his seat and all at once as in this king hear him but reason in divinity and all admiring with an inward wish you would desire the king were made a prelate hear him debate of commonwealth affairs you would say it hath been all in all his study list his discourse of war and you shall hear a fearful battle rendered you in music turn him to any cause of policy the gordian knot of it he will unloose familiar as his garter that when he speaks the air a chartered libertine is still and the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears to steal his sweet and honeyed sentences so that the art and practic part of life must be the mistress to this theoric which is a wonder how his grace should glean it since his addiction was to courses vain his companies unlettered rude and shallow his hours filled up with riots banquets sports and never noted in him any study any retirement any sequestration from open haunts and popularity it must be so for miracles are ceased and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected he seems indifferent or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing th' exhibitors against us for i have made an offer to his majesty  upon our spiritual convocation and in regard of causes now in hand which i have opened to his grace at large as touching france to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal with good acceptance of his majesty  save that there was not time enough to hear as i perceived his grace would fain have done the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france derived from edward his great grandfather the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience and the hour i think is come to give him hearing is it four o'clock then go we in to know his embassy which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe yourselves your lives and services to this imperial throne there is no bar to make against your highness' claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant no woman shall succeed in salic land which salic land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salic is in germany between the floods of sala and of elbe where charles the great having subdued the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life established then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salic land which salic as i said 'twixt elbe and sala is at this day in germany called meissen then doth it well appear the salic law was not devis\u00e8d for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salic land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly supposed the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred twenty six and charles the great subdued the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five besides their writers say king pepin which depos\u00e8d childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france hugh capet also who usurped the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shows of truth though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught conveyed himself as th' heir to th' lady lingare daughter to charlemagne who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was reunited to the crown of france so that as clear as is the summer's sun king pepin's title and hugh capet's claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to hold in right and title of the female so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salic law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles usurped from you and your progenitors the sin upon my head dread sovereign for in the book of numbers is it writ when the man dies let the inheritance descend unto the daughter gracious lord stand for your own unwind your bloody flag look back into your mighty ancestors go my dread lord to your great grandsire's tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your great uncle's edward the black prince who on the french ground played a tragedy making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp forage in blood of french nobility o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by all out of work and cold for action o let their bodies follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors they of those marches gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers she hath been then more feared than harmed my liege for hear her but exampled by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edward's fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of

others like merchants venture trade abroad others like soldiers arm\u00e8d in their stings make boot upon the summer's velvet buds which pillage they with merry march bring home to the tent royal of their emperor who busied in his majesty surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold the civil citizens kneading up the honey the poor mechanic porters crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate the sad eyed justice with his surly hum delivering o'er to executors pale the lazy yawning drone i this infer that many things having full reference to one consent may work contrariously as many arrows loos\u00e8d several ways come to one mark as many ways meet in one town as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea as many lines close in the dial's center so may a thousand actions once afoot end in one purpose and be all well borne without defeat therefore to france my liege divide your happy england into four whereof take you one quarter into france and you withal shall make

saw him not these many years and yet i know 'tis he we are held as outlaws hence no company's abroad i cannot tell long is it since i saw him but time hath nothing blurred those lines of favor which then he wore the snatches in his voice and burst of speaking were as his i am absolute 'twas very cloten being scarce made up i mean to man he had not apprehension of roaring terrors for defect of judgment is oft the cause of fear but see thy brother what hast thou done we are all undone no single soul can we set eye on but in all safe reason he must have some attendants though his humor was

of praise or to the worth of the great count himself she is too mean to have her name repeated all her deserving is a reserv\u00e8d honesty and that i have not heard examined how do you mean maybe the

have found it the count he woos your daughter lays down his wanton siege before her beauty resolved to carry her let her in fine consent as we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it now his important blood will naught deny that she'll demand a ring the county wears that downward hath succeeded in his house from son to son some four or five descents since the first father wore it this ring he holds in most rich choice yet in his idle fire to buy his will it would not seem too dear howe'er repented after you see it lawful then it is no more but that your daughter ere she seems as won desires this ring appoints him an encounter in fine delivers me to fill the time herself most chastely absent after to marry her i'll add three thousand crowns to what is passed already why then tonight let us assay our plot which if it speed is wicked meaning in a lawful deed and lawful meaning in a lawful act where both not sin and yet a sinful fact but let's about it that you may well perceive i have not wronged you one of the greatest in the christian world shall be my surety 'fore whose throne 'tis needful ere i can perfect mine intents to kneel time was i did him a desir\u00e8d office dear almost

more truly labor to recompense your love doubt not but heaven hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower as it hath fated her to be my motive and helper to a husband but o strange men that can such sweet use make of what they hate when saucy trusting of the cozened thoughts defiles the pitchy night so lust doth play with what it loathes for that which is away but more of this hereafter you

not listening the malady of not marking that i am troubled withal i am as poor as job my lord but not so patient your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but how i should be your patient to follow your prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a scruple or indeed a scruple itself as i was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land

bardolph lead the men away as i return i will fetch off these justices i do see the bottom of justice shallow lord lord how subject we old men are to this vice of lying this same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about turnbull street and every third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the turk's tribute i do remember him at clement's inn like a man made after supper of a cheese paring when he was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife he was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible he was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores called him mandrake he came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle and swore they were his fancies or his good nights and now is this vice's dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of john o' gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and i'll be sworn he ne'er saw him but once in the tilt yard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal's men i saw it and told john o' gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel skin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court and now has he land and beefs well i'll be acquainted with him if i return and 't shall go hard but i'll make him a philosopher's two stones to me if the young dace be a bait for the old pike i see no reason in the law of nature but i may snap at him let time shape and there an end what's your name sir of what condition are you and of what place i pray well then colevile is your name a knight is your degree and your place the dale colevile shall be still your name a traitor your degree and the dungeon your place a place deep enough so shall you be still colevile of the dale as good a man as he sir whoe'er i am do you yield sir or shall i sweat for you if i do sweat they are the drops of thy lovers and they weep for thy death therefore rouse up fear and trembling and do observance to my mercy i have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name an i had but a belly of any indifferency i were simply the most active fellow in europe my womb my womb my womb undoes me here comes our general i would be sorry my lord but it should be thus i never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valor do you think me a swallow an arrow or a bullet have i in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought i have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility i have foundered ninescore and odd posts and here travel tainted as i am have in my pure and immaculate valor taken sir john colevile of the dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy but what of that he saw me and yielded that i may justly say with the hook nosed fellow of rome there cousin i came saw and overcame i know not here he is and here i yield him and i beseech your grace let it be booked with the rest of this day's deeds or by the lord i will have it in a particular ballad else with mine own picture on the top on 't colevile kissing my foot to the which course if i be enforced if you do not all show like gilt twopences to me and i in the clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element which show like pins' heads to her believe not the word of the noble therefore let me have right and let desert mount let it shine then let it do something my good lord that may do me good and call it what you will and a famous true subject took him i know not how they sold themselves but thou like a kind fellow gavest thyself away gratis and i thank thee for thee my lord i beseech you give me leave to go through gloucestershire and when you come to court stand my good lord pray in your good report i would you had but the wit 'twere better than your dukedom good faith this same young sober blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but that's no marvel he drinks no wine there's never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood and making many fish meals that they fall into a kind of male green sickness and then when they marry they get wenches they are generally fools and cowards which some of us should be too but for inflammation a good sherris sack hath a two fold operation in it it ascends me into the brain dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which delivered o'er to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit the second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts' extremes it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puffed up with this retinue doth any deed of courage and this valor comes of sherris so that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it a work and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use hereof comes it that prince harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant if i had a thousand sons the first human principle i would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack how

come away you must excuse me master robert shallow i'll follow you good master robert shallow bardolph look to our horses if i were sawed into quantities i should make four dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as master shallow it is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his they by observing of him do bear themselves like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned into a justice like servingman their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild geese if i had a suit to master shallow i would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master if to his men i would curry with master shallow that no man could better command his servants it is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed of their company i will devise matter enough out of this shallow to keep prince harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four terms or two actions and he shall laugh without intervallums o it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders o you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up i come master shallow i come master shallow fore god you

the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter let her not walk i' th' sun conception is a blessing but as your daughter may conceive friend look to 't words words words between who slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have gray beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself sir shall grow old as i am if like a crab you could go backward into my grave you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life these tedious old fools my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do you both nor the soles of her shoe then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favors in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what news then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither denmark's a prison a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o' th' worst why then 'tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams a dream itself is but a shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows shall we to th' court for by my fay i cannot reason no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come come deal justly with me come come nay speak anything but to th' purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color i know the good king and queen have sent for you that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer can charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen molt no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o'erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor women neither though by your smiling you seem to say so why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute on me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' th' sear and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for 't what players are they how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed how comes it do they grow rusty what are they children who maintains 'em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession is 't possible do the boys carry it away it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little 'sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come then th' appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outwards should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir a monday morning 'twas then indeed my lord i have news to tell you when roscius was an actor in rome  buzz buzz then came each actor on his ass o jephthah judge of israel what a treasure hadst thou why one fair daughter and no more the which he lov\u00e8d passing

where my abridgment comes you are welcome masters welcome all i am glad to see thee well welcome good friends o my old friend why thy face is valanced since i saw thee last com'st thou to beard me in denmark what my young lady and mistress by 'r lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chopine pray god your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring masters you are all welcome we'll e'en to 't like french falconers fly at anything we see we'll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million 'twas caviary to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in 't i chiefly loved 'twas aeneas' tale to dido and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of priam's slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th' hyrcanian beast  'tis not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couch\u00e8d in th' ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smeared with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly tricked with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons baked and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damn\u00e8d light to their lord's murder roasted in wrath and fire and thus o'ersiz\u00e8d with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you it shall to the barber's with your beard  prithee say on he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba the mobl\u00e8d queen 'tis well i'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live god's bodykins man much better use every man after his desert and who shall 'scape whipping use them after your own honor and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in follow him friends we'll hear a play tomorrow dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago we'll ha 't tomorrow night you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in 't could you not very well follow that lord and look you mock him not my good friends i'll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore ay so good bye to you now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wanned tears in his eyes distraction in his aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what's hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appall the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damned defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i' th' throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha 'swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeon livered and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave's offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murdered prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a stallion fie upon 't foh about my brains hum i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i'll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i'll observe his looks i'll tent him to the quick if he do blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be a devil and the devil hath power t' assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i'll have grounds more relative than this the play's the thing wherein i'll catch the conscience of the king to be or not to be that is the question whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep  no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished to die to sleep  to sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there's the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time th' oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely the pangs of despised love the law's delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of th' unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pitch and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remembered i humbly thank you well no not i i never gave you aught ha ha are you honest are you fair that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offenses at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where's your father let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in 's own house farewell if thou dost marry i'll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell i have heard of your paintings too well enough god hath given you one face and you make yourselves another you jig and amble and you lisp you nickname god's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance go to i'll no more on 't it hath made me mad i say we will have no more marriage those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are to a nunnery go speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of our players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so o'erdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it makes the unskillful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theater of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having th' accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that's villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready how now my lord will the king hear this piece of work bid the players make haste will you two help to hasten them what ho horatio horatio thou art e'en as just a man as e'er my conversation coped withal nay do not think i flatter for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits to feed and clothe thee why should the poor be flattered no let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning dost thou hear since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish her election hath sealed thee for herself for thou hast been as one in suffering all that suffers nothing a man that fortune's buffets and rewards hast ta'en with equal thanks and blessed are those whose blood and judgment are so well commeddled that they are not a pipe for fortune's finger to sound what stop she please give me that man that is not passion's slave and i will wear him in my heart's core ay in my heart of heart as i do thee something too much of this  there is a play tonight before the king one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my father's death i prithee when thou seest that act afoot even with the very comment of thy soul observe my uncle if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech it is a damn\u00e8d ghost that we have seen and my imaginations are as foul as vulcan's stithy give him heedful note for i mine eyes will rivet to his face and after we will both our judgments join in censure of his seeming they are coming to the play i must be idle get you a place excellent i' faith of the chameleon's dish i eat the air promise crammed you cannot feed capons so no nor mine now my lord you played once i' th' university you say what did you enact it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there be the players ready no good mother here's metal more attractive lady shall i lie in your lap i mean my head upon your lap do you think i meant country matters that's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs nothing who i o god your only jig maker what should a man do but be merry for look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died within 's two hours so long nay then let the devil wear black for i'll have a suit of sables o heavens die two months ago and not forgotten yet then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year but by 'r lady he must build churches then or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the hobby horse whose epitaph is for oh for oh the hobby horse is forgot marry this is miching mallecho it means mischief we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel they'll tell all ay or any show that you will show him be not you ashamed to show he'll not shame to tell you what it means is this a prologue or the posy of a ring as woman's love that's wormwood if she should break it now madam how like you this play o but she'll keep her word no no they do but jest poison in jest no offense i' th' world the mousetrap marry how tropically this play is the image of a murder done in vienna gonzago

are unwrung this is one lucianus nephew to the king i could interpret between you and your love if i could see the puppets dallying it would cost you a groaning to take off mine edge so you mis take your husbands begin murderer pox leave thy damnable faces and begin come the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge he poisons him i' th' garden for his estate his name's gonzago the story is extant and written in very choice italian you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of gonzago's wife what frighted with false fire why let the strucken deer go weep the hart ungall\u00e8d play for some must watch while some must sleep thus runs the world away would not this sir and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn turk with me with two provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players a whole one i for thou dost know o damon dear this realm dismantled was of jove himself and now reigns here a very very pajock o good horatio i'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound didst perceive upon the talk of the poisoning ah ha come some music come the recorders for if the king like not the comedy why then belike he likes it not perdy come some music sir a whole history ay sir what of him with drink sir your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor for for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more choler i am tame sir pronounce you are welcome sir i cannot make you a wholesome answer my wit's diseased but sir such answer as i can make you shall command or rather as you say my mother therefore no more but to the matter my mother you say  o wonderful son that can so 'stonish a mother but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration impart we shall obey were she ten times our mother have you any further trade with us and do still by these pickers and stealers sir i lack advancement ay sir but while the grass grows the proverb is something musty o the recorders let me see one to withdraw with you why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil i do not well understand that will you play upon this pipe i pray you i do beseech you it is as easy as lying govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music look you these are the stops why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me you would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it speak 'sblood do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe call me what instrument you will though you can fret me you cannot play upon me god bless you sir do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel methinks it is like a weasel or like a whale then i will come to my mother by and by they fool me to the top of my bent i will come by and by by and by is easily said leave me friends 'tis now the very witching time of night when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world now could i drink hot blood and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on soft now to my mother o heart lose not thy nature let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom let me be cruel not unnatural i will speak daggers to her but use none my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites how in my words somever she be shent to give them seals never my soul consent now might i do it pat now he is a praying and now i'll do 't and so he goes to heaven and so am i revenged that would be scanned a villain kills my father and for that i his sole son do this same villain send to heaven why this is hire and salary not revenge he took my father grossly full of bread with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may and how his audit stands who knows save heaven but in our circumstance and course of thought 'tis heavy with him and am i then revenged to take him in the purging of his soul when he is fit and seasoned for his passage no up sword and know thou a more horrid hent when he is drunk asleep or in his rage or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed at game a swearing or about some act that has no relish of salvation in 't  then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven and that his soul may be as damned and black as hell whereto it goes my mother stays this physic but prolongs thy sickly days mother mother mother now mother what's the matter mother you have my father much offended go go you question with a wicked tongue what's the matter now no by the rood not so you are the queen your husband's brother's wife and would it were not so you are my mother come come and sit you down you shall not budge you go not till i set you up a glass where you may see the inmost part of you how now a rat dead for a ducat dead nay i know not is it the king a bloody deed almost as bad good mother as kill a king and marry with his brother ay lady it was my word thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell i took thee for thy better take thy fortune thou find'st to be too busy is some danger leave wringing of your hands peace sit you down and let me wring your heart for so i shall if it be made of penetrable stuff if damn\u00e8d custom have not brazed it so that it be proof and bulwark against sense such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and sets a blister there makes marriage vows as false as dicers' oaths o such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words heaven's face does glow o'er this solidity and compound mass with heated visage as against the doom is thought sick at the act look here upon this picture and on this the counterfeit presentment of two brothers see what a grace was seated on this brow hyperion's curls the front of jove himself an eye like mars' to threaten and command a station like the herald mercury new lighted on a kissing hill a combination and a form indeed where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance of a man this was your husband look you now what follows here is your husband like a mildewed ear blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes could you on this fair mountain leave to feed and batten on this moor ha have you eyes you cannot call it love for at your age the heyday in the blood is tame it's humble and waits upon the judgment and what judgment would step from this to this sense sure you have else could you not have motion but sure that sense is apoplexed for madness would not err nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thralled but it reserved some quantity of choice to serve in such a difference what devil was 't that thus hath cozened you at hoodman blind eyes without feeling feeling without sight ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope o shame where is thy blush rebellious hell if thou canst mutine in a matron's bones to flaming youth let virtue be as wax and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardor gives the charge since frost itself as actively doth burn and reason panders will nay but to live in the rank sweat of an enseam\u00e8d bed stewed in corruption honeying and making love over the nasty sty a murderer and a villain a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord a vice of kings a cutpurse of the empire and the rule that from a shelf the precious diadem stole and put it in his pocket  a king of shreds and patches  save me and hover o'er me with your wings you heavenly guards what would your gracious figure do you not come your tardy son to chide that lapsed in time and passion lets go by th' important acting of your dread command o say how is it with you lady on him on him look you how pale he glares his form and cause conjoined preaching to stones would make them capable do not look upon me lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects then what i have to do will want true color tears perchance for blood do you see nothing there nor did you nothing hear why look you there look how it steals away my father in his habit as he lived look where he goes even now out at the portal ecstasy my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time and makes as healthful music it is not madness that i have uttered bring me to the test and i the matter will reword which madness would gambol from mother for love of grace lay not that flattering unction to your soul that not your trespass but my madness speaks it will but skin and film the ulcerous place whiles rank corruption mining all within infects unseen confess yourself to heaven repent what's past avoid what is to come and do not spread the compost on the weeds to make them ranker forgive me this my virtue for in the fatness of these pursy times virtue itself of vice must pardon beg yea curb and woo for leave to do him good o throw away the worser part of it and live the purer with the other half good night but go not to my uncle's bed assume a virtue if you have it not that monster custom who all sense doth eat of habits devil is angel yet in this that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery that aptly is put on refrain tonight and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence the next more easy for use almost can change the stamp of nature and either the devil or throw him out with wondrous potency once more good night and when you are desirous to be blest i'll blessing beg of you for this same lord i do repent but heaven hath pleased it so to punish me with this and this with me that i must be their scourge and minister i will bestow him and will answer well the death i gave him so again good night i must be cruel only to be kind this bad begins and worse remains behind one word more good lady not this by no means that i bid you do let the bloat king tempt you again to bed pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse and let him for a pair of reechy kisses or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers make you to ravel all this matter out that i essentially am not in madness but mad in craft 'twere good you let him know for who that's but a queen fair sober wise would from a paddock from a bat a gib such dear concernings hide who would do so no in despite of sense and secrecy unpeg the basket on the house's top let the birds fly and like the famous ape to try conclusions in the basket creep and break your own neck down i must to england you know that there's letters sealed and my two schoolfellows whom i will trust as i will adders fanged they bear the mandate they must sweep my way and marshal me to knavery let it work for 'tis the sport to have the enginer hoist with his own petard and 't shall go hard but i will delve one yard below their mines and blow them at the moon o 'tis most sweet when in one line two crafts directly meet this man shall set me packing i'll lug the guts into the neighbor room mother good night indeed this counselor is now most still most secret and most grave who was in life a foolish prating knave  come sir to draw toward an end with you  good night mother safely stowed but soft what noise who calls on hamlet o here they come compounded it with dust whereto 'tis kin do not believe it that i can keep your counsel and not mine own besides to be demanded of a sponge what replication should be made by the son of a king ay sir that soaks up the king's countenance his rewards his authorities but such officers do the king best service in the end he keeps them like an ape an apple in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to be last swallowed when he needs what you have gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again i am glad of it a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear the body is with the king but the king is not with the body the king is a thing  of nothing bring me to him hide fox and all after at supper not where he eats but where he is eaten a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him your worm is your only emperor for diet we fat all creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for maggots your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes but to one table that's the end a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar in heaven send thither to see if your messenger find him not there seek him i' th' other place yourself but if indeed you find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby he will stay till you come for england good i see a cherub that sees them but come for england farewell dear mother my mother father and mother is man and wife man and wife is one flesh and so my mother  come for england good sir whose powers are these how purposed sir i pray you who commands them sir goes it against the main of poland sir or for some frontier why then the polack never will defend it two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats will not debate the question of this straw this is th' impostume of much wealth and peace that inward breaks and shows no cause without why the man dies i humbly thank you sir i'll be with you straight go a little before how all occasions do inform against me and spur my dull revenge what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed a beast no more sure he that made us with such large discourse looking before and after gave us not that capability and godlike reason to fust in us unused now whether it be bestial oblivion or some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on th' event a thought which quartered hath but one part wisdom and ever three parts coward i do not know why yet i live to say this thing's to do sith i have cause and will and strength and means to do 't examples gross as earth exhort me witness this army of such mass and charge led by a delicate and tender prince whose spirit with divine ambition puffed makes mouths at the invisible event exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune death and danger dare even for an eggshell rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honor's at the stake how stand i then that have a father killed a mother stained excitements of my reason and my blood and let all sleep while to my shame i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men that for a fantasy and trick of fame go to their graves like beds fight for a plot whereon the numbers cannot try the cause which is not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain o from this time forth my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth has this fellow no feeling of his business he sings in grave making 'tis e'en so the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once how the knave jowls it to the ground as if 'twere cain's jawbone that did the first murder this might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o'erreaches one that would circumvent god might it not or of a courtier which could say good morrow sweet lord how dost thou sweet lord this might be my lord such a one that praised my lord such a one's horse when he went to beg it might it not why e'en so and now my lady worm's chapless and knocked about the mazard with a sexton's spade here's fine revolution an we had the trick to see 't did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with them mine ache to think on 't there's another why may not that be the skull of a lawyer where be his quiddities now his quillities his cases his tenures and his tricks why does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery hum this fellow might be in 's time a great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures the very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box and must th' inheritor himself have no more ha is not parchment made of sheepskins they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that i will speak to this fellow  whose grave's this sirrah i think it be thine indeed for thou liest in 't thou dost lie in 't to be in 't and say it is thine 'tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest what man dost thou dig it for what woman then who is to be buried in 't how absolute the knave is we must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us by the lord horatio this three years i have took note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe how long hast thou been grave maker how long is that since ay marry why was he sent into england why how came he mad how strangely upon what ground how long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot why he more than another whose was it nay i know not this let me see alas poor yorick i knew him horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath bore me on his back a thousand times and now how abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rises at it here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft where be your gibes now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar not one now to mock your own grinning quite chapfallen now get you to my lady's chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this favor she must come make her laugh at that prithee horatio tell me one thing dost thou think alexander looked o' this fashion i' th' earth and smelt so pah to what base uses we may return horatio why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died alexander was buried alexander returneth to dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer barrel imperious caesar dead and turned to clay might stop a hole to keep the wind away o that that earth which kept the world in awe should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw but soft but soft awhile here comes the king the queen the courtiers who is this they follow and with such maim\u00e8d rites this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desp'rate hand fordo its own life 'twas of some estate couch we awhile and mark that is laertes a very noble youth mark what the fair ophelia what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wand'ring stars and makes them stand like wonder wounded hearers this is i hamlet the dane thou pray'st not well i prithee take thy fingers from my throat for though i am not splenitive and rash yet have i in me something dangerous which let thy wisdom fear hold off thy hand why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum what wilt thou do for her 'swounds show me what thou 't do woo't weep woo't fight woo't fast woo't tear thyself woo't drink up eisel eat a crocodile i'll do 't dost thou come here to whine to outface me with leaping in her grave be buried quick with her and so will i and if thou prate of mountains let them throw millions of acres on us till our ground singeing his pate against the burning zone make ossa like a wart nay an thou 'lt mouth i'll rant as well as thou hear you sir what is the reason that you use me thus i loved you ever but it is no matter let hercules himself do what he may the cat will mew and dog will have his day so much for this sir now shall you see the other you do remember all the circumstance sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly  and praised be rashness for it let us know our indiscretion sometime serves us well when our deep plots do pall and that should learn us there's a divinity that shapes our ends rough hew them how we will  up from my cabin my sea gown scarfed about me in the dark groped i to find out them had my desire fingered their packet and in fine withdrew to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unfold their grand commission where i found horatio a royal knavery an exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmark's health and england's too with ho such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the ax my head should be struck off here's the commission read it at more leisure but wilt thou hear now how i did proceed being thus benetted round with villainies or i could make a prologue to my brains they had begun the play i sat me down devised a new commission wrote it fair  i once did hold it as our statists do a baseness to write fair and labored much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeoman's service wilt thou know th' effect of what i wrote an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm might flourish as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma 'tween their amities and many suchlike es of great charge that on the view and knowing of these contents without debatement further more or less he should those bearers put to sudden death not shriving time allowed why even in that was heaven ordinant i had my father's signet in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in the form of th' other subscribed it gave 't th' impression placed it safely the changeling never known now the next day was our sea fight and what to this was sequent thou knowest already why man they did make love to this employment they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow 'tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incens\u00e8d points of mighty opposites does it not think thee stand me now upon  he that hath killed my king and whored my mother popped in between th' election and my hopes thrown out his angle for my proper life and with such cozenage is 't not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm and is 't not to be damned to let this canker of our nature come in further evil it will be short the interim's mine and a man's life's no more than to say one but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his i'll court his favors but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a tow'ring passion i humbly thank you sir dost know this waterfly thy state is the more gracious for 'tis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king's mess 'tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit put your bonnet to his right use 'tis for the head no believe me 'tis very cold the wind is northerly but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion i beseech you remember sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath what imports the nomination of this gentleman of him sir i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself what's his weapon that's two of his weapons but well  what call you the carriages the phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages  that's the french bet against the danish why is this all impawned as you call it how if i answer no sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty it is the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will yours he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for 's turn he did comply sir with his dug before he sucked it thus has he and many more of the same breed that i know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and out of an habit of encounter a kind of yeasty collection which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out i am constant to my purposes they follow the king's pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now in happy time she well instructs me i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart but it is no matter it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman not a whit we defy augury there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now 'tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man of aught he leaves knows what is 't to leave betimes let be give me your pardon sir i have done you wrong but pardon 't as you are a gentleman this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punished with a sore distraction what i have done that might your nature honor and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness was 't hamlet wronged laertes never hamlet if hamlet from himself be ta'en away and when he's not himself does wrong laertes then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it who does it then his madness if 't be so hamlet is of the faction that is wronged his madness is poor hamlet's enemy sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot my arrow o'er the house and hurt my brother i embrace it freely and will this brothers' wager frankly play  give us the foils come on i'll be your foil laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i' th' darkest night stick fiery off indeed no by this hand very well my lord your grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side this likes me well these foils have all a length come on sir one judgment i'll play this bout first set it by awhile come

crowns in my purse i have and goods at home and so am come abroad to see the world signior hortensio 'twixt such friends as we few words suffice and therefore if thou know one rich enough to be petruchio's wife as wealth is burden of my wooing dance be she as foul as was florentius' love as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd as socrates' xanthippe or a worse she moves me not or not removes

therefore drawn between us that covenants may be kept on either hand why that is nothing for i tell you father i am as peremptory as she proud minded and where two raging fires meet together they do consume the thing that feeds their fury though little fire grows great with little wind yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all so i to her and so she yields to me for i am rough and woo not like

falsehood yea as much as you have done my truth if he know that i am free of your report he knows i am not of your wrong therefore in him it lies to cure me and the cure is to remove these thoughts

infinite he tells you rightly madam this is a mere distraction you turn the good we offer into envy madam you wander from the good we aim at pray hear me if your grace could but be brought to know our

great graces heaped upon me poor undeserver i can nothing render but allegiant thanks my prayers to heaven for you my loyalty which ever has and ever shall be growing till death that winter kill it i do profess that for your highness' good i ever labored more than mine own that am have and will be  though all the world should crack their duty to you and throw it from their soul though perils did

new device to beat this from his brains i know 'twill stir him strongly yet i know a way if it take right in spite of fortune will bring me off again what's this to th' pope the letter as i live with all the business i writ to 's holiness nay then farewell i have touched the highest point of all my greatness and from that full meridian of my glory i haste now to my setting i shall fall like a bright exhalation in the evening and no man see me more stay where's your commission lords words cannot carry authority so weighty till i find more than will or words to do it  i mean your malice know officious lords i dare and must deny it now i feel of what coarse metal you are molded envy how eagerly you follow my disgraces as if it fed you and how sleek and wanton you appear in everything may bring my ruin follow your envious courses men of malice you have christian warrant for 'em and no doubt in time will find their fit rewards that seal you ask with such a violence the king mine and your master with his own hand gave me bade me enjoy it with the place and honors during my life and to confirm his goodness tied it by letters patents now who'll take it it must be himself then proud lord thou liest within these forty hours surrey durst better have burnt that tongue than said so this and all else this talking lord can lay upon my credit i answer is most false the duke by law found his deserts how innocent i was from any private malice in his end his noble jury and foul cause can witness  if i loved many words lord i should tell you you have as little honesty as honor that in the way of loyalty and truth toward the king my ever royal master dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be and all that love his follies all goodness is poison to thy stomach how much methinks i could despise this man but that i am bound in charity against it so much fairer and spotless shall mine innocence arise when the king knows my truth speak on sir i dare your worst objections if i blush it is to see a nobleman want manners so farewell to the little good you bear me farewell a long farewell to all my greatness this is the state of man today he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honors thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is a ripening nips his root and then he falls as i do i have ventured like little wanton boys that swim on bladders this many summers in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth my high blown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must forever hide me vain pomp and glory of this world i hate you i feel my heart new opened o how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin more pangs and fears than wars or women have and when he falls he falls like lucifer never to hope again why how now cromwell what amazed at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline nay an you weep i am fall'n indeed why well never so truly happy my good cromwell i know myself now and i feel within me a peace above all earthly dignities a still and quiet conscience the king has cured me  i humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders these ruined pillars out of pity taken a load would sink a navy too much honor o 'tis a burden cromwell 'tis a burden too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven i hope i have i am able now methinks out of a fortitude of soul i feel to endure more miseries and greater far than my weak hearted enemies dare offer what news abroad god bless him that's somewhat sudden but he's a learn\u00e8d man may he continue long in his highness' favor and do justice for truth's sake and his conscience that his bones when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings may have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on him what more that's news indeed there was the weight that pulled me down o cromwell the king has gone beyond me all my glories in that one woman i have lost forever no sun shall ever usher forth mine honors or gild again the noble troops that waited upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell i am a poor fall'n man unworthy now to be thy lord and master seek the king that sun i pray may never set i have told him what and how true thou art he will advance thee some little memory of me will stir him  i know his noble nature not to let thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell neglect him not make use now and provide for thine own future safety cromwell i did not think to shed a tear in all my miseries but thou hast forced me out of thy honest truth to play the woman let's dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell and when i am forgotten as i shall be and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention of me more must be heard of say i taught thee say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory and sounded all the depths and shoals of honor found thee a way out of his wrack to rise in a sure and safe one though thy master missed it mark but my fall and that that ruined me cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition by that sin fell the angels how can man then the image of his maker hope to win by it love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee corruption wins not more than honesty still in thy right hand carry gentle peace to silence envious tongues be just and fear not let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's thy god's and truth's then if thou fall'st o cromwell thou fall'st a bless\u00e8d martyr serve the king and prithee lead me in there take an inventory of all i have to the last penny 'tis the king's my robe and my integrity to heaven is all i dare now call mine own o cromwell cromwell had i but served my god with half the zeal i served my king he would not in mine age have left me naked to mine enemies so i have farewell the hopes of court

eating canker dwells so eating love inhabits in the finest wits of all and thither will i bring thee valentine all happiness bechance to thee in milan he after honor hunts i after love he leaves his friends to dignify them more i leave myself my friends and all for love thou julia thou hast metamorphosed me made me neglect my studies lose my time war with good counsel set the world at nought made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought but now he parted hence to embark for milan indeed a sheep doth very often stray an if the shepherd be awhile away i do a silly answer and fitting well a

said she nothing go go begone to save your ship from wrack which cannot perish having thee aboard being destined to a drier death on shore i must go send some better messenger i fear my julia would not deign my lines receiving them from such a worthless post sweet love sweet lines sweet life here is her hand the agent of her heart here is her oath for love her honor's pawn o that our fathers would applaud our loves to seal our happiness with their consents o heavenly julia may 't please your lordship 'tis a word or two of commendations sent from valentine delivered by a friend that came from him there is no news my lord but that he writes how happily he lives how well beloved and daily grac\u00e8d by the emperor wishing me with him partner of his fortune as one relying on your lordship's will and not depending on his friendly wish my lord i cannot be so soon provided please you deliberate a day or two thus have i shunned the fire for fear of burning and drenched me in the sea where i am drowned i feared to show my father julia's letter lest he should take exceptions to my love and with the vantage of mine own excuse hath he excepted most against my love o how this spring of love resembleth the uncertain glory of an april day which now shows all the beauty of the sun and by and by a cloud takes all away why this it is my heart accords thereto and yet a thousand times it answers no have patience gentle julia when possibly i can i will return why then we'll make exchange here take you this here is my hand for my true constancy and when that hour o'erslips me in the day wherein i sigh not julia for thy sake the next ensuing hour some foul mischance torment me for my love's forgetfulness my father stays my coming answer not the tide is now nay not thy tide of tears that tide will stay me longer than i should julia farewell what gone without a word ay so true love should do it cannot speak for truth hath better deeds than words to grace it go i come i come alas this parting strikes poor lovers dumb not so sweet lady but too mean a servant to have a look of such a worthy mistress my duty will i boast of nothing else i'll die on him that says so but yourself that you are worthless we'll both attend upon your ladyship your friends are well and have them much commended i left them all in health my tales of love were wont to weary you i know you joy not in a love discourse enough i read your fortune in your eye was this the idol that you worship so no but she is an earthly paragon i will not flatter her when i was sick you gave me bitter pills and i must minister the like to you except my mistress have i not reason to prefer mine own why valentine what braggartism is this then let her alone but she loves you go on before i shall inquire you forth i must unto the road to disembark some necessaries that i needs must use and then i'll presently attend you i will even as one heat another heat expels or as one nail by strength drives out another so the remembrance of my former love is by a newer object quite forgotten is it mine eye or valentine's praise her true perfection or my false transgression that makes me reasonless to reason thus she is fair and so is julia that i love  that i did love for now my love is thawed which like a waxen image 'gainst a fire bears no impression of the thing it was methinks my zeal to valentine is cold and that i love him not as i was wont o but i love his lady too too much and that's the reason i love him so little how shall i dote on her with more advice that thus without advice begin to love her 'tis but her picture i have yet beheld and that hath dazzled my reason's light but when i look on her perfections there is no reason but i shall be blind if i can check my erring love i will if not to compass her i'll use my skill to leave my julia shall i be forsworn to love fair sylvia shall i be forsworn to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn and ev'n that power which gave me first my oath provokes me to this threefold perjury love bade me swear and love bids me forswear o sweet suggesting love if thou hast sinned teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it at first i did adore a twinkling star but now i worship a celestial sun unheedful vows may heedfully be broken and he wants wit that wants resolv\u00e8d will to learn his wit t' exchange the bad for better fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferred with twenty thousand soul confirming oaths i cannot leave to love and yet i do but there i leave to love where i should love julia i lose and valentine i lose if i keep them i needs must lose myself if i lose them thus find i by their loss for valentine myself for julia sylvia i to myself am dearer than a friend for love is still most precious in itself and sylvia witness heaven that made her fair  shows julia but a swarthy ethiope i will forget that julia is alive rememb'ring that my love to her is dead and valentine i'll hold an enemy aiming at sylvia as a sweeter friend i cannot now prove constant to myself without some treachery used to valentine this night he meaneth with a corded ladder to climb celestial sylvia's chamber window myself in counsel his competitor now presently i'll give her father notice of their disguising and pretended flight who all enraged will banish valentine for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter but valentine being gone i'll quickly cross by some sly trick blunt thurio's dull proceeding love lend me wings to make my purpose swift as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift my gracious lord that which i would discover the law of friendship bids me to conceal but when i call to mind your gracious favors done to me undeserving as i am my duty pricks me on to utter that which else no worldly good should draw from me know worthy prince sir valentine my friend this night intends to steal away your daughter myself am one made privy to the plot i know you have determined to bestow her on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates and should she thus be stol'n away from you it would be much vexation to your age thus for my duty's sake i rather chose to cross my friend in his intended drift than by concealing it heap on your head a pack of sorrows which would press you down being unprevented to your timeless grave know noble lord they have devised a mean how he her chamber window will ascend and with a corded ladder fetch her down for which the youthful lover now is gone and this way comes he with it presently where if it please you you may intercept him but good my lord do it so cunningly that my discovery be not aim\u00e8d at for love of you not hate unto my friend hath made me publisher of this pretense adieu my lord sir valentine is coming run boy run run and seek him out what seest thou valentine who then his spirit what then who wouldst thou strike villain forbear sirrah i say forbear friend valentine a word then in dumb silence will i bury mine for they are harsh untunable and bad no valentine no valentine that thou art banish\u00e8d o that's the news  from hence from sylvia and from me thy friend ay ay and she hath offered to the doom  which unreversed stands in effectual force  a sea of melting pearl which some call tears those at her father's churlish feet she tendered with them upon her knees her humble self wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them as if but now they wax\u00e8d pale for woe but neither bended knees pure hands held up sad sighs deep groans nor silver shedding tears could penetrate her uncompassionate sire but valentine if he be ta'en must die besides her intercession chafed him so when she for thy repeal was suppliant that to close prison he commanded her with many bitter threats of biding there cease to lament for that thou canst not help and study help for that which thou lament'st time is the nurse and breeder of all good here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love besides thy staying will abridge thy life hope is a lover's staff walk hence with that and manage it against despairing thoughts thy letters may be here though thou art hence which being writ to me shall be delivered even in the milk white bosom of thy love the time now serves not to expostulate come i'll convey thee through the city gate and ere i part with thee confer at large of all that may concern thy love affairs as thou lov'st sylvia though not for thyself regard thy danger and along with me go sirrah find him out come valentine gone my good lord a little time my lord will kill that grief longer than i prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace i do my lord she did my lord when valentine was here the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood cowardice and poor descent three things that women highly hold in hate ay if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend and that my lord i shall be loath to do 'tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend you have prevailed my lord if i can do it by aught that i can speak in his dispraise she shall not long continue love to him but say this weed her love from valentine it follows not that she will love sir thurio as much as i can do i will effect  but you sir thurio are not sharp enough you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets whose compos\u00e8d rhymes should be full fraught with serviceable vows say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart

after supper and afterward determine our proceedings already have i been false to valentine and now i must be as unjust to thurio under the color of commending him i have access my own love to prefer but sylvia is too fair too true too holy to be corrupted with my worthless gifts when i protest true loyalty to her she twits me with my falsehood to my friend when to her beauty i commend my vows she bids me think how i have been forsworn in breaking faith with julia whom i loved and notwithstanding all her sudden quips the least whereof would quell a lover's hope yet spaniel like the more she spurns my love the more it grows and fawneth on her still but here comes thurio now must we to her window and give some evening music to her ear ay gentle thurio for you know that love will creep in

here pronounce by th' very truth of it i care not for you and am so near the lack of charity to accuse myself i hate you which i had rather you felt than make 't my boast profane fellow wert thou the son of jupiter and no more but what thou art besides thou wert too base to be his groom thou wert dignified enough even to the point of envy if 'twere made comparative for your virtues to be styled the under hangman of his kingdom and hated for being preferred so well he never can meet more mischance than come to be but named of thee his mean'st garment that ever hath but clipped his body is dearer in my respect than all the hairs above thee were they all made such men how now pisanio to dorothy my woman hie thee presently i am sprighted with a fool frighted and angered worse go bid my woman search for a jewel that too casually hath left mine arm it was thy master's shrew me if i would lose it for a revenue of any king's in europe i do think i saw 't this morning confident i am last night 'twas on mine arm i kissed it i hope it be not gone to tell my lord that i kiss aught but he i hope so go and search ay i said so sir if you will make 't an action call witness to 't your mother too she's my good lady and will conceive i hope but the worst of me so i leave you sir to th' worst of discontent how now pisanio who thy lord that is my lord leonatus o learned indeed were that astronomer that knew the stars as i his characters he'd lay the future open you good gods let what is here contained relish of love of my lord's health of his content yet not that we two are asunder let that grieve him some griefs are med'cinable that is one of them for it doth physic love of his content all but in that good wax thy leave blest be you bees that make these locks of counsel lovers and men in dangerous bonds pray not alike though forfeiters you cast in prison yet you clasp young cupid's tables good news gods justice and your father's wrath should he take me in his dominion could not be so cruel to me as you o the dearest of creatures would even renew me with your eyes take notice that i am in cambria at milford haven what your own love will out of this advise you follow so he wishes you all happiness that remains loyal to his vow and your increasing in love leonatus posthumus o for a horse with wings hear'st thou pisanio he is at milford haven read and tell me how far 'tis thither if one of mean affairs may plod it in a week why may not i glide thither in a day then true pisanio who long'st like me to see thy lord who long'st  o let me bate but not like me yet long'st but in a fainter kind o not like me for mine's beyond beyond say and speak thick  love's counselor should fill the bores of hearing to th' smothering of the sense how far it is to this same bless\u00e8d milford and by th' way tell me how wales was made so happy as t' inherit such a haven but first of all how we may steal from hence and for the gap that we shall make in time from our hence going and our return to excuse but first how get hence why should excuse be born or ere begot we'll talk of that hereafter prithee speak how many score of miles may we well rid 'twixt hour and hour why one that rode to 's execution man could never go so slow i have heard of riding wagers where horses have been nimbler than the sands that run i' th' clock's behalf but this is fool'ry go bid my woman feign a sickness say she'll home to her father and provide me presently a riding suit no costlier than would fit a franklin's huswife i see before me man nor here nor here nor what ensues but have a fog in them that i cannot look through away i prithee do as i bid thee there's no more to say accessible is none but milford way thou told'st me when we came from horse the place was near at hand ne'er longed my mother so to see me first as i have now pisanio man where is posthumus what is in thy mind that makes thee stare thus wherefore breaks that sigh from th' inward of thee one but painted thus would be interpreted a thing perplexed beyond self explication put thyself into a havior of less fear ere wildness vanquish my staider senses what's the matter why tender'st thou that paper to me with a look untender if 't be summer news smile to 't before if winterly thou need'st but keep that count'nance still my husband's hand that drug damned italy hath out craftied him and he's at some hard point speak man thy tongue may take off some extremity which to read would be even mortal to me thy mistress pisanio hath played the strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lies bleeding in me i speak not out of weak surmises but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as i expect my revenge that part thou pisanio must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers let thine own hands take away her life i shall give thee opportunity at milford haven she hath my letter for the purpose where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done thou art the pander to her dishonor and equally to me disloyal false to his bed what is it to be false to lie in watch there and to think on him to weep 'twixt clock and clock if sleep charge nature to break it with a fearful dream of him and cry myself awake that's false to 's bed is it i false thy conscience witness iachimo thou didst accuse him of incontinency thou then looked'st like a villain now methinks thy favor's good enough some jay of italy whose mother was her painting hath betrayed him poor i am stale a garment out of fashion and for i am richer than to hang by th' walls i must be ripped to pieces with me o men's vows are women's traitors all good seeming by thy revolt o husband shall be thought put on for villainy not born where 't grows but worn a bait for ladies true honest men being heard like false aeneas were in his time thought false and sinon's weeping did scandal many a holy tear took pity from most true wretchedness so thou posthumus wilt lay the leaven on all proper men goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured from thy great fail come fellow be thou honest do thou thy master's bidding when thou seest him a little witness my obedience look i draw the sword myself take it and hit the innocent mansion of my love my heart fear not 'tis empty of all things but grief thy master is not there who was indeed the riches of it do his bidding strike thou mayst be valiant in a better cause but now thou seem'st a coward why i must die and if i do not by thy hand thou art no servant of thy master's against self slaughter there is a prohibition so divine that cravens my weak hand come here's my heart  something's afore 't soft soft we'll no defense  obedient as the scabbard what is here the scriptures of the loyal leonatus all turned to heresy away away corrupters of my faith you shall no more be stomachers to my heart thus may poor fools believe false teachers though those that are betrayed do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor stands in worse case of woe and thou posthumus that didst set up my disobedience 'gainst the king my father and make me put into contempt the suits of princely fellows shalt hereafter find it is no act of common passage but a strain of rareness and i grieve myself to think when thou shalt be disedged by her that now thou tirest on how thy memory will then be panged by me prithee dispatch the lamb entreats the butcher where's thy knife thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding when i desire it too do 't and to bed then wherefore then didst undertake it why hast thou abused so many miles with a pretense this place mine action and thine own our horses' labor the time inviting thee the perturbed court for my being absent whereunto i never purpose return why hast thou gone so far to be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand th' elected deer before thee talk thy tongue weary speak i have heard i am a strumpet and mine ear therein false struck can take no greater wound nor tent to bottom that but speak most like bringing me here to kill me some roman courtesan why good fellow what shall i do the while where bide how live or in my life what comfort when i am dead to my husband no court no father nor no more ado with that harsh noble simple nothing that cloten whose love suit hath been to me as fearful as a siege where then hath britain all the sun that shines day night are they not but in britain i' th' world's volume our britain seems as of it but not in 't in a great pool a swan's nest prithee think there's livers out of britain o for such means though peril to my modesty not death on 't i would adventure nay be brief i see into thy end and am almost a man already thou art all the comfort the gods will diet me with prithee away there's more to be considered but we'll even all that good time will give us this attempt i am soldier to and will abide it with a prince's courage away i prithee amen i thank thee i see a man's life is a tedious one i have tired myself and for two nights together have made the ground my bed i should be sick but that my resolution helps me milford when from the mountain top pisanio showed thee thou wast within a ken o jove i think foundations fly the wretched such i mean where they should be relieved two beggars told me i could not miss my way will poor folks lie that have afflictions on them knowing 'tis a punishment or trial yes no wonder when rich ones scarce tell true to lapse in fullness is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood is worse in kings than beggars my dear lord thou art one o' th' false ones now i think on thee my hunger's gone but even before i was at point to sink for food but what is this here is a path to 't 'tis some savage hold i were best not call i dare not call yet famine ere clean it o'erthrow nature makes it valiant plenty and peace breeds cowards hardness ever of hardiness is mother ho who's here if anything that's civil speak if savage take or lend ho no answer then i'll enter best draw my sword an if mine enemy but fear the sword like me he'll scarcely look on 't such a foe good heavens good masters harm me not before i entered here i called and thought to have begged or bought what i have took good troth i have stol'n naught nor would not though i had found gold strewed i' th' floor here's money for my meat i would have left it on the board so soon as i had made my meal and parted with prayers for the provider i see you're angry know if you kill me for my fault i should have died had i not made it to milford haven fidele sir i have a kinsman who is bound for italy he embarked at milford to whom being going almost spent with hunger i am fall'n in this offense 'mongst friends if brothers would it had been so that they had been my father's sons then had my prize been less and so more equal ballasting to thee posthumus great men that had a court no bigger than this cave that did attend themselves and had the virtue which their own conscience sealed them laying by that nothing gift of differing multitudes could not outpeer these twain pardon me gods i'd change my sex to be companion with them since leonatus false thanks sir so man and man should be but clay and clay differs in dignity whose dust is both alike i am very sick so sick i am not yet i am not well but not so citizen a wanton as to seem to die ere sick so please you leave me stick to your journal course the breach of custom is breach of all i am ill but your being by me cannot amend me society is no comfort to one not sociable i am not very sick since i can reason of it pray you trust me here  i'll rob none but myself and let me die stealing so poorly i wish you sport these are kind creatures gods what lies i have heard our courtiers say all's savage but at court experience o thou disprov'st report th' imperious seas breeds monsters for the dish poor tributary rivers as sweet fish i am sick still heart sick pisanio i'll now taste of thy drug well or ill i am bound to you yes sir to milford haven which is the way i thank you by yond bush pray how far thither ods pittikins can it be six mile yet i have gone all night faith i'll lie down and sleep but soft no bedfellow o gods and goddesses these flowers are like the pleasures of the world this bloody man the care on 't i hope i dream for so i thought i was a cave keeper and cook to honest creatures but 'tis not so 'twas but a bolt of nothing shot at nothing which the brain makes of fumes our very eyes are sometimes like our judgments blind good faith i tremble still with fear but if there be yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity as a wren's eye feared gods a part of it the dream's here still even when i wake it is without me as within me not imagined felt a headless man the garments of posthumus i know the shape of 's leg this is his hand his foot mercurial his martial thigh the brawns of hercules but his jovial face  murder in heaven how 'tis gone pisanio all curses madded hecuba gave the greeks

hope they'll pardon it say you sir fidele sir i'll follow sir but first an 't please the gods i'll hide my master from the flies as deep as these poor pickaxes can dig and when with wild wood leaves and weeds i ha' strewed his grave and on it said a century of prayers such as i can twice o'er i'll weep and sigh and leaving so his service follow you so please you entertain me i humbly thank your highness no no alack there's other work in hand i see a thing bitter to me as death your life good master must shuffle for itself he is a roman no more kin to me than i to your highness who being born

post horse up to heaven i'll in to urge his hatred more to clarence with lies well steeled with weighty arguments and if i fail not in my deep intent clarence hath not another day to live which done god take king edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in for then i'll marry warwick's youngest daughter what though i killed her husband and her father the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father the which will i not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto but yet i run before my horse to market clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns when they are gone then must i count my gains stay you that bear the corse and set it down villains set down the corse or by saint paul i'll make a corse of him that disobeys unmannered dog stand thou when i command  advance thy halberd higher than my breast or by saint paul i'll strike thee to my foot and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness sweet saint for charity be not so curst lady you know no rules of charity which renders good for bad blessings for curses but i know none and therefore am no beast more wonderful when angels are so angry vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman of these suppos\u00e8d crimes to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself fairer than tongue can name thee let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself by such despair i should accuse myself say that i slew them not i did not kill your husband nay he is dead and slain by edward's hands i was provok\u00e8d by her sland'rous tongue that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders i grant you the better for the king of heaven that hath him let him thank me that holp to send him thither for he was fitter for that place than earth yes one place else if you will hear me name it your bedchamber so will it madam till i lie with you i know so but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall something into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner your beauty was the cause of that effect  your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom these eyes could not endure that beauty's wrack you should not blemish it if i stood by as all the world is cheer\u00e8d by the sun so i by that it is my day my life curse not thyself fair creature thou art both it is a quarrel most unnatural to be revenged on him that loveth thee he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband he lives that loves thee better than he could plantagenet the selfsame name but one of better nature here why dost thou spit at me never came poison from so sweet a place thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears shamed their aspects with store of childish drops these eyes which never shed remorseful tear  no when my father york and edward wept to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when black faced clifford shook his sword at him nor when thy warlike father like a child told the sad story of my father's death and twenty times made pause to sob and weep that all the standers by had wet their cheeks like trees bedashed with rain in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is proposed my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made for kissing lady not for such contempt if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive lo here i lend thee this sharp pointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true breast and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee nay do not pause for i did kill king henry  but 'twas thy beauty that provok\u00e8d me nay now dispatch 'twas i that stabbed young edward  but 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on take up the sword again or take up me then bid me kill myself and i will do it that was in thy rage speak it again and even with the word this hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths shalt thou be accessory 'tis figured in my tongue then never was man true say then my peace is made but shall i live in hope vouchsafe to wear this ring look how my ring encompasseth thy finger even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart wear both of them for both of them are thine and if thy poor devoted servant may but beg one favor at thy gracious hand thou dost confirm his happiness forever that it may please you leave these sad designs to him that hath most cause to be a mourner and presently repair to crosby house where after i have solemnly interred at chertsey monast'ry this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears i will with all expedient duty see you for divers unknown reasons i beseech you grant me this boon bid me farewell no to whitefriars there attend my coming was ever woman in this humor wooed was ever woman in this humor won i'll have her but i will not keep her long what i that killed her husband and his father to take her in her heart's extremest hate with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes the bleeding witness of my hatred by having god her conscience and these bars against me and i no friends to back my suit at all but the plain devil and dissembling looks and yet to win her all the world to nothing ha hath she forgot already that brave prince edward her lord whom i some three months since stabbed in my angry mood at tewkesbury a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman framed in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal the spacious world cannot again afford and will she yet abase her eyes on me that cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woeful bed on me whose all not equals edward's moiety on me that halts and am misshapen thus my dukedom to a beggarly denier i do mistake my person all this while upon my life she finds although i cannot myself to be a marv'lous proper man i'll be at charges for a looking glass and entertain a score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body since i am crept in favor with myself i will maintain it with some little cost but first i'll turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass that i may see my shadow as i pass they do me wrong and i will not endure it who is it that complains unto the king that i forsooth am stern and love them not by holy paul they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumors because i cannot flatter and look fair smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog duck with french nods and apish courtesy i must be held a rancorous enemy cannot a plain man live and think no harm but thus his simple truth must be abused with silken sly insinuating jacks to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace when have i injured thee when done thee wrong  or thee or thee or any of your faction a plague upon you all his royal grace whom god preserve better than you would wish cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while but you must trouble him with lewd complaints i cannot tell the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch since every jack became a gentleman there's many a gentle person made a jack meantime god grants that we have need of you our brother is imprisoned by your means myself disgraced and the nobility held in contempt while great promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble you may deny that you were not the mean of my lord hastings' late imprisonment she may lord rivers why who knows not so she may do more sir than denying that she may help you to many fair preferments and then deny her aiding hand therein and lay those honors on your high desert what may she not she may ay marry may she  what marry may she marry with a king a bachelor and a handsome stripling too iwis your grandam had a worser match what threat you me with telling of the king tell him and spare not look what i have said i will avouch 't in presence of the king i dare adventure to be sent to th' tower 'tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot ere you were queen ay or your husband king i was a packhorse in his great affairs a weeder out of his proud adversaries a liberal rewarder of his friends to royalize his blood i spent mine own in all which time you and your husband grey were factious for the house of lancaster  and rivers so were you was not your husband in margaret's battle at saint albans slain let me put in your minds if you forget what you have been ere this and what you are withal what i have been and what i am poor clarence did forsake his father warwick ay and forswore himself which jesu pardon  to fight on edward's party for the crown and for his meed poor lord he is mewed up i would to god my heart were flint like edward's or edward's soft and pitiful like mine i am too childish foolish for this world if i should be i had rather be a peddler far be it from my heart the thought thereof foul wrinkled witch what mak'st thou in my sight wert thou not banish\u00e8d on pain of death the curse my noble father laid on thee when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper and with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes and then to dry them gav'st the duke a clout steeped in the faultless blood of pretty rutland  his curses then from bitterness of soul denounced against thee are all fall'n upon thee and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed have done thy charm thou hateful withered hag margaret ha i cry thee mercy then for i did think that thou hadst called me all these bitter names 'tis done by me and ends in margaret good counsel marry learn it learn it marquess ay and much more but i was born so high our aerie buildeth in the cedar's top and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun what doth she say my lord of buckingham i cannot blame her by god's holy mother she hath had too much wrong and i repent my part thereof that i have done to her yet you have all the vantage of her wrong i was too hot to do somebody good that is too cold in thinking of it now marry as for clarence he is well repaid he is franked up to fatting for his pains god pardon them that are the cause thereof so do i ever being well advised for had i cursed now i had cursed myself i do the wrong and first begin to brawl the secret mischiefs that i set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others clarence who i indeed have cast in darkness i do beweep to many simple gulls namely to derby hastings buckingham and tell them 'tis the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke my brother now they believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on rivers dorset grey but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that god bids us do good for evil and thus i clothe my naked villainy with odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil but soft here come my executioners  how now my hardy stout resolv\u00e8d mates are you now going to dispatch this thing well thought upon i have it here about me when you have done repair to crosby place but sirs be sudden in the execution withal obdurate do not hear him plead for clarence is well spoken and perhaps may move your hearts to pity if you mark him your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall tears i like you lads about your business straight go go dispatch good morrow to my sovereign king and queen and princely peers a happy time of day a bless\u00e8d labor my most sovereign lord among this princely heap if any here by false intelligence or wrong surmise hold me a foe if i unwittingly or in my rage have aught committed that is hardly borne by any in this presence i desire to reconcile me to his friendly peace 'tis death to me to be at enmity i hate it and desire all good men's love first madam i entreat true peace of you which i will purchase with my duteous service  of you my noble cousin buckingham if ever any grudge were lodged between us  of you and you lord rivers and of dorset that all without desert have frowned on me  of you lord woodeville and lord scales of you dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all i do not know that englishman alive with whom my soul is any jot at odds more than the infant that is born tonight i thank my god for my humility why madam have i offered love for this to be so flouted in this royal presence who knows not that the gentle duke is dead you do him injury to scorn his corse but he poor man by your first order died and that a wing\u00e8d mercury did bear some tardy cripple bare the countermand that came too lag to see him buri\u00e8d god grant that some less noble and less loyal nearer in bloody thoughts and not in blood deserve not worse than wretched clarence did and yet go current from suspicion this is the fruits of rashness marked you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen looked pale when they did hear of clarence' death o they did urge it still unto the king god will revenge it come lords will you go to comfort edward with our company sister have comfort all of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star but none can help our harms by wailing them  madam my mother i do cry you mercy i did not see your grace humbly on my knee i crave your blessing amen and make me die a good old man that is the butt end of a mother's blessing i marvel that her grace did leave it out i hope the king made peace with all of us and the compact is firm and true in me then be it so and go we to determine who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow  madam and you my sister will you go to give your censures in this business my other self my council's consistory my oracle my prophet my dear cousin i as a child will go by thy direction toward ludlow then for we'll not stay behind welcome dear cousin my thoughts' sovereign the weary way hath made you melancholy sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years hath not yet dived into the world's deceit nor more can you distinguish of a man than of his outward show which god he knows seldom or never jumpeth with the heart those uncles which you want were dangerous your grace attended to their sugared words but looked not on the poison of their hearts god keep you from them and from such false friends my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you where it seems best unto your royal self if i may counsel you some day or two your highness shall repose you at the tower then where you please and shall be thought most fit for your best health and recreation so wise so young they say do never live long i say without characters fame lives long thus like the formal vice iniquity i moralize two meanings in one word short summers lightly have a forward spring how fares our cousin noble lord of york he hath my lord o my fair cousin i must not say so he may command me as my sovereign but you have power in me as in a kinsman my dagger little cousin with all my heart a greater gift than that i'll give my cousin ay gentle cousin were it light enough it is too heavy for your grace to wear what would you have my weapon little lord how my lord will 't please you pass along myself and my good cousin buckingham will to your mother to entreat of her to meet you at the tower and welcome you why what should you fear nor none that live i hope no doubt no doubt o 'tis a parlous boy bold quick ingenious forward capable he is all the mother's from the top to toe commend me to lord william tell him catesby his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries tomorrow are let blood at pomfret castle and bid my lord for joy of this good news give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep at crosby house there shall you find us both chop off his head something we will determine and look when i am king claim thou of me the earldom of hereford and all the movables whereof the king my brother was possessed and look to have it yielded with all kindness come let us sup betimes that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form my noble lords and cousins all good morrow i have been long a sleeper but i trust my absence doth neglect no great design which by my presence might have been concluded than my lord hastings no man might be bolder his lordship knows me well and loves me well  my lord of ely when i was last in holborn i saw good strawberries in your garden there i do beseech you send for some of them cousin of buckingham a word with you catesby hath sounded hastings in our business and finds the testy gentleman so hot that he will lose his head ere give consent his master's child as worshipfully he terms it shall lose the royalty of england's throne i pray you all tell me what they deserve that do conspire my death with devilish plots of damn\u00e8d witchcraft and that have prevailed upon my body with their hellish charms then be your eyes the witness of their evil look how i am bewitched behold mine arm is like a blasted sapling withered up and this is edward's wife that monstrous witch consorted with that harlot strumpet shore that by their witchcraft thus have mark\u00e8d me if thou protector of this damn\u00e8d strumpet talk'st thou to me of ifs thou art a traitor  off with his head now by saint paul i swear i will not dine until i see the same  lovell and ratcliffe look that it be done  the rest that love me rise and follow me come cousin canst thou quake and change thy color murder thy breath in middle of a word and then again begin and stop again as if thou were distraught and mad with terror he is and see he brings the mayor along look to the drawbridge there catesby o'erlook the walls look back defend thee here are enemies be patient they are friends ratcliffe and lovell so dear i loved the man that i must weep i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathed upon the earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts so smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted  i mean his conversation with shore's wife  he lived from all attainder of suspects what think you we are turks or infidels or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly in the villain's death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons' safety enforced us to this execution and to that end we wished your lordship here t' avoid the censures of the carping world go after after cousin buckingham the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post there at your meetest vantage of the time infer the bastardy of edward's children tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown meaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was term\u00e8d so moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretched unto their servants daughters wives even where his raging eye or savage heart without control lusted to make a prey nay for a need thus far come near my person tell them when that my mother went with child of that insatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by true computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appear\u00e8d in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father yet touch this sparingly as 'twere far off because my lord you know my mother lives if you thrive well bring them to baynard's castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well learn\u00e8d bishops go lovell with all speed to doctor shaa go thou to friar penker bid them both meet me within this hour at baynard's castle now will i go to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give order that no manner person have any time recourse unto the princes how now how now what say the citizens touched you the bastardy of edward's children and did they so what tongueless blocks were they would they not speak will not the mayor then and his brethren come i go an if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt we bring it to a happy issue my lord there needs no such apology i do beseech your grace to pardon me who earnest in the service of my god deferred the visitation of my friends but leaving this what is your grace's pleasure i do suspect i have done some offense that seems disgracious in the city's eye and that you come to reprehend my ignorance else wherefore breathe i in a christian land i cannot tell if to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think tongue tied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so seasoned with your faithful love to me then on the other side i checked my friends therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as the ripe revenue and due of birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects that i would rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapor of my glory smothered but god be thanked there is no need of me and much i need to help you were there need the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellowed by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign on him i lay that you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him alas why would you heap this care on me i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you o do not swear my lord of buckingham will you enforce me to a world of cares call them again i am not made of stones but penetrable to your kind entreaties albeit against my conscience and my soul cousin of buckingham and sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burden whe'er i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foul faced reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god doth know and you may partly see how far i am from the desire of this in saying so you shall but say the truth even when you please for you will have it so come let us to our holy work again  farewell my cousin farewell gentle friends stand all apart cousin of buckingham give me thy hand thus high by thy advice and thy assistance is king richard seated but shall we wear these glories for a day or shall they last and we rejoice in them ah buckingham now do i play the touch to try if thou be current gold indeed young edward lives think now what i would speak why buckingham i say i would be king ha am i king 'tis so but edward lives o bitter consequence that edward still should live true noble prince cousin thou wast not wont to be so dull shall i be plain i wish the bastards dead and i would have it suddenly performed what sayst thou now speak suddenly be brief tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezes say have i thy consent that they shall die i will converse with iron witted fools and unrespective boys none are for me that look into me with considerate eyes high reaching buckingham grows circumspect  boy know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold will tempt unto a close exploit of death what is his name i partly know the man go call him hither boy the deep revolving witty buckingham no more shall be the neighbor to my counsels hath he so long held out with me untired and stops he now for breath well be it so how now lord stanley what's the news come hither catesby rumor it abroad that anne my wife is very grievous sick i will take order for her keeping close inquire me out some mean poor gentleman whom i will marry straight to clarence' daughter the boy is foolish and i fear not him look how thou dream'st i say again give out that anne my queen is sick and like to die about it for it stands me much upon to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me i must be married to my brother's daughter or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass murder her brothers and then marry her  uncertain way of gain but i am in so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin tear falling pity dwells not in this eye is thy name tyrrel art thou indeed dar'st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine why then thou hast it two deep enemies foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers are they that i would have thee deal upon tyrrel i mean those bastards in the tower thou sing'st sweet music hark come hither tyrrel go by this token rise and lend thine ear there is no more but so say it is done and i will love thee and prefer thee for it well let that rest dorset is fled to richmond stanley he is your wife's son well look unto it stanley look to your wife if she convey letters to richmond you shall answer it i do remember me henry the sixth did prophesy that richmond should be king when richmond was a little peevish boy a king perhaps  how chance the prophet could not at that time have told me i being by that i should kill him richmond when last i was at exeter the mayor in courtesy showed me the castle and called it rougemont at which name i started because a bard of ireland told me once i should not live long after i saw richmond ay what's o'clock well but what's o'clock well let it strike because that like a jack thou keep'st the stroke betwixt thy begging and my meditation i am not in the giving vein today thou troublest me i am not in the vein kind tyrrel am i happy in thy news but did'st thou see them dead and buried gentle tyrrel come to me tyrrel soon at after supper when thou shalt tell the process of their death meantime but think how i may do thee good and be inheritor of thy desire farewell till then the son of clarence

at young elizabeth my brother's daughter and by that knot looks proudly on the crown to her go i a jolly thriving wooer good or bad news that thou com'st in so bluntly ely with richmond troubles me

the birds of prey and let it keep one shape till custom make it their perch and not their terror 'tis one thing to be tempted escalus another thing to fall i not deny the jury passing on the

evil if the first that did th' edict infringe had answered for his deed now 'tis awake takes note of what is done and like a prophet looks in a glass that shows what future evils  either now or by remissness new conceived and so in progress to be hatched and born  are now to have no successive degrees but ere they live to end i show it most of all when i show justice for then i pity those i do not know which a dismissed offense would after gall and do him right that answering one foul wrong lives not to act another be satisfied your brother dies tomorrow be content why do you put these sayings upon me she speaks and 'tis such sense that my sense breeds with it fare you well i will bethink me come again tomorrow how bribe me well come to me tomorrow amen for i am that way going to temptation where prayers cross at any time 'fore noon from thee even from thy virtue what's this what's this is this her fault or mine the tempter or the tempted who sins most ha not she nor doth she tempt but it is i that lying by the violet in the sun do as the carrion does not as the flower corrupt with virtuous season can it be that modesty may more betray our sense than woman's lightness having waste ground enough shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie what dost thou or what art thou angelo dost thou desire her foully for those things that make her good o let her brother live thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves what do i love her that i desire to hear her speak again and feast upon her eyes what is 't i dream on o cunning enemy that to catch a saint with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet with all her double vigor art and nature once stir my temper but this virtuous maid subdues me quite ever till now when men were fond i smiled and wondered how when i would pray and think i think and pray to several subjects heaven hath my empty words whilst my invention hearing not my tongue anchors on isabel god in my mouth as if i did but only chew his name and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception the state whereon i studied is like a good thing being often read grown sere and tedious yea my gravity wherein let no man hear me i take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain o place o form how often dost thou with thy case thy habit wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming blood thou art blood let's write good angel on the devil's horn 'tis not the devil's crest how now who's there teach her the way o heavens why does my blood thus muster to my heart making both it unable for itself and dispossessing all my other parts of necessary fitness so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons come all to help him and so stop the air by which he should revive and even so the general subject to a well wished king quit their own part and in obsequious fondness crowd to his presence where their untaught love must needs appear offense how now fair maid that you might know it would much better please me than to demand what 'tis your brother cannot live yet may he live a while and it may be as long as you or i yet he must die yea ha fie these filthy vices it were as good to pardon him that hath from nature stolen a man already made as to remit their saucy sweetness that do coin god's image in stamps that are forbid 'tis all as easy falsely to take away a life true made as to put metal in restrain\u00e8d means to make a false one say you so then i shall pose you quickly which had you rather that the most just law now took your brother's life or to redeem him give up your body to such sweet uncleanness as she that he hath stained i talk not of your soul our compelled sins stand more for number than for accompt nay i'll not warrant that for i can speak against the thing i say answer to this i now the voice of the recorded law pronounce a sentence on your brother's life might there not be a charity in sin to save this brother's life pleased you to do 't at peril of your soul were equal poise of sin and charity nay but hear me your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant or seem so crafty and that's not good thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright when it doth tax itself as these black masks proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder than beauty could displayed but mark me to be receiv\u00e8d plain i'll speak more gross your brother is to die and his offense is so as it appears accountant to the law upon that pain admit no other way to save his life  as i subscribe not that nor any other  but in the loss of question that you his sister finding yourself desired of such a person whose credit with the judge or own great place could fetch your brother from the manacles of the law and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed or else to let him suffer what would you do then must your brother die were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slandered so you seemed of late to make the law a tyrant and rather proved the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice we are all frail nay women are frail too i think it well and from this testimony of your own sex since i suppose we are made to be no stronger than faults may shake our frames let me be bold i do arrest your words be that you are  that is a woman if you be more you're none if you be one as you are well

purpose who will believe thee isabel my unsoiled name th' austereness of my life my vouch against you and my place i' th' state will so your accusation overweigh that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny i have begun and now i give my sensual race the rein fit thy consent to my sharp appetite lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will or else he must not only die the death but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to ling'ring sufferance answer me tomorrow or by the affection that now guides me most i'll prove a tyrant to him as for you say what you can my false o'erweighs your true in most uneven and distracted manner his actions show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted and why meet him at the gates and deliver our authorities there and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the street well i beseech you let it be proclaimed betimes i' th' morn i'll call you at your house give notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet him good night this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant and dull to all proceedings a deflowered maid and by an eminent body that enforced the law against it but that her tender shame will not proclaim against her maiden loss how might she tongue me yet reason dares her no for my authority bears of a credent bulk that no particular scandal once can touch but it confounds the breather he should have lived save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense might in the times to come have ta'en revenge by so receiving a dishonored life with ransom of such shame would yet he had lived alack when once our grace we have forgot nothing goes right we would and we would not happy return be to your royal grace you make my bonds still greater my lord her wits i fear me are not firm she hath been a suitor to me for her brother cut off by course of justice and she will speak most bitterly and strange charges she more than me this is a strange abuse let's see thy face my lord i must confess i know this woman and five years since there was some speech of marriage betwixt myself and her which was broke off partly for that her promis\u00e8d proportions came short of composition but in chief for that her reputation was disvalued in levity since which time of five years i never spake with her saw her nor heard from her upon my faith and honor i did but smile till now now good my lord give me the scope of justice my patience here is touched i do perceive these poor informal women are no more but instruments of some more mightier member that sets them on let me have way my lord to find this practice out what can you vouch against him signior lucio is this the man that you did tell us of hark how the villain would close now after his treasonable abuses what resists he help him lucio o my dread lord i should be guiltier than my guiltiness to think i can be undiscernible when i perceive your grace like power divine hath looked upon my passes then good prince no longer session hold upon my

love in this dost thou not laugh good heart at what why such is love's transgression griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed with more of thine this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs being purged a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes being vexed a sea nourished with loving tears what is it else a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet farewell my coz tut i have lost myself i am not here this is not romeo he's some other where what shall i groan and tell thee a sick man in sadness makes his will  a word ill urged to one that is so ill in sadness cousin i do love a woman a right good markman and she's fair i love well in that hit you miss she'll not be hit with cupid's arrow she hath dian's wit and in strong proof of chastity well armed from love's weak childish bow she lives uncharmed she will not stay the siege of loving terms nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes nor ope her lap to saint seducing gold o she is rich in beauty only poor that when she dies with beauty dies her store she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste for beauty starved with her severity cuts beauty off from all posterity she is too fair too wise wisely too fair to merit bliss by making me despair she hath forsworn to love and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now o teach me how i should forget to think 'tis the way to call hers exquisite in question more these happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows being black puts us in mind they hide the fair he that is strucken blind cannot forget the precious treasure of his eyesight lost show me a mistress that is passing fair what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who passed that passing fair farewell thou canst not teach me to forget your plantain leaf is excellent for that for your broken shin not mad but bound more than a madman is shut up in prison kept without my food whipped and tormented and good e'en good fellow ay mine own fortune in my misery ay if i know the letters and the language stay fellow i can read signior martino and his wife and daughters county anselme and his beauteous sisters the lady widow of vitruvio signior placentio and his lovely nieces mercutio and his brother valentine mine uncle capulet his wife and daughters my fair niece rosaline and livia signior valentio and his cousin tybalt lucio and the lively helena a fair assembly whither should they come whither to supper whose house indeed i should have asked thee that before when the devout religion of mine eye maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fire and these who often drowned could never die transparent heretics be burnt for liars one fairer than my love the all seeing sun ne'er saw her match since first the world begun i'll go along no such sight to be shown but to rejoice in splendor of mine own what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse or shall we on without apology give me a torch i am not for this ambling being but heavy i will bear the light not i believe me you have dancing shoes with nimble soles i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i cannot move i am too sore enpierc\u00e8d with his shaft to soar with his light feathers and so bound i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe under love's heavy burden do i sink is love a tender thing it is too rough too rude too boist'rous and it pricks like thorn a torch for me let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels for i am proverbed with a grandsire phrase i'll be a candle holder and look on the game was ne'er so fair and i am done nay that's not so and we mean well in going to this masque but 'tis no wit to go i dreamt a dream tonight well what was yours in bed asleep while they do dream things true peace peace mercutio peace thou talk'st of nothing i fear too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night's revels and expire the term of a despis\u00e8d life closed in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my sail on lusty gentlemen what lady's that which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight o she doth teach the torches to burn bright it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night as a rich jewel in an ethiop's ear  beauty too rich for use for earth too dear so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows the measure done i'll watch her place of stand and touching hers make bless\u00e8d my rude hand did my heart love till now forswear it sight for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine the gentle sin is this my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss have not saints lips and holy palmers too o then dear saint let lips do what hands do they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair then move not while my prayer's effect i take thus from my lips by thine my sin is purged sin from my lips o trespass sweetly urged give me my sin again what is her mother is she a capulet o dear account my life is my foe's debt ay so i fear the more is my unrest can i go forward when my heart is here turn back dull earth and find thy center out he jests at scars that never felt a wound but soft what light through yonder window breaks it is the east and juliet is the sun arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she be not her maid since she is envious her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it cast it off it is my lady o it is my love o that she knew she were she speaks yet she says nothing what of that her eye discourses i will answer it i am too bold 'tis not to me she speaks two of the fairest stars in all the heaven having some business do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return what if her eyes were there they in her head the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp her eye in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night see how she leans her cheek upon her hand o that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek she speaks o speak again bright angel for thou art as glorious to this night being o'er my head as is a wing\u00e8d messenger of heaven unto the white upturn\u00e8d wond'ring eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air shall i hear more or shall i speak at this i take thee at thy word call me but love and i'll be new baptized henceforth i never will be romeo by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am my name dear saint is hateful to myself because it is an enemy to thee had i it written i would tear the word neither fair maid if either thee dislike with love's light wings did i o'erperch these walls for stony limits cannot hold love out and what love can do that dares love attempt therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me alack there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet and i am proof against their enmity i have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes and but thou love me let them find me here my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogu\u00e8d wanting of thy love by love that first did prompt me to inquire he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes i am no pilot yet wert thou as far as that vast shore washed with the farthest sea i should adventure for such merchandise lady by yonder bless\u00e8d moon i vow that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops  what shall i swear by if my heart's dear love  o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine wouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose love o bless\u00e8d bless\u00e8d night i am afeard being in night all this is but a dream too flattering sweet to be substantial so thrive my soul  a thousand times the

now i have stained the childhood of our joy with blood removed but little from her own where is she and how doth she and what says my concealed lady to our canceled love as if that name shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her as that name's curs\u00e8d hand murdered her kinsman o tell me friar tell me in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name lodge tell me that i may sack the hateful mansion do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide how well my comfort is revived by this but that a joy past joy calls out on me it were a grief so brief to part with thee farewell it was the lark the herald of the morn no nightingale look love what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east night's candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops i must be gone and live or stay and die let me be ta'en let me be put to death i am content so thou wilt have it so i'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye 'tis but the pale reflex of cynthia's brow nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads i have more care to stay than will to go come death and welcome juliet wills it so how is 't my soul let's talk it is not day more light and light more dark and dark our woes farewell farewell one kiss and i'll descend farewell i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings love to thee i doubt it not and all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come and trust me love in my eye so do you dry sorrow drinks our blood adieu adieu if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep my dreams presage some joyful news at hand my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts i dreamt my lady came and found me dead strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor ah me how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadows are so rich in joy news from verona how now balthasar dost thou not bring me letters from the friar how doth my lady is my father well how doth my juliet that i ask again for nothing can be ill if she be well is it e'en so then i deny you stars  thou knowest my lodging get me ink and paper and hire post horses i will hence tonight tush thou art deceived leave me and do the thing i bid thee do hast thou no letters to me from the friar no matter get thee gone and hire those horses i'll be with thee straight well juliet i will lie with thee tonight let's see for means o mischief thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men i do remember an apothecary and hereabouts he dwells which late i noted in tattered weeds with overwhelming brows culling of simples meager were his looks sharp misery had worn him to the bones and in his needy shop a tortoise hung an alligator stuffed and other skins of ill shaped fishes and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses were thinly scattered to make up a show noting this penury to myself i said an if a man did need a poison now whose sale is present death in mantua here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him o this same thought did but forerun my need and this same needy man must sell it me as i remember this should be the house being holiday the beggar's shop is shut  what ho apothecary come hither man i see that thou art poor hold there is forty ducats let me have a dram of poison such soon speeding gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the life weary taker may fall dead and that the trunk may be discharged of breath as violently as hasty powder fired doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb art thou so bare and full of wretchedness and fearest to die famine is in thy cheeks need and oppression starveth in thy eyes contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back the world is not thy friend nor the world's law the world affords no law to make thee rich then be not poor but break it and take this i pay thy poverty and not thy will there is thy gold worse poison to men's souls doing more murder in this loathsome world than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh come cordial and not poison go with me to juliet's grave for there must i use thee give me that mattock and the wrenching iron hold take this letter early in the morning see thou deliver it to my lord and father give me the light upon thy life i charge thee whate'er thou hearest or seest stand all aloof and do not interrupt me in my course why i descend into this bed of death is partly to behold my lady's face but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger a precious ring a ring that i must use in dear employment therefore hence begone but if thou jealous dost return to pry in what i farther shall intend to do by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs the time and my intents are savage wild more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea so shalt thou show me friendship take thou that live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow thou detestable maw thou womb of death gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open and in despite i'll cram thee with more food i must indeed and therefore came i hither good gentle youth tempt not a desp'rate man fly hence and leave me think upon these gone let them affright thee i beseech thee youth put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury o begone by heaven i love thee better than myself for i come hither armed against myself stay not begone live and hereafter say a madman's mercy bid thee run away wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy in faith i will let me peruse this face mercutio's kinsman noble county paris what said my man when my betoss\u00e8d soul did not attend him as we rode i think he told me paris should have married juliet said he not so or did i dream it so or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet to think it was so o give me thy hand one writ with me in sour misfortune's book i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave  a grave o no a lantern slaughtered youth for here lies juliet and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light  death lie thou there by a dead man interred how oft when men are at the point of death have they been merry which their keepers call a light'ning before death o how may i call this a light'ning o my love my wife death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty thou art not conquered beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks and death's pale flag is not advanc\u00e8d there  tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet o what more favor can i do to thee than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy forgive me cousin ah dear juliet why art thou yet so fair shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous and that the lean abhorr\u00e8d monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour for fear of that i still will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night depart again here here will i remain with worms that are thy chambermaids o here will i set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world wearied flesh eyes look your last arms take your last embrace and lips o you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death come bitter conduct come unsavory guide thou desperate pilot now at once run on the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark here's to my love o true apothecary

about an oak with great ragged horns and there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle and makes milch kine yield blood and shakes a chain in a most hideous and dreadful manner you have heard of such a spirit and well you know the superstitious idle headed eld received and did deliver to our age this tale of herne the hunter for a truth that likewise have we thought upon and thus nan page my daughter and my little son and three or four more of their growth we'll dress like urchins aufs and fairies green and white with rounds of waxen tapers on their heads and rattles in their hands upon a sudden as falstaff she and i are newly met let them from forth a sawpit rush at once with some diffus\u00e8d song upon their sight we two in great amazedness will fly then let them all encircle him about and fairy like to pinch the unclean knight and ask him why that hour of fairy revel in their so sacred paths he dares to tread in shape profane the truth being known we'll all present ourselves

at the abuse of falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying my daughter but 'tis no matter better a little chiding than a great deal of heartbreak they are all couched in a pit hard by herne's oak with obscured lights which at the very instant of falstaff's and our meeting they will at once display to the night if he be not amazed he will be mocked if he be amazed he will every way be mocked against such lewdsters and their lechery those that betray them do no treachery alas what noise away away i pray you come hold up the jest no higher  now good sir john how like you windsor

think verily he had been hanged for 't sure as i live he had suffered for 't you shall judge he thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table he had not been there bless the mark a pissing while but all the chamber smelt him out with the dog says one what cur is that says another whip him out says the third hang him up says the duke i having been

know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor men's cottages princes' palaces it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband o me the word choose i may neither choose who i would nor refuse who i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father is it not hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none i pray thee overname them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection ay that's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith he doth nothing but frown as who should say an you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be married to a death's head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these god defend me from these two god made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the neapolitan's a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a cap'ring he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english he is a proper man's picture but alas who can converse with a dumb show how oddly he is suited i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behavior everywhere that he hath a neighborly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast an the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee

i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my father's will i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant them a fair departure yes yes it was bassanio as i think so was he called i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise how now what news if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me come nerissa sirrah go before  whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the door in terms of choice i am not solely led by nice direction of a maiden's eyes besides the lott'ry of my destiny bars me the right of voluntary choosing but if my father had not scanted me and hedged me by his wit to yield myself his wife who wins me by that means i told you yourself renown\u00e8d prince then stood as fair as any comer i have looked on yet for my affection you must take your chance and either not attempt to choose at all or swear before you choose if you choose wrong never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage therefore be advised first forward to the temple after dinner your hazard shall be made go draw aside the curtains and discover the several caskets to this noble prince now make your choice the one of them contains my picture prince if you choose that then i am yours withal there take it prince and if my form lie there then i am yours a gentle riddance draw the curtains go let all of his complexion choose me so behold there stand the caskets noble prince if you choose that wherein i am contained straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized but if you fail without more speech my lord you must be gone from hence immediately to these injunctions everyone doth swear that comes to hazard for my worthless self too long a pause for that which you find there to offend and judge are distinct offices and of oppos\u00e8d natures thus hath the candle singed the moth o these deliberate fools when they do choose they have the wisdom by their wit to lose come draw the curtain nerissa here what would my lord no more i pray thee i am half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee thou spend'st such high day wit in praising him come come nerissa for i long to see quick cupid's post that comes so mannerly i pray you tarry pause a day or two before you hazard for in choosing wrong i lose your company therefore forbear a while there's something tells me but it is not love i would not lose you and you know yourself hate counsels not in such a quality but lest you should not understand me well and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought i would detain you here some month or two before you venture for me i could teach you how to choose right but then i am forsworn so will i never be so may you miss me but if you do you'll make me wish a sin that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes they have o'erlooked me and divided me one half of me is yours the other half yours  mine own i would say but if mine then yours and so all yours o these naughty times puts bars between the owners and their rights and so though yours not yours prove it so let fortune go to hell for it not i i speak too long but 'tis to peize the time to eche it and to draw it out in length to stay you from election upon the rack bassanio then confess what treason there is mingled with your love ay but i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforc\u00e8d do speak anything well then confess and live away then i am locked in one of them if you do love me you will find me out  nerissa and the rest stand all aloof let music sound while he doth make his choice then if he lose he makes a swanlike end fading in music that the comparison may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream and wat'ry deathbed for him he may win and what is music then then music is even as the flourish when true subjects bow to a new crown\u00e8d monarch such it is as are those dulcet sounds in break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear and summon him to marriage now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the sea monster i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives with blear\u00e8d visages come forth to view the issue of th' exploit go hercules live thou i live with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that mak'st the fray how all the other passions fleet to air as doubtful thoughts and rash embraced despair and shudd'ring fear and green eyed jealousy o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rain thy joy scant this excess i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit you see me lord bassanio where i stand such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich that only to stand high in your account i might in virtues beauties livings friends exceed account but the full sum of me is sum of something which to term in gross is an unlessoned girl unschooled unpracticed happy in this she is not yet so old but she may learn happier than this she is not bred so dull but she can learn happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord her governor her king myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted but now i was the lord of this fair mansion master of my servants queen o'er myself and even now but now this house these servants and this same myself are yours my lord's i give them with this ring which when you part from lose or give away let it presage the ruin of your love and be my vantage to exclaim on you is this true nerissa so do i my lord they are entirely welcome there are some shrewd contents in yond same paper that steals the color from bassanio's cheek some dear friend dead else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man what worse and worse  with leave bassanio i am half yourself and i must freely have the half of anything that this same paper brings you is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble what sum owes he the jew what no more pay him six thousand and deface the bond double six thousand and then treble that before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through bassanio's fault first go with me to church and call me wife and then away to venice to your friend for never shall you lie by portia's side with an unquiet soul you shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over when it is paid bring your true friend along my maid nerissa and myself meantime will live as maids and widows come away for you shall hence upon your wedding day bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer since you are dear bought i will love you dear but let me hear the letter of your friend o love dispatch all business and begone i never did repent for doing good nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this antonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord if it be so how little is the cost i have bestowed in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish cruelty this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it hear other things lorenzo i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lord's return for mine own part i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by nerissa here until her husband and my lord's return there is a monastery two miles off and there we will abide i do desire you not to deny this imposition the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you my people do already know my mind and will acknowledge you and jessica in place of lord bassanio and myself so fare you well till we shall meet again i thank you for your wish and am well pleased to wish it back on you fare you well jessica now balthazar as i have ever found thee honest true so let me find thee still take this same letter and use thou all th' endeavor of a man in speed to padua see thou render this into my cousin's hands doctor bellario and look what notes and garments he doth give thee bring them i pray thee with imagined speed unto the traject to the common ferry which trades to venice waste no time in words but get thee gone i shall be there before thee come on nerissa i have work in hand that you yet know not of we'll see our husbands before they think of us they shall nerissa but in such a habit that they shall think we are accomplish\u00e8d with that we lack i'll hold thee any wager when we are both accoutered like young men i'll prove the prettier fellow of the two and wear my dagger with the braver grace and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honorable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died  i could not do withal then i'll repent and wish for all that that i had not killed them and twenty of these puny lies i'll tell that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practice fie what a question's that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter but come i'll tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach which stays for us at the park gate and therefore haste away for we must measure twenty miles today i did my lord i am inform\u00e8d throughly of the cause which is the merchant here and which the jew is your name shylock of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law cannot impugn you as you do proceed you stand within his danger do you not do you confess the bond then must the jew be merciful the quality of mercy is not strained it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes 'tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the thron\u00e8d monarch better than his crown his scepter shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptered sway it is enthron\u00e8d in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest god's when mercy seasons justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there is he not able to discharge the money it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree establish\u00e8d 'twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it cannot be i pray you let me look upon the bond shylock there's thrice thy money offered thee why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchant's heart be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife  for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond therefore lay bare your bosom  it is so are there balance here to weigh the flesh have by some surgeon shylock on your charge to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death it is not so expressed but what of that 'twere good you do so much for charity you merchant have you anything to say your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer a pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine the court awards it and the law doth give it and you must cut this flesh from off his breast the law allows it and the court awards it tarry a little there is something else this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood the words expressly are a pound of flesh take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice confiscate unto the state of venice thyself shalt see the act for as thou urgest justice be assured thou shalt have justice more than thou desir'st soft the jew shall have all justice soft no haste he shall have nothing but the penalty therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh if thou tak'st more or less than a just pound be it but so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate why doth the jew pause take thy forfeiture he hath refused it in the open court he shall have merely justice and his bond thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture to be so taken at thy peril jew tarry jew the law hath yet another hold on you it is enacted in the laws of venice if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen the party 'gainst the which he doth contrive shall seize one half his goods the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state and the offender's life lies in the mercy of the duke only 'gainst all other voice in which predicament i say thou stand'st for it appears by manifest proceeding that indirectly and directly too thou hast contrived against the very life of the defendant and thou hast incurred the danger formerly by me rehearsed down therefore and beg mercy of the duke ay for the state not for antonio what mercy can you render him antonio art thou contented jew what dost thou say clerk draw a deed of gift i humbly do desire your grace of pardon i must away this night toward padua and it is meet i presently set forth he is well paid that is well satisfied and i delivering you

have nothing else but only this and now methinks i have a mind to it i see sir you are liberal in offers you taught me first to beg and now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answered that 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts and if your wife be not a madwoman and know how well i have deserved this ring she would not hold out enemy forever for giving it to me well peace be with you inquire the jew's house out give him this deed and let him sign it we'll away tonight and be a day before our husbands home this deed will be well welcome to lorenzo that cannot be his ring i do accept most thankfully and so i pray you tell him furthermore i pray you show my youth old shylock's house thou mayst i warrant we shall have old swearing that they did give the rings away to men but we'll outface them and outswear them too  away make haste thou know'st where i will tarry that light we see is burning in my hall how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world so doth the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king until a king be by and then his state empties itself as doth an inland brook into the main of waters music hark nothing is good i see without respect methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren how many things by season seasoned are to their right praise and true perfection peace how the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awaked he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo by the bad voice we have been praying for our husbands' welfare which speed we hope the better for our words are they

paler 'tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid let me give light but let me not be light for a light wife doth make a heavy husband and never be bassanio so for me but god sort all you are welcome home my lord you should in all sense be much bound to him for as i hear he was much bound for you sir you are very welcome to our house it must appear in other ways than words therefore i scant this breathing courtesy a quarrel ho already what's the matter you were to blame i must be plain with you to part so slightly with your wife's first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it and here he stands i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters now in faith gratiano you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief an 'twere to me i should be mad at it what ring gave you my lord not that i hope which you received of me even so void is your false heart of truth by heaven i will ne'er come in your bed until i see the ring if you had known the virtue of the ring or half her worthiness that gave the ring or your own honor to contain the ring you would not then have parted with the ring what man is there so much unreasonable if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony nerissa teaches me what to believe i'll die for 't but some woman had the ring let not that doctor e'er come near my house since he hath got the jewel that i loved and that which you did swear to keep for me i will become as liberal as you i'll not deny him anything i have no not my body nor my husband's bed know him i shall i am well sure of it lie not a night from home watch me like argus if you do not if i be left alone now by mine honor which is yet mine own i'll have that doctor for my bedfellow sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding mark you but that in both my eyes he doubly sees himself in each eye one swear by your double self and there's an oath of credit then you shall be his surety give him this and bid him keep it better than the other i had it of him pardon me bassanio for by this ring the doctor lay with me speak not so grossly you are all amazed here is a letter read it at your leisure it comes from padua from bellario there you shall find that portia was the doctor nerissa there her clerk lorenzo here shall witness i set forth as soon as you and even but now returned i have not yet entered my house antonio

let us go in and charge us there upon inter'gatories and we will answer all things faithfully", "MM_Isabella": "and have you nuns no farther privileges yes truly i speak not as desiring more but rather wishing a more strict restraint upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare who's that which calls peace and prosperity who is 't that calls why her unhappy brother let me ask the rather for i now must make you know i am that isabella and his sister woe me for what sir make me not your story you do blaspheme the good in mocking me someone with child by him my cousin juliet adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names by vain though apt affection o let him marry her doth he so seek his life alas what poor ability's in me to do him good my power alas i doubt  i'll see what i can do i will about it straight no longer staying but to give the mother notice of my affair i humbly thank you commend me to my brother soon at night i'll send him certain word of my success good sir adieu i am a woeful suitor to your honor please but your honor hear me there is a vice that most i do abhor and most desire should meet the blow of justice for which i would not plead but that i must for which i must not plead but that i am at war 'twixt will and will not i have a brother is condemned to die i do beseech you let it be his fault and not my brother o just but severe law i had a brother then heaven keep your honor must he needs die yes i do think that you might pardon him and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy but can you if you would but might you do 't and do the world no wrong if so your heart were touched with that remorse as mine is to him too late why no i that do speak a word may call it back again well believe this no ceremony that to great ones longs not the king's crown nor the deputed sword the marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does if he had been as you and you as he you would have slipped like him but he like you would not have been so stern i would to heaven i had your potency and you were isabel should it then be thus no i would tell what 'twere to be a judge and what a prisoner alas alas why all the souls that were were forfeit once and he that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy how would you be if he which is the top of judgment should but judge you as you are o think on that and mercy then will breathe within your lips like man new made tomorrow o that's sudden spare him spare him he's not prepared for death even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you who is it that hath died for this offense there's many have committed it yet show some pity so you must be the first that gives this sentence and he that suffers o it is excellent to have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would never be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder merciful heaven thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt splits the unwedgeable and gnarl\u00e8d oak than the soft myrtle but man proud man dressed in a little brief authority most ignorant of what he's most assured his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as makes the angels weep who with our spleens would all themselves laugh mortal we cannot weigh our brother with ourself great men may jest with saints 'tis wit in them but in the less foul profanation that in the captain's but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy because authority though it err like others hath yet a kind of medicine in itself that skins the vice o' th' top go to your bosom knock there and ask your heart what it doth know that's like my brother's fault if it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his let it not sound a thought upon your tongue against my brother's life gentle my lord turn back hark how i'll bribe you good my lord turn back ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you not with fond sicles of the tested gold or stones whose rate are either rich or poor as fancy values them but with true prayers that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere sunrise prayers from preserv\u00e8d souls from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal heaven keep your honor safe at what hour tomorrow shall i attend your lordship save your honor i am come to know your pleasure even so heaven keep your honor under your sentence when i beseech you that in his reprieve longer or shorter he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not 'tis set down so in heaven but not in earth sir believe this i had rather give my body than my soul how say you please you to do 't i'll take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all but charity that i do beg his life if it be sin heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit if that be sin i'll make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine and nothing of your answer let me be ignorant and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better so true as much for my poor brother as myself that is were i under the terms of death th' impression of keen whips i'd wear as rubies and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for ere i'd yield my body up to shame and 'twere the cheaper way better it were a brother died at once than that a sister by redeeming him should die forever ignomy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption o pardon me my lord it oft falls out to have what we would have we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love else let my brother die if not a fedary but only he owe and succeed thy weakness ay as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make forms women help heaven men their creation mar in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexions are and credulous to false prints i have no tongue but one gentle my lord let me entreat you speak the former language my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for 't i know your virtue hath a license in 't which seems a little fouler than it is to pluck on others ha little honor to be much believed and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming i will proclaim thee angelo look for 't sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretched throat i'll tell the world aloud what man thou art to whom should i complain did i tell this who would believe me o perilous mouths that bear in them one and the selfsame tongue either of condemnation or approof bidding the law make curtsy to their will hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite to follow as it draws i'll to my brother though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood yet hath he in him such a mind of honor that had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks he'd yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorred pollution then isabel live chaste and brother die more than our brother is our chastity i'll tell him yet of angelo's request and fit his mind to death for his soul's rest what ho peace here grace and good company my business is a word or two with claudio why as all comforts are most good most good indeed lord angelo having affairs to heaven intends you for his swift ambassador where you shall be an everlasting leiger therefore your best appointment make with speed tomorrow you set on none but such remedy as to save a head to cleave a heart in twain yes brother you may live there is a devilish mercy in the judge if you'll implore it that will free your life but fetter you till death ay just perpetual durance a restraint though all the world's vastidity you had to a determined scope in such a one as you consenting to 't would bark your honor from that trunk you bear and leave you naked o i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honor dar'st thou die the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies there spake my brother there my father's grave did utter forth a voice yes thou must die thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances this outward sainted deputy  whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i' th' head and follies doth enew as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil his filth within being cast he would appear a pond as deep as hell o 'tis the cunning livery of hell the damned'st body to invest and cover in prenzie guards dost thou think claudio if i would yield him my virginity thou mightst be freed yes he would give 't thee from this rank offense so to offend him still this night's the time that i should do what i abhor to name or else thou diest tomorrow o were it but my life i'd throw it down for your deliverance as frankly as a pin be ready claudio for your death tomorrow which is the least what says my brother and sham\u00e8d life a hateful alas alas o you beast o faithless coward o dishonest wretch wilt thou be made a man out of my vice is 't not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sister's shame what should i think heaven shield my mother played my father fair for such a warp\u00e8d slip of wilderness ne'er issued from his blood take my defiance die perish might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed i'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death no word to save thee o fie fie fie thy sin's not accidental but a trade mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd 'tis best that thou diest quickly what is your will i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile i am now going to resolve him i had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born but o how much is the good duke deceived in angelo if ever he return and i can speak to him i will open my lips in vain or discover his government let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name can this be so did angelo so leave her what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world what corruption in this life that it will let this man live but how out of this can she avail show me how good father the image of it gives me content already and i trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection i thank you for this comfort fare you well good father he hath a garden circummured with brick whose western side is with a vineyard backed and to that vineyard is a planch\u00e8d gate that makes his opening with this bigger key this other doth command a little door which from the vineyard to the garden leads there have i made my promise upon the heavy middle of the night to call upon him i have ta'en a due and wary note upon 't with whispering and most guilty diligence in action all of precept he did show me the way twice o'er no none but only a repair i' th' dark and that i have possessed him my most stay can be but brief for i have made him know i have a servant comes with me along that stays upon me whose persuasion is i come about my brother i do desire the like she'll take the enterprise upon her father if you advise it little have you to say when you depart from him but soft and low remember now my brother peace ho be here ho by your leave the better given me by so holy a man hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon nay but it is not so o i will to him and pluck out his eyes unhappy claudio wretched isabel injurious world most damn\u00e8d angelo i am directed by you to speak so indirectly i am loath i would say the truth but to accuse him so that is your part yet i am advised to do it he says to veil full purpose besides he tells me that if peradventure he speak against me on the adverse side i should not think it strange for 'tis a physic that's bitter to sweet end o peace the friar is come justice o royal duke vail your regard upon a wronged i would fain have said a maid o worthy prince dishonor not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and given me justice justice justice justice o worthy duke you bid me seek redemption of the devil hear me yourself for that which i must speak must either punish me not being believed or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here by course of justice most strange but yet most truly will i speak that angelo's forsworn is it not strange that angelo's a murderer is 't not strange that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite a virgin violator is it not strange and strange it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange nay it is ten times true for truth is truth to th' end of reck'ning o prince i conjure thee as thou believest there is another comfort than this world that thou neglect me not with that opinion that i am touched with madness make not impossible that which but seems unlike 'tis not impossible but one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute as angelo even so may angelo in all his dressings caracts titles forms be an archvillain believe it royal prince if he be less he's nothing but he's more had i more name for badness o gracious duke harp not on that nor do not banish reason for inequality but let your reason serve to make the truth appear where it seems hid and hide the false seems true i am the sister of one claudio condemned upon the act of fornication to lose his head condemned by angelo i in probation of a sisterhood was sent to by my brother one lucio as then the messenger  that's he indeed this gentleman told somewhat of my tale i went to this pernicious caitiff deputy  pardon it the phrase is to the matter in brief to set the needless process by how i persuaded how i prayed and kneeled how he refelled me and how i replied  for this was of much length the vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter he would not but by gift of my chaste body to his concupiscible intemperate lust release my brother and after much debatement my sisterly remorse confutes mine honor and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant for my poor brother's head o that it were as like as it is true and is this all then o you bless\u00e8d ministers above keep me in patience and with ripened time unfold the evil which is here wrapped up in countenance heaven shield your grace from woe as i thus wronged hence unbeliev\u00e8d go one that i would were here friar lodowick o give me pardon that i your vassal have employed and pained your unknown sovereignty i do my lord most bounteous sir look if it please you on this man condemned as if my brother lived i partly think a due sincerity governed his deeds till he did look on me since it is so let him not die my brother had but justice in that he did the thing for which he died for angelo his act did not o'ertake his bad intent and must be buried but as an intent that perished by the

suffocate follows the choking and this neglection of degree it is that by a pace goes backward with a purpose it hath to climb the general's disdained by him one step below he by the next that next by him beneath so every step exampled by the first pace that is sick of his superior grows to an envious fever of pale and bloodless emulation and 'tis this fever that keeps troy on foot not her own sinews to end a tale of length troy in our weakness stands not in her strength the great achilles whom opinion crowns the sinew and the forehand of our host having his ear full of his airy fame grows dainty of his worth and in his tent lies mocking our designs with him patroclus upon a lazy bed the live long day breaks scurril jests and with ridiculous and silly action which slanderer he imitation calls he pageants us sometime great agamemnon thy topless deputation he puts on and like a strutting player whose conceit lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich to hear the wooden dialogue and sound 'twixt his stretched footing and the scaffollage such to be pitied and o'erwrested seeming he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks 'tis like a chime a mending with terms unsquared which from the tongue of roaring typhon dropped would seem hyperboles at this fusty stuff the large achilles on his pressed bed lolling from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause cries excellent 'tis agamemnon right now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard as he being dressed to some oration that's done as near as the extremest ends of parallels as like as vulcan and his wife yet god achilles still cries excellent 'tis nestor right now play him me patroclus arming to answer in a night alarm and then forsooth the faint defects of age must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit and with a

fashion all our abilities gifts natures shapes severals and generals of grace exact achievements plots orders preventions excitements to the field or speech for truce success or loss what is or is not serves as stuff for these two to make paradoxes they tax our policy and call it cowardice count wisdom as no member of the war forestall prescience and esteem no act but that of hand the still and mental parts that do contrive how many hands shall strike when fitness calls them on and know by measure of their observant toil the enemy's weight  why this hath not a fingers dignity they call this bed work mapp'ry closet war so that the ram that batters down the wall for the great swinge and rudeness of his poise they place before his hand that made the engine or those that with the fineness of their souls by reason guide his execution amen nestor i have a young conception in my brain be you my time to bring it to some shape this 'tis blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride that hath to this maturity blown up in rank achilles must or now be cropped or shedding breed a nursery of like evil to overbulk us all this challenge that the gallant hector sends however it is spread in general name relates in purpose only to achilles and wake him to the answer think you give pardon to my speech therefore 'tis meet achilles meet not hector let us like merchants first show foul wares and think perchance they'll sell if not the luster of the better shall exceed by showing the worse first do not consent that ever hector and achilles meet for both our honor and our shame in this are dogged with two strange followers what glory our achilles shares from hector were he not proud we all should share with him but he already is too insolent and it were better parch in afric sun than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes should he scape hector fair if he were foiled why then we do our main opinion crush in taint of our best man no make a lott'ry and by device let blockish ajax draw the sort to fight with hector among ourselves give him allowance for the better man for that will physic the great myrmidon who broils in loud applause and make him fall his crest that prouder than blue iris bends if the dull brainless ajax come safe off we'll dress him up in voices if he fail yet go we under our opinion still that we have better men but hit or miss our project's life this shape of sense assumes ajax employed plucks down achilles' plumes we saw him at the opening of his tent he is not sick achilles hath inveigled his fool from him he no you see he is his argument that has his argument achilles the amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie here comes patroclus the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure achilles will not to the field tomorrow he doth rely on none but carries on the stream of his dispose without observance or respect of any in will peculiar and in self admission things small as nothing for request's sake only he makes important possessed he is with greatness and speaks not to himself but with a pride that quarrels at self breath imagined worth holds in his blood such swoll'n and hot discourse that 'twixt his mental and his active parts kingdomed achilles in commotion rages and batters down himself what should i say he is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it cry no recovery o agamemnon let it not be so we'll consecrate the steps that ajax makes when they go from achilles shall the proud lord that bastes his arrogance with his own seam and never suffers matter of the world enter his thoughts save such as doth revolve and ruminate himself shall he be worshipped of that we hold an idol more than he no this thrice worthy and right valiant lord shall not so stale his palm nobly acquired nor by my will assubjugate his merit as amply titled as achilles is by going to achilles that were to enlard his fat already pride and add more coals to cancer when he burns with entertaining great hyperion this lord go to him jupiter forbid and say in thunder achilles go to him not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel the raven chides blackness wit would be out of fashion he would have ten shares my lord you feed too much on this dislike why 'tis this naming of him does him harm here is a man but 'tis before his face i will be silent know the whole world he is as valiant  if he were proud  ay or surly borne  thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure praise him that gat thee she that gave thee suck famed be thy tutor and thy parts of nature thrice famed beyond beyond thy erudition but he that disciplined thine arms to fight let mars divide eternity in twain and give him half and for thy vigor bull bearing milo his addition yield to sinewy ajax i will not praise thy wisdom which like a bourn a pale a shore confines thy spacious and dilated parts here's nestor instructed by the antiquary times he must he is he cannot but be wise  but pardon father nestor were your days as green as ajax' and your brain so tempered you should not have the eminence of him but be as ajax there is no tarrying here the hart achilles keeps thicket please it our great general to call together all his state of war fresh kings are come to troy tomorrow we must with all our main of power stand fast and here's a lord come knights from east to west and cull their flower ajax shall cope the best achilles stands i' th' entrance of his tent please it our general pass strangely by him as if he were forgot and princes all lay negligent and loose regard upon him i will come last 'tis like he'll question me why such unplausive eyes are bent why turned on him if so i have derision medicinable to use between your strangeness and his pride which his own will shall have desire to drink it may do good pride hath no other glass to show itself but pride for supple knees feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees now great thetis' son  a strange fellow here writes me that man how dearly ever parted how much in having or without or in cannot make boast to have that which he hath nor feels not what he owes but by reflection as when his virtues shining upon others heat them and they retort that heat again to the first giver i do not strain at the position  it is familiar but at the author's drift who in his circumstance expressly proves that no man is the lord of anything  though in and of him there be much consisting  till he communicate his parts to others nor doth he of himself know them for aught till he behold them formed in the applause where they're extended who like an arch reverb'rate the voice again or like a gate of steel fronting the sun receives and renders back his figure and his heat i was much rapt in this and apprehended here immediately th' unknown ajax heavens what a man is there a very horse that has he knows not what nature what things there are most abject in regard and dear in use what things again most dear in the esteem and poor in worth now shall we see tomorrow  an act that very chance doth throw upon him  ajax renowned o heavens what some men do while some men leave to do how some men creep in skittish fortune's hall whiles others play the idiots in her eyes how one man eats into another's pride while pride is fasting in his wantonness to see these grecian lords why even already they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder as if his foot were on brave hector's breast and great troy shrieking time hath my lord a wallet at his back wherein he puts alms for oblivion a great sized monster of ingratitudes those scraps are good deeds past which are devoured as fast as they are made forgot as soon as done perseverance dear my lord keeps honor bright to have done is to hang quite out of fashion like a rusty mail in monumental mock'ry take the instant way for honor travels in a strait so narrow where one but goes abreast keep then the path for emulation hath a thousand sons that one by one pursue if you give way or turn aside from the direct forthright like to an entered tide they all rush by and leave you hindmost or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank lie there for pavement to the abject rear o'errun and trampled on then what they do in present though less than yours in past must o'ertop yours for time is like a fashionable host that slightly shakes his parting guest by th' hand and with his arms outstretched as he would fly grasps in the comer welcome ever smiles and farewell goes out sighing let not virtue seek remuneration for the thing it was for beauty wit high birth vigor of bone desert in service love friendship charity are subjects all to envious and calumniating time one touch of nature makes the whole world kin that all with one consent praise newborn gauds though they are made and molded of things past and give to dust that is a little gilt more laud than gilt o'erdusted the present eye praises the present object then marvel not thou great and complete man that all the greeks begin to worship ajax since things in motion sooner catch the eye than what stirs not the cry went once on thee and still it might and yet it may again if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive and case thy reputation in thy tent whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves and drave great mars to faction but 'gainst your privacy the reasons are more potent and heroical 'tis known achilles that you are in love with one of priam's daughters is that a wonder the providence that's in a watchful state knows almost every grain of pluto's gold finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deep keeps place with thought and almost like the gods do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles there is a mystery with whom relation durst never meddle in the soul of state which hath an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to all the commerce that you have had with troy as perfectly is ours as yours my lord and better would it fit achilles much to throw down hector than polyxena but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home when fame shall in our islands sound her trump and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing great hector's sister did achilles win but our great ajax bravely beat down him farewell my lord i as your lover speak the fool slides o'er the ice that you should break no trumpet answers 'tis he i ken the manner of his gait he rises on the toe that spirit of his in aspiration lifts him from the earth yet is the kindness but particular 'twere better she were kissed in general o deadly gall and theme of all our scorns for which we lose our heads to gild his horns it were no match your nail against his horn may i sweet lady beg a kiss of you i do desire it why then for venus' sake give me a kiss when helen is a maid again and his never's my day and then a kiss of you fie fie upon her there's language in her eye her cheek her lip nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out at every joint and motive of her body o these encounterers so glib of tongue that give accosting welcome ere it comes and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts to every tickling reader set them down for sluttish spoils of opportunity and daughters of the game the trojan's trumpet they are opposed already the youngest son of priam a true knight not yet mature yet matchless firm of word speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calmed his heart and hand both open and both free for what he has he gives what thinks he shows yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty nor dignifies an impair thought with breath manly as hector but more dangerous for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes to tender objects but he in heat of action is more vindicative than jealous love they call him troilus and on him erect a second hope as fairly built as hector thus says aeneas one that knows the youth even to his inches and with private soul did in great ilium thus translate him to me i wonder now how yonder city stands when we have here her base and pillar by us sir i foretold you then what would ensue my prophecy is but half his journey yet for yonder walls that pertly front your town yon towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds must kiss their own feet so to him we leave it most gentle and most valiant hector welcome after the general i beseech you next to feast with me and see me at my tent at menelaus' tent most princely troilus there diomed doth feast with him tonight who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth but gives all gaze and bent of amorous view on the fair cressid you shall command me sir as gentle tell me of what honor was this cressida in troy had she no lover there that wails her absence here comes himself to guide you follow his torch he goes to calchas' tent i'll keep you company stand where the torch may not discover us she will sing any man at first sight list how now trojan you are moved prince let us depart i pray you lest your displeasure should enlarge itself to wrathful terms this place is dangerous the time right deadly i beseech you go nay good my lord go off you flow to great distraction come my lord you have not patience come how now my lord you shake my lord at something will you go you will break out come come you have sworn patience my lord  all's done my lord why stay we then i cannot conjure trojan most sure she was nor mine my lord cressid was here but now what hath she done prince that can soil our mothers may worthy troilus be half attached with that which here his passion doth express o contain yourself your passion draws ears hither i'll bring you to the gates o courage courage princes great achilles is arming weeping cursing vowing vengeance patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood together with his mangled myrmidons that noseless handless hacked and chipped come to him crying on hector ajax hath lost a friend and foams at mouth and he is armed and at it roaring for troilus who hath done today mad and fantastic execution engaging and redeeming of himself with such a careless force and forceless care as if that

lie death i hear him as he flattered antony thou wouldst say speak to me home mince not the general tongue name cleopatra as she is called in rome rail thou in fulvia's phrase and taunt my faults with

our officers have notice what we purpose i shall break the cause of our expedience to the queen and get her leave to part for not alone the death of fulvia with more urgent touches do strongly speak to us but the letters too of many our contriving friends in rome petition us at home sextus pompeius hath given the dare to caesar and commands the empire of the sea our slippery people whose love is never linked to the deserver till his deserts are past begin to throw pompey the great and all his dignities upon his son who high in name and power higher than both in blood and life stands up for the main soldier whose quality going on the sides o' th' world may danger much is breeding which like the courser's hair hath yet but life and not a serpent's poison say our pleasure to such whose place is under us requires our quick remove from hence i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose  now my dearest queen  what's the matter the gods best know  cleopatra  most sweet queen  how now lady hear me queen the strong necessity of time commands our services awhile but my full heart remains in use with you our italy shines o'er with civil swords sextus pompeius makes his approaches to the port of rome equality of two domestic powers breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength are newly grown to love the condemned pompey rich in his father's honor creeps apace into the hearts of such as have not thrived upon the present state whose numbers threaten and quietness grown sick of rest would purge by any desperate change my more particular and that which most with you should safe my going is fulvia's death she's dead my queen look here and at thy sovereign leisure read the garboils she awaked at the last best see when and where she died quarrel no more but be prepared to know the purposes i bear which are or cease as you shall give th' advice by the fire that quickens nilus' slime i go from hence thy soldier servant making peace or war as thou affects my precious queen forbear and give true evidence to his love which stands an honorable trial you'll heat my blood no more now by my sword  i'll leave you lady but that your royalty holds idleness your subject i should take you for idleness itself let us go come our separation so abides and flies that thou residing here goes yet with me and i hence fleeting here remain with thee away if we compose well here to parthia hark ventidius 'tis spoken well were we before our armies and to fight i should do thus thank you sit sir i learn you take things ill which are not so or being concern you not my being in egypt caesar what was 't to you how intend you practiced you do mistake your business my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause of this my letters before did satisfy you if you'll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have to make it with it must not be with this not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain on 't  very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another the third o' th' world is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife so much uncurbable her garboils caesar made out of her impatience which not wanted shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant did you too much disquiet for that you must but say i could not help it sir he fell upon me ere admitted then three kings i had newly feasted and did want of what i was i' th' morning but next day i told him of myself which was as much as to have asked him pardon let this fellow be nothing of our strife if we contend out of our question wipe him no lepidus let him speak the honor is sacred which he talks on now supposing that i lacked it but on caesar the article of my oath neglected rather and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge as nearly as i may i'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness nor my power work without it truth is that fulvia to have me out of egypt made wars here for which myself the ignorant motive do so far ask pardon as befits mine honor to stoop in such a case thou art a soldier only speak no more you wrong this presence therefore speak no more i am not married caesar let me hear agrippa further speak will caesar speak what power is in agrippa if i would say agrippa be it so to make this good may i never to this good purpose that so fairly shows dream of impediment let me have thy hand further this act of grace and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs i did not think to draw my sword 'gainst pompey for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me i must thank him only lest my remembrance suffer ill report at heel of that defy him where lies he what is his strength by land so is the fame would we had spoke together haste we for it yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we the business we have talked of let us lepidus not lack your company the world and my great office will sometimes divide me from your bosom goodnight sir my octavia read not my blemishes in the world's report i have not kept my square but that to come shall all be done by th' rule good night dear lady  good night sir now sirrah you do wish yourself in egypt if you can your reason say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher caesar's or mine speak this no more get thee gone say to ventidius i would speak with him he shall to parthia be it art or hap he hath spoken true the very dice obey him and in our sports my better cunning faints under his chance if we draw lots he speeds his cocks do win the battle still of mine when it is all to naught and his quails ever beat mine inhooped at odds i will to egypt and though i make this marriage for my peace i' th' east my pleasure lies o come ventidius you must to parthia your commission's ready follow me and receive 't thou canst not fear us pompey with thy sails we'll speak with thee at sea at land thou know'st how much we do o'ercount thee which do not be entreated to but weigh what it is worth embraced that's our offer i have heard it pompey and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you the beds i' th' east are soft and thanks to you that called me timelier than my purpose hither for i have gained by 't that will i pompey you have heard much and fair words to them show 's the way sir thus do they sir they take the flow o' th' nile by certain scales i' th' pyramid they know by th' height the lowness or the mean if dearth or foison follow the higher nilus swells the more it promises as it ebbs the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain and shortly comes to harvest ay lepidus they are so it is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is and moves with it own organs it lives by that which nourisheth it and the elements once out of it it transmigrates of it own color too 'tis so and the tears of it are wet with the health that pompey gives him else he is a very epicure these quicksands lepidus keep off them for you sink bear him ashore i'll pledge it for him pompey it ripens towards it strike the vessels ho here's to caesar be a child o' th' time come let's all take hands till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense in soft and delicate lethe cup us till the world go round cup us till the world go round and shall sir give 's your hand no further sir make me not offended in your distrust you shall not find though you be therein curious the least cause for what you seem to fear so the gods keep you and make the hearts of romans serve your ends we will here part the april's in her eyes it is love's spring and these the showers to bring it on be cheerful her tongue will not obey her heart nor can her heart inform her tongue the swan's down feather that stands upon the swell at the full of tide and neither way inclines come sir come i'll wrestle with you in my strength of love look here i have you thus i let you go and give you to the gods farewell nay nay octavia not only that  that were excusable that and thousands more of semblable import but he hath waged new wars 'gainst pompey made his will and read it to public ear spoke scantly of me when perforce he could not but pay me terms of honor cold and sickly he vented them most narrow measure lent me when the best hint was given him he not took 't or did it from his teeth gentle octavia let your best love draw to that point which seeks best to preserve it if i lose mine honor i lose myself better i were not yours than yours so branchless but as you requested yourself shall go between 's the meantime lady i'll raise the preparation of a war shall stain your brother make your soonest haste so your desires are yours when it appears to you where this begins turn your displeasure that way for our faults can never be so equal that your love can equally move with them provide your going choose your own company and command what cost your heart has mind to is it not strange canidius that from tarentum and brundusium he could so quickly cut the ionian sea and take in toryne you have heard on 't sweet a good rebuke which might have well becomed the best of men to taunt at slackness canidius we will fight with him by sea for that he dares us to 't by sea by sea i'll fight at sea our overplus of shipping will we burn and with the rest full manned from th' head of actium beat th' approaching caesar but if we fail we then can do 't at land thy business can he be there in person 'tis impossible strange that his power should be canidius our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land and our twelve thousand horse we'll to our ship  away my thetis how now worthy soldier well well away set we our squadrons on yond side o' th' hill in eye of caesar's battle from which place we may the number of the ships behold and so proceed accordingly hark the land bids me tread no more upon 't it is ashamed to bear me friends come hither i am so lated in the world that i have lost my way forever i have a ship laden with gold take that divide it fly and make your peace with caesar i have fled myself and have instructed cowards to run and show their shoulders friends begone i have myself resolved upon a course which has no need of you begone my treasure's in the harbor take it o i followed that i blush to look upon my very hairs do mutiny for the white reprove the brown for rashness and they them for fear and doting friends begone you shall have letters from me to some friends that will sweep your way for you pray you look not sad nor make replies of loathness take the hint which my despair proclaims let that be left which leaves itself to the seaside straightway i will possess you of that ship and treasure leave me i pray a little pray you now nay do so for indeed i have lost command therefore i pray you i'll see you by and by no no no no no oh fie fie fie yes my lord yes he at philippi kept his sword e'en like a dancer while i struck the lean and wrinkled cassius and 'twas i that the mad brutus ended he alone dealt on lieutenantry and no practice had in the brave squares of war yet now no matter i have offended reputation a most unnoble swerving o whither hast them led me egypt see how i convey my shame out of thine eyes by looking back what i have left behind 'stroyed in dishonor egypt thou knew'st too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings and thou shouldst tow me after o'er my spirit thy full supremacy thou knew'st and that thy beck might from the bidding of the gods command me now i must to the young man send humble treaties dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness who with half the bulk o' th' world played as i pleased making and marring fortunes you did know how much you were my conqueror and that my sword made weak by my affection would obey it on all cause fall not a tear i say one of them rates all that is won and lost give me a kiss even this repays me  we sent our schoolmaster is he come back  love i am full of lead some wine within there and our viands fortune knows we scorn her most when most she offers blows is that his answer the queen shall then have courtesy so she will yield us up let her know 't  to the boy caesar send this grizzled head and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities to him again tell him he wears the rose of youth upon him from which the world should note something particular his coin ships legions may be a coward's whose ministers would prevail under the service of a child as soon as i' th' command of caesar i dare him therefore to lay his gay caparisons apart and answer me declined sword against sword ourselves alone i'll write it follow me favors by jove that thunders what art thou fellow approach there ah you kite now gods and devils authority melts from me of late when i cried ho like boys unto a muss kings would start forth and cry your will have you no ears i am antony yet take hence this jack and whip him moon and stars whip him were 't twenty of the greatest tributaries that do acknowledge caesar should i find them so saucy with the hand of she here what's her name since she was cleopatra whip him fellows till like a boy you see him cringe his face and whine aloud for mercy take him hence tug him away being whipped bring him again this jack of caesar's shall bear us an errand to him you were half blasted ere i knew you ha have i my pillow left unpressed in rome forborne the getting of a lawful race and by a gem of women to be abused by one that looks on feeders you have been a boggler ever but when we in our viciousness grow hard  o misery on 't the wise gods seel our eyes in our own filth drop our clear judgments make us adore our errors laugh at 's while we strut to our confusion i found you as a morsel cold upon dead caesar's trencher nay you were a fragment of gneius pompey's besides what hotter hours unregistered in vulgar fame you have luxuriously picked out for i am sure though you can guess what temperance should be you know not what it is to let a fellow that will take rewards and say god quit you be familiar with my playfellow your hand this kingly seal and plighter of high hearts o that i were upon the hill of basan to outroar the horn\u00e8d herd for i have savage cause and to proclaim it civilly were like a haltered neck which does the hangman thank for being yare about him is he whipped cried he and begged he pardon if that thy father live let him repent thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry to follow caesar in his triumph since thou hast been whipped for following him henceforth the white hand of a lady fever thee shake thou to look on 't get thee back to caesar tell him thy entertainment look thou say he makes me angry with him for he seems proud and disdainful harping on what i am not what he knew i was he makes me angry and at this time most easy 'tis to do 't when my good stars that were my former guides have empty left their orbs and shot their fires into th' abysm of hell if he mislike my speech and what is done tell him he has hipparchus my enfranch\u00e8d bondman whom he may at pleasure whip or hang or torture as he shall like to quit me urge it thou hence with thy stripes begone alack our terrene moon is now eclipsed and it portends alone the fall of antony to flatter caesar would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points coldhearted toward me i am satisfied caesar sits down in alexandria where i will oppose his fate our force by land hath nobly held our severed navy too have knit again and fleet threatening most sealike where hast thou been my heart dost thou hear lady if from the field i shall return once more to kiss these lips i will appear in blood i and my sword will earn our chronicle there's hope in 't yet i will be treble sinewed hearted breathed and fight maliciously for when mine hours were nice and lucky men did ransom lives of me for jests but now i'll set my teeth and send to darkness all that stop me come let's have one other gaudy night call to me all my sad captains fill our bowls once more let's mock the midnight bell we will yet do well do so we'll speak to them and tonight i'll force the wine peep through their scars come on my queen there's sap in 't yet the next time i do fight i'll make death love me for i will contend even with his pestilent scythe he will not fight with me domitius why should he not tomorrow soldier by sea

seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle swell with the touches of those flower soft hands that yarely frame the office from the barge a strange invisible perfume hits the sense of the adjacent wharfs

yet he loves antony hoo hearts tongues figures scribes bards poets cannot think speak cast write sing number hoo  his love to antony but as for caesar kneel down kneel down and wonder they are his

antony though my reason sits in the wind against me think and die antony only that would make his will lord of his reason what though you fled from that great face of war whose several ranges frighted each other why should he follow the itch of his affection should not then have nicked his captainship at such a point when half to half the world opposed he being the mer\u00e8d question 'twas a shame no less than was his loss to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing yes like enough high battled caesar will unstate his happiness and be staged to th' show against a sworder i see men's

emptiness caesar thou hast subdued his judgment too mine honesty and i begin to square the loyalty well held to fools does make our faith mere folly yet he that can endure to follow with allegiance a fall'n lord does conquer him that did his master conquer and earns a place i' th' story he needs as many sir as caesar has or needs not us if caesar please our master will leap to be his friend for us you know whose he is we are and that is caesar's to be sure of that i will ask antony sir sir thou art so leaky that we must leave thee to thy sinking for thy dearest quit thee you will be whipped

must with his judgment look either to die the death or to abjure forever the society of men therefore fair hermia question your desires know of your youth examine well your blood whether if you yield not to your father's choice you can endure the livery of a nun for aye to be in shady cloister mewed to live a barren sister all your life chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon thrice bless\u00e8d they that master so their blood to undergo such maiden pilgrimage but earthlier happy is the rose distilled than that which withering on the virgin thorn grows lives and dies in single blessedness take time to pause and by the next new moon the sealing day betwixt my love and me for everlasting bond of fellowship upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your father's will or else to wed demetrius as he would or on diana's altar to protest for aye austerity and single life i must confess that i have heard so much and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof but

broke off not paying me a welcome trust me sweet out of this silence yet i picked a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious

notably discharged but come your bergomask let your epilogue alone the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve lovers to bed 'tis almost fairy time i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn as much as

the wars of york and lancaster that had befall'n us as we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him

skulls and in the holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept  as 'twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems that wooed the slimy bottom of the deep and mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by

nine till twelve is three long hours yet she is not come had she affections and warm youthful blood she would be as swift in motion as a ball my words would bandy her to my sweet love and his to me

too much conceit more rich in matter than in words brags of his substance not of ornament they are but beggars that can count their worth but my true love is grown to such excess i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth gallop apace you fiery footed steeds towards phoebus' lodging such a wagoner as pha\u00ebton would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately spread thy close curtain love performing night that runaways' eyes may wink and romeo leap to these arms untalked of and unseen lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties or if love be blind it best agrees

raven's back come gentle night come loving black browed night give me my romeo and when i shall die take him and cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun o i have bought the mansion of a love but not possessed it and though i am sold not yet enjoyed so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them o here comes my nurse and she brings news and every tongue that speaks but romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence  now nurse what news what hast thou there the cords that romeo bid thee fetch ay me what news why dost thou wring thy hands can heaven be so envious what devil art thou that dost torment me

mistaking offer up to joy my husband lives that tybalt would have slain and tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband all this is comfort wherefore weep i then some word there was worser than tybalt's death that murdered me i would forget it fain but o it presses to my memory like damn\u00e8d guilty deeds to sinners' minds tybalt is dead and romeo banish\u00e8d that banish\u00e8d that one word banish\u00e8d hath slain ten thousand tybalts tybalt's death was woe enough if it had ended there or if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be ranked with other griefs why followed not when she said tybalt's dead thy father or thy mother nay or both which modern lamentation might have moved but with a rearward following tybalt's death romeo is banish\u00e8d to speak that word is father mother tybalt romeo juliet all slain all dead romeo is banish\u00e8d there is no end no limit measure bound in that word's death no words can that woe sound where is my father and my mother

see thee now thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale o fortune fortune all men call thee fickle if thou art fickle what dost thou with him that is renowned for faith be fickle fortune for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long but send him back who is 't that calls it is my lady mother is she not down so late or up so early what unaccustomed cause procures her hither madam i am not well yet let me weep for such a feeling loss feeling so the loss i cannot choose but ever weep the friend what villain madam villain and he be many miles asunder  god pardon him i do with all my heart and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart ay madam from the reach of these my hands would none but i might venge my cousin's death indeed i never shall be satisfied with romeo till i behold him dead  is my poor heart so for a kinsman vexed madam if you could find out but a man to bear a poison i would temper it that romeo should upon receipt thereof soon sleep in quiet o how my heart abhors to hear him named and cannot come to him to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that hath slaughtered him and joy comes well in such a needy time what are they beseech your ladyship madam in happy time what day is that now by saint peter's church and peter too he shall not make me there a joyful bride i wonder at this haste that i must wed ere he that should be husband comes to woo i pray you tell my lord and father madam i will not marry yet and when i do i swear it shall be romeo whom you know i hate rather than paris these are news indeed not proud you have but thankful that you have proud can i never be of what i hate but thankful even for hate that is meant love good father i beseech you on my knees hear me with patience but to speak a word is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief  o sweet my mother cast me not away delay this marriage for a month a week or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies o god o nurse how shall this be prevented my husband is on earth my faith in heaven how shall that faith return again to earth unless that husband send it me from heaven by leaving earth comfort me counsel me  alack alack that heaven should practice stratagems upon so soft a subject as myself  what sayst thou hast thou not a word of joy some comfort nurse speak'st thou from thy heart amen well thou hast comforted me marvelous much go in and tell my lady i am gone having displeased my father to lawrence' cell to make confession and to be absolved ancient damnation o most wicked fiend is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue which she hath praised him with above compare so many thousand times go counselor thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain i'll to the friar to know his remedy if all else fail myself have power to die that may be sir when i may be a wife what must be shall be to answer that i should confess to you i will confess to you that i love him if i do so it will be of more price being spoke behind your back than to your face the tears have got small victory by that for it was bad enough before their spite that is no slander sir which is a truth and what i spake i spake it to my face it may be so for it is not mine own  are you at leisure holy father now or shall i come to you at evening mass o shut the door and when thou hast done so come weep with me past hope past care past help tell me not friar that thou hearest of this unless thou tell me how i may prevent it if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise and with this knife i'll help it presently god joined my heart and romeo's thou our hands and ere this hand by thee to romeo's sealed shall be the label to another deed or my true heart with treacherous revolt turn to another this shall slay them both therefore out of thy long experienced time give me some present counsel or behold 'twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the umpire arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honor bring be not so long to speak i long to die if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy o bid me leap rather than marry paris from off the battlements of any tower or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk where serpents are chain me with roaring bears or hide me nightly in a charnel house o'ercovered quite with dead men's rattling bones with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls or bid me go into a new made grave and hide me with a dead man in his shroud things that to hear them told have made me tremble and i will do it without fear or doubt to live an unstained wife to my sweet love give me give me o tell not me of fear love give me strength and strength shall help afford farewell dear father where i have learned me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you and your behests and am enjoined by holy lawrence to fall prostrate here to beg your pardon pardon i beseech you henceforward i am ever ruled by you i met the youthful lord at lawrence' cell and gave him what becom\u00e8d love i might not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty nurse will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ay those attires are best but gentle nurse i pray thee leave me to myself tonight for i have need of many orisons to move the heavens to smile upon my state which well thou knowest is cross and full of sin no madam we have culled such necessaries as are behooveful for our state tomorrow so please you let me now be left alone and let the nurse this night sit up with you for i am sure you have your hands full all in this so sudden business farewell god knows when we shall meet again i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins that almost freezes up the heat of life i'll call them back again to comfort me  nurse what should she do here my dismal scene i needs must act alone come vial what if this mixture do not work at all shall i be married then tomorrow morning no no this shall forbid it lie thou there what if it be a poison which the friar subtly hath ministered to have me dead lest in this marriage he should be dishonored because he married me before to romeo i fear it is and yet methinks it should not for he hath still been tried a holy man how if when i am laid into the tomb i wake before the time that romeo come to redeem me there's a fearful point shall i not then be stifled in the vault to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in and there die strangled ere my romeo comes or if i live is it not very like the horrible conceit of death and night together with the terror of the place  as in a vault an ancient receptacle where for this many hundred years the bones of all my buried ancestors are packed where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth lies fest'ring in his shroud where as they say at some hours in the night spirits resort  alack alack is it not like that i so early waking what with loathsome smells and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth that living mortals hearing them run mad  o if i wake shall i not be distraught environ\u00e8d with all these hideous fears and madly play with my forefathers' joints and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud and in this rage with some great kinsman's bone as with a club dash out my desp'rate brains o look methinks i see my cousin's ghost seeking out romeo that did spit his body upon a rapier's point stay tybalt stay romeo romeo romeo here's drink i drink to thee o comfortable friar where is my lord i do remember well where i should be and there i am where is my romeo go get thee hence for i will not away what's here a cup closed in my true love's hand poison i see hath been his timeless end  o churl drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after i will kiss thy lips haply some poison yet doth hang on them to make me die with a restorative thy lips are warm yea noise then i'll be brief o happy dagger this is thy sheath there rust and let me die", "LLL_Holofernes": "the deer was as you know

beseech your majesty give me leave to go sorrow would solace and mine age would ease my staff here noble henry is my staff as willingly do i the same resign as e'er thy father henry made it mine and even as willingly at thy feet i leave it as others would ambitiously receive it farewell good king when i am dead and gone may honorable peace attend thy throne thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud and after summer evermore succeeds barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold so cares and joys abound as seasons fleet sirs what's o'clock ten is the hour that was appointed me to watch the coming of my punished duchess uneath may she endure the flinty streets to tread them with her tender feeling feet sweet nell ill can thy noble mind abrook the abject people gazing on thy face with envious looks laughing at thy shame that erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels when thou didst ride in triumph through the streets but soft i think she comes and i'll prepare my tearstained eyes to see her miseries no stir not for your lives let her pass by be patient gentle nell forget this grief ah nell forbear thou aimest all awry i must offend before i be attainted and had i twenty times so many foes and each of them had twenty times their power all these could not procure me any scathe so long as i am loyal true and crimeless wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach why yet thy scandal were not wiped away but i in danger for the breach of law thy greatest help is quiet gentle nell i pray thee sort thy heart to patience these few days' wonder will be quickly worn and my consent ne'er asked herein before this is close dealing well i will be there my nell i take my leave and master sheriff let not her penance exceed the king's commission must you sir john protect my lady here entreat her not the worse in that i pray you use her well the world may laugh again and i may live to do you kindness if you do it her and so sir john farewell witness my tears i cannot stay to speak all happiness unto my lord the king pardon my liege that i have stayed so long well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush nor change my countenance for this arrest a heart unspotted is not easily daunted the purest spring is not so free from mud as i am clear from treason to my sovereign who can accuse me wherein am i guilty is it but thought so what are they that think it i never robbed the soldiers of their pay nor ever had one penny bribe from france so help me god as i have watched the night  ay night by night in studying good for england that doit that e'er i wrested from the king or any groat i hoarded to my use be brought against me at my trial day no many a pound of mine own proper store because i would not tax the needy commons have i dispurs\u00e8d to the garrisons and never asked for restitution i say no more than truth so help me god why 'tis well known that whiles i was protector pity was all the fault that was in me for i should melt at an offender's tears and lowly words were ransom for their fault unless it were a bloody murderer or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers i never gave them condign punishment murder indeed that bloody sin i tortured above the felon or what trespass else ah gracious lord these days are dangerous virtue is choked with foul ambition and charity chased hence by rancor's hand foul subornation is predominant and equity exiled your highness' land i know their complot is to have my life and if my death might make this island happy and prove the period of their tyranny i would expend it with all willingness but mine is made the prologue to their play for thousands more that yet suspect no peril will not conclude their plotted tragedy beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice and suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate sharp buckingham unburdens with his tongue the envious load that lies upon his heart and dogged york that reaches at the moon whose overweening arm i have plucked back by false accuse doth level at my life  and you my sovereign lady with the rest causeless have laid disgraces on my head and with your best endeavor have stirred up my liefest liege to be mine enemy ay all of you have laid your heads together  myself had notice of your conventicles  and all to make away my guiltless life i shall not want false witness to condemn me nor store of treasons to augment my guilt the ancient proverb will be well effected a staff is quickly found to beat a dog far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed beshrew the winners for they played me false and well such losers may have leave to speak ah thus king henry throws away his crutch before his legs be firm to bear his body  thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first ah that my fear were false ah that it were for good king henry thy decay i fear", "JC_Antony": "caesar my lord i shall remember when caesar says do this it is performed caesar fear him not caesar he's not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given so to most noble caesar o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure fare thee well  i know not gentlemen what you intend who else must be let blood who else is rank if i myself there is no hour so fit as caesar's death's hour nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords made rich with the most noble blood of all this world i do beseech you if you bear me hard now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke fulfill your pleasure live a thousand years i shall not find myself so apt to die no place will please me so no mean of death as here by caesar and by you cut off the choice and master spirits of this age i doubt not of your wisdom let each man render me his bloody hand first marcus brutus will i shake with you  next caius cassius do i take your hand  now decius brutus yours now yours metellus  yours cinna and my valiant casca yours  though last not least in love yours good trebonius  gentlemen all alas what shall i say my credit now stands on such slippery ground that one of two bad ways you must conceit me either a coward or a flatterer  that i did love thee caesar o 'tis true if then thy spirit look upon us now shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death to see thy antony making his peace shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes  most noble in the presence of thy corpse had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies pardon me julius here wast thou bayed brave hart here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy lethe o world thou wast the forest to this hart and this indeed o world the heart of thee how like a deer strucken by many princes dost thou here lie pardon me caius cassius the enemies of caesar shall say this then in a friend it is cold modesty therefore i took your hands but was indeed swayed from the point by looking down on caesar friends am i with you all and love you all upon this hope that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous that's all i seek and am moreover suitor that i may produce his body to the marketplace and in the pulpit as becomes a friend speak in the order of his funeral be it so i do desire no more o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth that i am meek and gentle with these butchers thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever liv\u00e8d in the tide of times woe to the hand that shed this costly blood over thy wounds now do i prophesy which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue a curse shall light upon the limbs of men domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quartered with the hands of war all pity choked with custom of fell deeds and caesar's spirit ranging for revenge with ate by his side come hot from hell shall in these confines with a monarch's voice cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men groaning for burial you serve octavius caesar do you not caesar did write for him to come to rome thy heart is big get thee apart and weep passion i see is catching for mine eyes seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine began to water is thy master coming post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome no rome of safety for octavius yet hie hence and tell him so yet stay awhile thou shalt not back till i have borne this corpse into the marketplace there shall i try in my oration how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men according to the which thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things lend me your hand for brutus' sake i am beholding to you you gentle romans  friends romans countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury caesar not to praise him the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interr\u00e8d with their bones so let it be with caesar the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answered it here under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honorable man so are they all all honorable men come i to speak in caesar's funeral he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honorable man he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honorable man you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse was this ambition yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honorable man i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do know you all did love him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourn for him  o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason bear with me my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pause till it come back to me but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world now lies he there and none so poor to do him reverence o masters if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honorable men i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you than i will wrong such honorable men but here's a parchment with the seal of caesar i found it in his closet 'tis his will let but the commons hear this testament which pardon me i do not mean to read and they would go and kiss dead caesar's wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood  yea beg a hair of him for memory and dying mention it within their wills bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue have patience gentle friends i must not read it it is not meet you know how caesar loved you you are not wood you are not stones but men and being men hearing the will of caesar it will inflame you it will make you mad 'tis good you know not that you are his heirs for if you should o what would come of it will you be patient will you stay awhile i have o'ershot myself to tell you of it i fear i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed caesar i do fear it you will compel me then to read the will then make a ring about the corpse of caesar and let me show you him that made the will shall i descend and will you give me leave nay press not so upon me stand far off if you have tears prepare to shed them now you all do know this mantle i remember the first time ever caesar put it on 'twas on a summer's evening in his tent that day he overcame the nervii look in this place ran cassius' dagger through see what a rent the envious casca made through this the well belov\u00e8d brutus stabbed and as he plucked his curs\u00e8d steel away mark how the blood of caesar followed it as rushing out of doors to be resolved if brutus so unkindly knocked or no for brutus as you know was caesar's angel judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors' arms quite vanquished him then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling up his face even at the base of pompey's statue which all the while ran blood great caesar fell o what a fall was there my countrymen then i and you and all of us fell down whilst bloody treason flourished over us o now you weep and i perceive you feel the dint of pity these are gracious drops kind souls what weep you when you but behold our caesar's vesture wounded look you here here is himself marred as you see with traitors stay countrymen good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny they that have done this deed are honorable what private griefs they have alas i know not that made them do it they are wise and honorable and will no doubt with reasons answer you i come not friends to steal away your hearts i am no orator as brutus is but as you know me all a plain blunt man that love my friend and that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of him for i have neither wit nor words nor worth action nor utterance nor the power of speech to stir men's blood i only speak right on i tell you that which you yourselves do know show you sweet caesar's wounds poor poor dumb mouths and bid them speak for me but were i brutus and brutus antony there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of caesar that should move the stones of rome to rise and mutiny yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak why friends you go to do you know not what wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves alas you know not i must tell you then you have forgot the will i told you of here is the will and under caesar's seal to every roman citizen he gives to every several man seventy five drachmas hear me with patience moreover he hath left you all his walks his private arbors and new planted orchards on this side tiber he hath left them you and to your heirs forever common pleasures to walk abroad and recreate yourselves here was a caesar when comes such another now let it work mischief thou art afoot take thou what course thou wilt how now fellow where is he and thither will i straight to visit him he comes upon a wish fortune is merry and in this mood will give us anything belike they had some notice of the people how i had moved them bring me to octavius these many then shall die their names are pricked he shall not live look with a spot i damn him but lepidus go you to caesar's house fetch the will hither and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies this is a slight unmeritable man meet to be sent on errands is it fit the threefold world divided he should stand one of the three to share it octavius i have seen more days than you and though we lay these honors on this man to ease ourselves of diverse sland'rous loads he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold to groan and sweat under the business either led or driven as we point the way and having brought our treasure where we will then take we down his load and turn him off like to the empty ass to shake his ears and graze in commons so is my horse octavius and for that i do appoint him store of provender it is a creature that i teach to fight to wind to stop to run directly on his corporal motion governed by my spirit and in some taste is lepidus but so he must be taught and trained and bid go forth  a barren spirited fellow one that feeds on objects arts and imitations which out of use and staled by other men begin his fashion do not talk of him but as a property and now octavius listen great things brutus and cassius are levying powers we must straight make head therefore let our alliance be combined our best friends made our means stretched and let us presently go sit in council how covert matters may be best disclosed and open perils surest answer\u00e8d tut i am in their bosoms and i know wherefore they do it they could be content to visit other places and come down with fearful bravery thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage but 'tis not so octavius lead your battle softly on upon the left hand of the even field why do you cross me in this exigent no caesar we will answer on their charge make forth the generals would have some words in your bad strokes brutus you give good words witness the hole you made in caesar's heart crying long live hail caesar not stingless too villains you did not so when your vile daggers hacked one another in the sides of caesar you showed your teeth like apes and fawned like hounds and bowed like bondmen kissing caesar's feet whilst damn\u00e8d casca like a cur behind struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers old cassius still where is he this is not brutus friend but i assure you a prize no less in worth keep this man safe give him all kindness i had rather have such men my friends than enemies go on and see whe'er brutus be alive or dead and bring us word unto octavius' tent how everything is chanced this was the noblest roman of them all all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar he only in a general honest thought and common good to all made one of them his life was gentle and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world this was a man", "Ado_Leonato": "i learn in this letter that don pedro of aragon comes this night to messina how many gentlemen have you lost in this action a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers i find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young florentine called claudio he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it did he break out into tears a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces truer than those that are so washed how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping what is he that you ask for niece faith niece you tax signior benedick too much but he'll be meet with you i doubt it not you must not sir mistake my niece there is a kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them you will never run mad niece never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave her mother hath many times told me so signior benedick no for then were you a child if you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to the prince your brother i owe you all duty please it your grace lead on how now brother where is my cousin your son hath he provided this music are they good hath the fellow any wit that told you this no no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but i will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true go you and tell her of it cousins you know what you have to do o i cry you mercy friend go you with me and i will use your skill good cousin have a care this busy time was not count john here at supper then half signior benedick's tongue in count john's mouth and half count john's melancholy in signior benedick's face  by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue so by being too curst god will send you no horns you may light on a husband that hath no beard well then go you into hell well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband daughter remember what i told you if the prince do solicit you in that kind you know your answer cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly the revelers are entering brother make good room count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match and all grace say amen to it niece will you look to those things i told you of there's little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit o lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad not till monday my dear son which is hence a just sevennight and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights' watchings no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it what effects my lord she will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how i would have sworn it had my lord especially against benedick no and swears she never will that's her torment this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for she'll be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her i measure him says she by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometimes afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian were it good think you if he do fear god he must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling nay that's impossible she may wear her heart out first my lord will you walk dinner is ready so say i methinks you are sadder where is but a humor or a worm indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard what would you with me honest neighbor brief i pray you for you see it is a busy time with me what is it my good friends neighbors you are tedious all thy tediousness on me ah i would fain know what you have to say indeed neighbor he comes too short of you i must leave you take their examination yourself and bring it me i am now in great haste as it may appear unto you drink some wine ere you go fare you well i'll wait upon them i am ready come friar francis be brief only to the plain form of marriage and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards to be married to her friar you come to marry her i dare make his answer none as freely son as god did give her me what do you mean my lord dear my lord if you in your own proof have vanquished the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity  sweet prince why speak not you are these things spoken or do i but dream all this is so but what of this my lord i charge thee do so as thou art my child hath no man's dagger here a point for me o fate take not away thy heavy hand death is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wished for dost thou look up wherefore why doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her could she here deny the story that is printed in her blood  do not live hero do not ope thine eyes for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rearward of reproaches strike at thy life grieved i i had but one chid i for that at frugal nature's frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggar's issue at my gates who smirch\u00e8d thus and mired with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised and mine that i was proud on mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of her why she o she is fall'n into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foul tainted flesh confirmed confirmed o that is stronger made which was before barred up with ribs of iron would the two princes lie and claudio lie who loved her so that speaking of her foulness washed it with tears hence from her let her die friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness i know not if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honor the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awaked in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly what shall become of this what will this do being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me i pray thee cease thy counsel which falls into mine ears as profitless as water in a sieve give not me counsel nor let no comforter delight mine ear but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine bring me a father that so loved his child whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine and bid him speak of patience measure his woe the length and breadth of mine and let it answer every strain for strain as thus for thus and such a grief for such in every lineament branch shape and form if such a one will smile and stroke his beard bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk with candle wasters bring him yet to me and i of him will gather patience but there is no such man for brother men can counsel and speak comfort to that grief which they themselves not feel but tasting it their counsel turns to passion which before would give preceptial med'cine to rage fetter strong madness in a silken thread charm ache with air and agony with words no no 'tis all men's office to speak patience to those that wring under the load of sorrow but no man's virtue nor sufficiency to be so moral when he shall endure the like himself therefore give me no counsel my griefs cry louder than advertisement i pray thee peace i will be flesh and blood for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently however they have writ the style of gods and made a push at chance and sufferance there thou speak'st reason nay i will do so my soul doth tell me hero is belied and that shall claudio know so shall the prince and all of them that thus dishonor her hear you my lords  some haste my lord well fare you well my lord are you so hasty now well all is one marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword i fear thee not tush tush

those cheeks so foul a sky clears not without a storm pour down thy weather how goes all in france o where hath our intelligence been drunk where hath it slept where is my mother's care that such an army could be drawn in france and she not hear of it withhold thy speed dreadful occasion o make a league with me till i have pleased my discontented peers what mother dead how wildly then walks my

my mother dead five moons why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears why urgest thou so oft young arthur's death thy hand hath murdered him i had a mighty cause to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him it is the curse of kings to be attended by slaves that take their humors for a warrant to break within the bloody house of life and on the winking of authority to understand a law to know the meaning of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns more upon humor than advised respect o when the last accompt twixt heaven and earth is to be made then shall this hand and seal witness against us to damnation how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by a fellow by the hand of nature marked quoted and signed to do a deed of shame this murder had not come into my mind but taking note of thy abhorred aspect finding thee fit for bloody villainy apt liable to be employed in danger i faintly broke with thee of arthur's death and thou to be endear\u00e8d to a king made it no conscience to destroy a prince hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause when i spake darkly what i purpos\u00e8d or turned an eye of doubt upon my face as bid me tell my tale in express words deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me but thou didst understand me by my signs and didst in signs again parley with sin yea without stop didst let thy heart consent and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed which both our tongues held vile to name out of my sight and never see me more my nobles leave me and my state is braved even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers nay in the body of this fleshly land this kingdom this confine of blood and breath hostility and civil tumult reigns between my conscience and my cousin's death doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers throw this report on their incens\u00e8d rage and make them tame to their obedience forgive the comment that my passion made upon thy feature for my rage was blind and foul imaginary eyes of blood presented thee more hideous than thou art o answer not but to my closet bring the angry lords with all expedient haste i conjure thee but slowly run more fast thus have i yielded up into your hand the circle of my glory now keep your holy word go meet the french and from his holiness use all your power to stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed our discontented counties do revolt our people quarrel with obedience swearing allegiance and the love of soul to stranger blood to foreign royalty this inundation of mistempered humor rests by you only to be qualified then pause not for the present time's so sick that present med'cine must be ministered or overthrow incurable ensues is this ascension day did not the prophet say that before ascension day at noon my crown i should give off even so i have i did suppose it should be on constraint but god be thanked it is but voluntary would not my lords

to dismiss the powers led by the dauphin have thou the ordering of this present time how goes the day with us o tell me hubert this fever that hath troubled me so long lies heavy on me o my heart is sick tell him toward swinstead to the abbey there ay me this tyrant fever burns me up and will not let me welcome this good news set on toward swinstead to my litter straight weakness possesseth me and i am faint ay marry now my soul hath elbow room it would not out at windows nor at doors there is so hot a summer in my bosom that all my bowels crumble up to dust i am a scribbled form drawn with a pen upon a parchment and against this fire do i shrink up poisoned ill fare dead forsook cast off and none of you will bid the winter come to thrust his icy fingers in my maw nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course through my burned bosom nor entreat the north to make his bleak winds kiss my parch\u00e8d lips and comfort me with cold i do not ask you much i beg cold comfort and you are so strait and so ingrateful you deny me that the salt in them is hot within me is a hell and there the poison is as a fiend confined to tyrannize on unreprievable condemn\u00e8d blood o cousin thou art come to set mine eye the tackle of my heart is cracked and burnt and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail are turn\u00e8d to one thread one little hair my heart hath one poor string to

shall happily meet to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms which now we hold at much uncertainty yea but a little charge will trench him here and on this north side win this cape of land and then he runs straight and even in faith my lord you are too willful blame and since your coming hither have done enough to put him quite besides his patience you must needs learn lord to amend this fault though sometimes it show greatness courage blood  and that's the dearest grace it renders you  yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage defect of manners want of government pride haughtiness opinion

been here the quality and hair of our attempt brooks no division it will be thought by some that know not why he is away that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike of our proceedings kept the earl from hence and think how such an apprehension may turn the tide of fearful faction and breed a kind of question in our cause for well you know we of the off'ring side must keep aloof from strict

the dangers of the time you swore to us and you did swear that oath at doncaster that you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state nor claim no further than your new fall'n right the seat of gaunt dukedom of lancaster to this we swore our aid but in short space it rained down fortune show'ring on your head and such a flood of greatness fell on you  what with our help what with the absent king what with the injuries of a wanton time the seeming sufferances that you had borne and the contrarious winds that held the king so long in his unlucky irish wars that all in england did repute him dead  and from this swarm of fair advantages you took occasion to be quickly wooed to gripe the general sway into your hand forgot your oath to us at doncaster and being fed by us you used us so as that ungentle gull the cuckoo's bird useth the sparrow did oppress our nest grew by our feeding to so great a bulk that even our love durst not come near your sight for fear of swallowing but with nimble wing we were enforced for safety sake to fly out of your sight and raise this present head whereby we stand oppos\u00e8d by such means as you yourself have forged against yourself by unkind

undone it is not possible it cannot be the king should keep his word in loving us he will suspect us still and find a time to punish this offense in other faults suspicion all our lives shall be stuck

of his oath breaking which he mended thus by now forswearing that he is forsworn he calls us rebels traitors and will scourge with haughty arms this hateful name in us the prince of wales stepped

all the walls with painted imagery had said at once jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke whilst he from the one side to the other turning bareheaded lower than his proud steed's neck bespake them

sweat say this becomes him  as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemish yet must antony no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness if he filled his vacancy with his voluptuousness full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him for 't but to confound such time that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud as his own state and ours

and all the unlawful issue that their lust since then hath made between them unto her he gave the stablishment of egypt made her of lower syria cyprus lydia absolute queen i' th' common showplace where they exercise his sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings great media parthia and armenia he gave to alexander to ptolemy he assigned syria cilicia and phoenicia she in th' habiliments of the goddess isis that day appeared and oft before gave audience as 'tis reported so the people knows it and have now received his accusations caesar and that having in sicily sextus pompeius spoiled we had not rated him his part o' th' isle then does he say he lent me some shipping unrestored lastly he frets that lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposed and being that we detain all his revenue 'tis done already and the messenger gone i have told him lepidus was grown too cruel that he his high authority abused and did deserve his change for what i have conquered i grant him part but then in his armenia and other of his conquered kingdoms i demand the like nor must not then be yielded to in this that ever i should call thee castaway why have you stol'n upon us thus you come not like caesar's sister the wife of antony should have an army for an usher and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear the trees by th' way should have borne men and expectation fainted longing for what it had not nay the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven raised by your populous troops but you are come a market maid to rome and have prevented the ostentation of our love which left unshown is often left unloved we should have met you by sea and land supplying every stage with an augmented greeting which soon he granted being an abstract 'tween his lust and him i have eyes upon him and his affairs come to me on the wind where is he now no my most wrong\u00e8d sister cleopatra hath nodded him to her he hath given his empire up to a whore who

forth till we perceived both how you were wrong led and we in negligent danger cheer your heart be you not troubled with the time which drives o'er your content these strong necessities but let determined things to destiny hold unbewailed their way welcome to rome nothing more dear to me you are abused beyond the mark of thought and the high gods to do you justice makes his ministers of us and those that love you best of comfort and ever welcome to us most certain sister welcome pray you be ever known to patience my dear'st sister taurus strike not by land keep whole provoke not battle till we have done at sea do not exceed the prescript of this scroll our fortune lies upon this jump let him appear that's come from antony know you him approach and speak be 't so declare thine office for antony i have no ears to his request the queen of audience nor desire shall fail so she from egypt drive her all disgrac\u00e8d friend or take his life there this if she perform she shall not sue unheard so to them both bring him through the bands to try thy eloquence now 'tis time dispatch from antony win cleopatra promise and in our name what she requires add more from thine invention offers women are not in their best fortunes strong but want will perjure the ne'er touched vestal try thy cunning thidias make thine own edict for thy pains which we will answer as a law observe how antony becomes his flaw and what thou think'st his very action speaks in every power that moves he calls me boy and chides as he had power to beat me out of egypt my messenger he hath whipped with rods dares me to personal combat caesar to antony let the old ruffian know i have many other ways to die meantime laugh at his challenge let our best heads know that tomorrow the last of many battles we mean to fight within our files there are of those that served mark antony but late enough to fetch him in see it done and feast the army we have store to do 't and they have earned the waste poor antony go forth agrippa and begin the fight our will is antony be took alive make it so known the time of universal peace is near prove this a prosp'rous day the three nooked world shall bear the olive freely go charge agrippa plant those that have revolted in the vant that antony may seem to spend his fury upon himself but being charged we will be still by land  which as i take 't we shall for his best force is forth to man his galleys to the vales and hold our best advantage go to him dolabella bid him yield being so frustrate tell him he mocks the pauses that he makes wherefore is that and what art thou that dar'st appear thus to us what is 't thou say'st the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack the round world should have shook lions into civil streets and citizens to their dens the death of antony is not a single doom in the name lay a moiety of the world look you sad friends the gods rebuke me but it is tidings to wash the eyes of kings o antony i have followed thee to this but we do lance diseases in our bodies i must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day or look on thine we could not stall together in the whole world but yet let me lament with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts that thou my brother my competitor in top of all design my mate in empire friend and companion in the front of war the arm of mine own body and the heart where mine his thoughts did kindle that our stars unreconciliable should divide our equalness to this hear me good friends  but i will tell you at some meeter season the business of this man looks out of him we'll hear him what he says whence are you bid her have good heart she soon shall know of us by some of ours how honorable and how kindly we determine for her for caesar cannot live to be ungentle come hither proculeius go and say we purpose her no shame give her what comforts the quality of her passion shall require lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke she do defeat us for her life in rome would be eternal in our triumph go and with your speediest bring us what she says and how you find of her gallus go you along where's dolabella to second proculeius let him alone for i remember now how he's employed he shall in time be ready go with me to my tent where you shall see how hardly i was drawn into this war how calm and gentle i proceeded still in all my writings go with me and see what i can show in this which is the queen of egypt arise you shall not kneel i pray you rise rise egypt take to you no hard thoughts the record of what injuries you did us though written in our flesh we shall remember as things but done by chance cleopatra know we will extenuate rather than enforce if you apply yourself to our intents which towards you are most gentle you shall find a

died for her physician tells me she hath pursued conclusions infinite of easy ways to die take up her bed and bear her women from the monument she shall be buried by her antony no grave upon the earth

thunder's crack or lightning flash advanced above pale envy's threat'ning reach as when the golden sun salutes the morn and having gilt the ocean with his beams gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach and overlooks the highest peering hills so tamora upon her wit doth earthly honor wait and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown then aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress and mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long hast prisoner held fettered in amorous chains and faster bound to aaron's charming eyes than is prometheus tied to caucasus away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts i will be bright and shine in pearl and gold to wait upon this new made emperess to wait said i to wanton with this queen this goddess this semiramis this nymph this siren that will charm rome's saturnine and see his shipwrack and his commonweal's holla what storm is this clubs clubs these lovers will not keep the peace why how now lords so near the emperor's palace dare you draw and maintain such a quarrel openly full well i wot the ground of all this grudge i would not for a million of gold the cause were known to them it most concerns nor would your noble mother for much more be so dishonored in the court of rome for shame put up away i say now by the gods that warlike goths adore this petty brabble will undo us all why lords and think you not how dangerous it is to jet upon a prince's right what is lavinia then become so loose or bassianus so degenerate that for her love such quarrels may be broached without controlment justice or revenge young lords beware and should the empress know this discord's ground the music would not please why are you mad or know you not in rome how furious and impatient they be and cannot brook competitors in love i tell you lords you do but plot your deaths by this device to achieve her how ay and as good as saturninus may why then it seems some certain snatch or so would serve your turns would you had hit it too then should not we be tired with this ado why hark you hark you and are you such fools to square for this would it offend you then that both should speed for shame be friends and join for that you jar 'tis policy and stratagem must do that you affect and so must you resolve that what you cannot as you would achieve you must perforce accomplish as you may take this of me lucrece was not more chaste than this lavinia bassianus' love a speedier course than ling'ring languishment must we pursue and i have found the path my lords a solemn hunting is in hand there will the lovely roman ladies troop the forest walks are wide and spacious and many unfrequented plots there are fitted by kind for rape and villainy single you thither then this dainty doe and strike her home by force if not by words this way or not at all stand you in hope come come our empress with her sacred wit to villainy and vengeance consecrate will we acquaint withal what we intend and she shall file our engines with advice that will not suffer you to square yourselves but to your wishes' height advance you both the emperor's court is like the house of fame the palace full of tongues of eyes and ears the woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull there speak and strike brave boys and take your turns there serve your lust shadowed from heaven's eye and revel in lavinia's treasury he that had wit would think that i had none to bury so much gold under a tree and never after to inherit it let him that thinks of me so abjectly know that this gold must coin a stratagem which cunningly effected will beget a very excellent piece of villainy and so repose sweet gold for their unrest that have their alms out of the empress' chest madam though venus govern your desires saturn is dominator over mine what signifies my deadly standing eye my silence and my cloudy melancholy my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls even as an adder when she doth unroll to do some fatal execution no madam these are no venereal signs vengeance is in my heart death in my hand blood and revenge are hammering in my head hark tamora the empress of my soul which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee this is the day of doom for bassianus his philomel must lose her tongue today thy sons make pillage of her chastity and wash their hands in bassianus' blood seest thou this letter take it up i pray thee and give the king this fatal plotted scroll now question me no more we are espied here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty which dreads not yet their lives' destruction no more great empress bassianus comes be cross with him and i'll go fetch thy sons to back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they be come on my lords the better foot before straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit where i espied the panther fast asleep now will i fetch the king to find them here that he thereby may have a likely guess how these were they that made away his brother my gracious lord here is the bag of gold titus andronicus my lord the emperor sends thee this word that if thou love thy sons let marcus lucius or thyself old titus or any one of you chop off your hand and send it to the king he for the same will send thee hither both thy sons alive and that shall be the ransom for their fault nay come agree whose hand shall go along for fear they die before their pardon come if that be called deceit i will be honest and never whilst i live deceive men so but i'll deceive you in another sort and that you'll say ere half an hour pass i go andronicus and for thy hand look by and by to have thy sons with thee their heads i mean o how this villainy doth fat me with the very thoughts of it let fools do good and fair men call for grace aaron will have his soul black like his face ay some mad message from his mad grandfather ay just a verse in horace right you have it now what a thing it is to be an ass here's no sound jest the old man hath found their guilt and sends them weapons wrapped about with lines that wound beyond their feeling to the quick but were our witty empress well afoot she would applaud andronicus' conceit but let her rest in her unrest awhile  and now young lords was 't not a happy star led us to rome strangers and more than so captives to be advanc\u00e8d to this height it did me good before the palace gate to brave the tribune in his brother's hearing had he not

aaron is and what with aaron now why what a caterwauling dost thou keep what dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms to whom well god give her good rest what hath he sent her why then she is the devil's dam a joyful issue zounds you whore is black so base a hue sweet blowse you are a beauteous blossom sure that which thou canst not undo villain i have done thy mother it shall not die what must it nurse then let no man but i do execution on my flesh and blood sooner this sword shall plow thy bowels up stay murderous villains will you kill your brother now by the burning tapers of the sky that shone so brightly when this boy was got he dies upon my scimitar's sharp point that touches this my firstborn son and heir i tell you younglings not enceladus with all his threat'ning band of typhon's brood nor great alcides nor the god of war shall seize this prey out of his father's hands what what you sanguine shallow hearted boys you white limed walls you alehouse painted signs coal black is better than another hue in that it scorns to bear another hue for all the water in the ocean can never turn the swan's black legs to white although she lave them hourly in the flood tell the empress from me i am of age to keep mine own excuse it how she can my mistress is my mistress this myself the vigor and the picture of my youth this before all the world do i prefer this maugre all the world will i keep safe or some of you shall smoke for it in rome why there's the privilege your beauty bears fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing the close enacts and counsels of thy heart here's a young lad framed of another leer look how the black slave smiles upon the father as who should say old lad i am thine own he is your brother lords sensibly fed of that self blood that first gave life to you and from that womb where you imprisoned were he is enfranchis\u00e8d and come to light nay he is your brother by the surer side although my seal be stamp\u00e8d in his face then sit we down and let us all consult my son and i will have the wind of you keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety why so brave lords when we join in league i am a lamb but if you brave the moor the chaf\u00e8d boar the mountain lioness the ocean swells not so as aaron storms but say again how many saw the child the empress the midwife and yourself two may keep counsel when the third's away go to the empress tell her this i said wheak wheak so cries a pig prepar\u00e8d to the spit o lord sir 'tis a deed of policy shall she live to betray this guilt of ours a long tongued babbling gossip no lords no and now be it known to you my full intent not far one muliteus my countryman his wife but yesternight was brought to bed his child is like to her fair as you are go pack with him and give the mother gold and tell them both the circumstance of all and how by this their child shall be advanced and be receiv\u00e8d for the emperor's heir and substituted in the place of mine to calm this tempest whirling in the court and let the emperor dandle him for his own hark you lords you see i have given her physic and you must needs bestow her funeral the fields are near and you are gallant grooms this done see that you take no longer days but send the midwife presently to me the midwife and the nurse well made away then let the ladies tattle what they please now to the goths as swift as swallow flies there to dispose this treasure in mine arms and secretly to greet the empress' friends  come on you thick lipped slave i'll bear you hence for it is you that puts us to our shifts i'll make you feed on berries and on roots and feed on curds and whey and suck the goat and cabin in a cave and bring you up to be a warrior and command a camp touch not the boy he is of royal blood lucius save the child and bear it from me to the empress if thou do this i'll show thee wondrous things that highly may advantage thee to hear if thou wilt not befall what may befall i'll speak no more but vengeance rot you all and if it please thee why assure thee lucius 'twill vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak for i must talk of murders rapes and massacres acts of black night abominable deeds complots of mischief treason villainies ruthful to hear yet piteously performed and this shall all be buried in my death unless thou swear to me my child shall live swear that he shall and then i will begin what if i do not as indeed i do not yet for i know thou art religious and hast a thing within thee call\u00e8d conscience with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies which i have seen thee careful to observe therefore i urge thy oath for that i know an idiot holds his bauble for a god and keeps the oath which by that god he swears to that i'll urge him therefore thou shalt vow by that same god what god soe'er it be that thou adorest and hast in reverence to save my boy to nourish and bring him up or else i will discover naught to thee first know thou i begot him on the empress tut lucius this was but a deed of charity to that which thou shalt hear of me anon 'twas her two sons that murdered bassianus they cut thy sister's tongue and ravished her and cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest why she was washed and cut and trimmed and 'twas trim sport for them which had the doing of it indeed i was their tutor to instruct them that codding spirit had they from their mother as sure a card as ever won the set that bloody mind i think they learned of me as true a dog as ever fought at head well let my deeds be witness of my worth i trained thy brethren to that guileful hole where the dead corpse of bassianus lay i wrote the letter that thy father found and hid the gold within that letter mentioned confederate with the queen and her two sons and what not done that thou hast cause to rue wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it i played the cheater for thy father's hand and when i had it drew myself apart and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter i pried me through the crevice of a wall when for his hand he had his two sons' heads beheld his tears and laughed so heartily that both mine eyes were rainy like to his and when i told the empress of this sport she sounded almost at my pleasing tale and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses ay like a black dog as the saying is ay that i had not done a thousand more even now i curse the day and yet i think few come within the compass of my curse  wherein i did not some notorious ill as kill a man or else devise his death ravish a maid or plot the way to do it accuse some innocent and forswear myself set deadly enmity between two friends make poor men's cattle break their necks set fire on barns and haystalks in the night and bid the owners quench them with their tears oft have i digged up dead men from their graves and set them upright at their dear friends' door even when their sorrows almost was forgot and on their skins as on the bark of trees have with my knife carv\u00e8d in roman letters let not your sorrow die though i am dead but i have done a thousand dreadful things as willingly as one would kill a fly and nothing grieves me heartily indeed but that i cannot do ten thousand more if there be devils would i were a devil to live and burn in everlasting fire so i might have your company in hell but to torment you with my bitter tongue some devil whisper curses in my ear and prompt me that my tongue may utter forth the venomous malice of my swelling heart ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb i am no baby i that with base prayers i should repent the evils i have done ten thousand worse than ever yet i did would i perform if i might have my will if one good deed in all my life i did i do repent it from my very soul", "Lr_Cornwall": "dear sir forbear how now my

his own pride and purposes evades them with a bombast circumstance horribly stuffed with epithets of war and in conclusion nonsuits my mediators for certes says he i have already chose my officer and what was he forsooth a great arithmetician one michael cassio a florentine a fellow almost damned in a fair wife that never set a squadron in the field nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric wherein the tog\u00e8d consuls can propose as masterly as he mere prattle without practice is all his soldiership but he sir had th' election and i of whom his eyes

shall mark many a duteous and knee crooking knave that doting on his own obsequious bondage wears out his time much like his master's ass for naught but provender and when he's old cashiered whip me

arise arise awake the snorting citizens with the bell or else the devil will make a grandsire of you arise i say zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve god if the devil bid you because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians you'll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse you'll have your nephews neigh to you you'll have coursers for cousins and jennets for

place to be producted as if i stay i shall against the moor for i do know the state however this may gall him with some check cannot with safety cast him for he's embarked with such loud reason to the

present life i must show out a flag and sign of love  which is indeed but sign that you shall surely find him lead to the sagittary the rais\u00e8d search and there will i be with him so farewell though in the trade of war i have slain men yet do i hold it very stuff o' th' conscience to do no contrived murder i lack iniquity sometimes to do me service nine or ten times i had thought t' have yerked him here under the ribs nay but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honor that with the little godliness i have i did full hard forbear him but i pray you sir are you fast married be assured of this that the magnifico is much beloved and hath in his effect a voice potential as double as the duke's he will divorce you or put upon you what restraint or grievance

noble heart why go to bed and sleep if thou dost i shall never love thee after why thou silly gentleman o villainous i have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i would change my humanity with a baboon virtue a fig 'tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts  whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favor with an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy purse  nor he his to her it was a violent commencement in her and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse these moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her thou art sure of me go make money i have told thee often and i retell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this tomorrow adieu at my lodging go to farewell do you hear roderigo no more of drowning do you hear go to farewell put money enough in your purse thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gained knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets 'has done my office i know not if 't be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety he holds me well the better shall my purpose work on him cassio's a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery how how let's see after some time to abuse othello's ear that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected framed to make women false the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so and will as tenderly be led by th' nose as asses are i have 't it is engendered hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light sir would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me you would have enough in faith too much i find it still when i have list to sleep marry before your ladyship i grant she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking come on come on you are pictures out of door bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens saints in your injuries devils being offended players in your huswifery and huswives in your beds nay it is true or else i am a turk you rise to play and go to bed to work no let me not o gentle lady do not put me to 't for i am nothing if not critical ay madam i am about it but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze it plucks out brains and all but my muse labors and thus she is delivered if she be fair and wise fairness and wit the one's for use the other useth it if she be black and thereto have a wit she'll find a white that shall her blackness hit she never yet was foolish that was fair for even her folly helped her to an heir there's none so foul and foolish thereunto but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do she that was ever fair and never proud had tongue at will and yet was never loud never lacked gold and yet went never gay fled from her wish and yet said now i may she that being angered her revenge being nigh bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod's head for the salmon's tail she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind see suitors following and not look behind she was a wight if ever such wight were  to suckle fools and chronicle small beer he takes her by the palm ay well said whisper with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship you say true 'tis so indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in very good well kissed an excellent courtesy 'tis so indeed yet again your fingers to your lips would they were clyster pipes for your sake the moor i know his trumpet o you are well tuned now but i'll set down the pegs that make this music as honest as i am do thou meet me presently at the harbor come hither if thou be'st valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first i must tell thee this desdemona is directly in love with him lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed mark me with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favor sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already blessed fig's end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark that lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together villainous thoughts roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise th' incorporate conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me i have brought you from venice watch you tonight for the command i'll lay 't upon you cassio knows you not i'll not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favorably minister sir he's rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell that cassio loves her i do well believe 't that she loves him 'tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think he'll prove to desdemona a most dear husband now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leaped into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am evened with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment cannot cure which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trace for his quick hunting stand the putting on i'll have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my nightcap too make the moor thank me love me and reward me for making him egregiously an ass and practicing upon his peace and quiet even to madness 'tis here but yet confused knavery's plain face is never seen till used not this hour lieutenant 'tis not yet ten o' th' clock our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for jove and i'll warrant her full of game what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley to provocation and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love well happiness to their sheets come lieutenant i have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello o they are our friends but one cup i'll drink for you what man 'tis a night of revels the gallants desire it here at the door i pray you call them in if i can fasten but one cup upon him with that which he hath drunk tonight already he'll be as full of quarrel and offense as my young mistress' dog now my sick fool roderigo whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out to desdemona hath tonight caroused potations pottle deep and he's to watch three else of cyprus noble swelling spirits that hold their honors in a wary distance the very elements of this warlike isle have i tonight flustered with flowing cups and they watch too now 'mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the isle but here they come if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely both with wind and stream some wine ho and let me the cannikin clink clink and let me the cannikin clink a soldier's a man o man's life's but a span why then let a soldier drink some wine boys i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting your dane your german and your swag bellied hollander drink ho are nothing to your english why he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled o sweet england king stephen was and a worthy peer his breeches cost him but a crown he held them sixpence all too dear with that he called the tailor lown he was a wight of high renown and thou art but of low degree 'tis pride that pulls the country down then take thy auld cloak about thee some wine ho will you hear 't again it's true good lieutenant and so do i too lieutenant you see this fellow that is gone before he's a soldier fit to stand by caesar and give direction and do but see his vice 'tis to his virtue a just equinox the one as long as th' other 'tis pity of him i fear the trust othello puts him in on some odd time of his infirmity will shake this island 'tis evermore the prologue to his sleep he'll watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle how now roderigo i pray you after the lieutenant go not i for this fair island i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evil but hark what noise away i say go out and cry a mutiny nay good lieutenant god's will gentlemen  help ho lieutenant sir montano sir  help masters here's a goodly watch indeed who's that which rings the bell diablo ho the town will rise god's will lieutenant hold you will be shamed forever hold ho lieutenant sir montano gentlemen  have you forgot all sense of place and duty hold the general speaks to you hold for shame i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom divesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and tilting one at other's breast in opposition bloody i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offense to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamor as it so fell out  the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i returned the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till tonight i ne'er might say before when i came back  for this was brief i found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass what are you hurt lieutenant marry god forbid as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and he's yours what was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to you is 't possible why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not so befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you you or any man living may be drunk at a time man i'll tell you what you shall do our general's wife is now the general i may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch and what's he then that says i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for 'tis most easy th' inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit she's framed as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moor were 't to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeem\u00e8d sin  his soul is so enfettered to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortune and she for him pleads strongly to the moor i'll pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her body's lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all how now roderigo how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time does 't not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashiered cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by th' mass 'tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short retire thee go where thou art billeted away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress i'll set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay that's the way dull not device by coldness and delay you have not been abed then i'll send her to you presently and i'll devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way that your converse and business may be more free well my good lord i'll do 't ha i like not that nothing my lord or if i know not what cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it that he would steal away so guiltylike seeing your coming my noble lord  did michael cassio when you wooed my lady know of your love but for a satisfaction of my thought no further harm i did not think he had been acquainted with her indeed honest my lord my lord for aught i know think my lord my lord you know i love you for michael cassio i dare be sworn i think that he is honest men should be what they seem or those that be not would they might seem none why then i think cassio's an honest man good my lord pardon me though i am bound to every act of duty i am not bound to that all slaves are free to utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false  as where's that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not who has that breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and law days and in sessions sit with meditations lawful i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guess  as i confess it is my nature's plague to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy shapes faults that are not that your wisdom from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty and wisdom to let you know my thoughts good name in man and woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash 'tis something nothing 'twas mine 'tis his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed you cannot if my heart were in your hand nor shall not whilst 'tis in my custody o beware my lord of jealousy it is the green eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger but o what damn\u00e8d minutes tells he o'er who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves poor and content is rich and rich enough but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor good god the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy i am glad of this for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore as i am bound receive it from me i speak not yet of proof look to your wife observe her well with cassio wear your eyes thus not jealous nor secure i would not have your free and noble nature out of self bounty be abused look to 't i know our country disposition well in venice they do let god see the pranks they dare not show their husbands their best conscience is not to leave 't undone but keep 't unknown she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seemed to shake and fear your looks she loved them most why go to then she that so young could give out such a seeming to seel her father's eyes up close as oak he thought 'twas witchcraft but i am much to blame i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you i see this hath a little dashed your spirits i' faith i fear it has i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love but i do see you're moved i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion should you do so my lord my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aim not at cassio's my worthy friend my lord i see you're moved long live she so and long live you to think so ay there's the point as to be bold with you not to affect many propos\u00e8d matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends  foh one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproportion thoughts unnatural  but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her though i may fear her will recoiling to her better judgment may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent my lord i take my leave my lord i would i might entreat your honor to scan this thing no farther leave it to time although 'tis fit that cassio have his place  for sure he fills it up with great ability  yet if you please to hold him off awhile you shall by that perceive him and his means note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity much will be seen in that in the meantime let me be thought too busy in my fears  as worthy cause i have to fear i am  and hold her free i do beseech your honor i once more take my leave how now what do you here alone you have a thing for me it is a common thing  to have a foolish wife what handkerchief hast stol'n it from her a good wench give it me why what is that to you be not acknown on 't i have use for it go leave me i will in cassio's lodging lose this napkin and let him find it trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ this may do something the moor already changes with my poison dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons which at the first are scarce found to distaste but with a little act upon the blood burn like the mines of sulfur i did say so look where he comes not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday why how now general no more of that how now my lord i am sorry to hear this is 't possible my lord is 't come to this my noble lord  o grace o heaven forgive me are you a man have you a soul or sense god b' wi' you take mine office o wretched fool that liv'st to make thine honesty a vice  o monstrous world take note take note o world to be direct and honest is not safe  i thank you for this profit and from hence i'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense i should be wise for honesty's a fool and loses that it works for i see you are eaten up with passion i do repent me that i put it to you you would be satisfied and may but how how satisfied my lord would you the supervisor grossly gape on behold her topped it were a tedious difficulty i think to bring them to that prospect damn them then if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own what then how then what shall i say where's satisfaction it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk but yet i say if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction you might have 't i do not like the office but sith i am entered in this cause so far pricked to 't by foolish honesty and love i will go on i lay with cassio lately and being troubled with a raging tooth i could not sleep there are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs one of this kind is cassio in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona let us be wary let us hide our loves and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand cry o sweet creature then kiss me hard as if he plucked up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips then laid his leg o'er my thigh and sighed and kissed and then cried curs\u00e8d fate that gave thee to the moor nay this was but his dream and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly nay but be wise yet we see nothing done she may be honest yet tell me but this have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand i know not that but such a handkerchief  i am sure it was your wife's did i today see cassio wipe his beard with if it be that or any that was hers it speaks against her with the other proofs yet be content patience i say your mind perhaps may change do not rise yet witness you ever burning lights above you elements that clip us round about witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit hands heart to wronged othello's service let him command and to obey shall be in me remorse what bloody business ever my friend is dead 'tis done at your request but let her live i am your own forever there is no other way 'tis she must do 't and lo the happiness go and importune her is my lord angry can he be angry i have seen the cannon when it hath blown his ranks into the air and like the devil from his very arm puffed his own brother and is he angry something of moment then i will go meet him there's matter in 't indeed if he be angry will you think so what to kiss in private or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more not meaning any harm if they do nothing 'tis a venial slip but if i give my wife a handkerchief  why then 'tis hers my lord and being hers she may i think bestow 't on any man her honor is an essence that's not seen they have it very oft that have it not but for the handkerchief  ay what of that what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong or heard him say as knaves be such abroad who having by their own importunate suit or voluntary dotage of some mistress convinc\u00e8d or supplied them cannot choose but they must blab  he hath my lord but be you well assured no more than he'll unswear faith that he did i know not what he did lie  with her on her what you will work on my medicine work thus credulous fools are caught and many worthy and chaste dames even thus all guiltless meet reproach what ho my lord my lord i say othello how now cassio my lord is fall'n into an epilepsy this is his second fit he had one yesterday no forbear the lethargy must have his quiet course if not he foams at mouth and by and by breaks out to savage madness look he stirs do you withdraw yourself a little while he will recover straight when he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you how is it general have you not hurt your head i mock you not by heaven would you would bear your fortune like a man there's many a beast then in a populous city and many a civil monster good sir be a man think every bearded fellow that's but yoked may draw with you there's millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds which they dare swear peculiar your case is better o 'tis the spite of hell the fiend's arch mock to lip a wanton in a secure couch and to suppose her chaste no let me know and knowing what i am i know what she shall be stand you awhile apart confine yourself but in a patient list whilst you were here o'erwhelm\u00e8d with your grief  a passion most unsuiting such a man  cassio came hither i shifted him away and laid good 'scuses upon your ecstasy bade him anon return and here speak with me the which he promised do but encave yourself and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns that dwell in every region of his face for i will make him tell the tale anew  where how how oft how long ago and when he hath and is again to cope your wife i say but mark his gesture marry patience or i shall say you're all in all in spleen and nothing of a man that's not amiss but yet keep time in all will you withdraw now will i question cassio of bianca a huswife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature that dotes on cassio as 'tis the strumpet's plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one he when he hears of her cannot restrain from the excess of laughter here he comes as he shall smile othello shall go mad and his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassio's smiles gestures and light behaviors quite in the wrong how do you lieutenant ply desdemona well and you are sure on 't now if this suit lay in bianca's power how quickly should you speed i never knew woman love man so do you hear cassio she gives it out that you shall marry her do you intend it faith the cry goes that you marry her i am a very villain else before me look where she comes after her after her will you sup there well i may chance to see you for i would very fain speak with you go to say no more did you perceive how he laughed at his vice and did you see the handkerchief yours by this hand and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife she gave it him and he hath giv'n it his whore nay you must forget that nay that's not your way she's the worse for all this ay too gentle if you are so fond over her iniquity give her patent to offend for if it touch not you it comes near nobody o 'tis foul in her that's fouler do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even the bed she hath contaminated and for cassio let me be his undertaker you shall hear more by midnight i warrant something from venice 'tis lodovico this comes from the duke see your wife's with him i am very glad to see you signior welcome to cyprus lives sir he is much changed he's that he is i may not breathe my censure what he might be if what he might he is not i would to heaven he were 'faith that was not so well yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst alas alas it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known you shall observe him and his own courses will denote him so that i may save my speech do but go after and mark how he continues what is your pleasure madam how is 't with you what is the matter lady what name fair lady why did he so do not weep do not weep alas the day beshrew him for 't how comes this trick upon him fie there is no such man it is impossible speak within door you are a fool go to i pray you be content 'tis but his humor the business of the state does him offense and he does chide with you it is but so i warrant hark how these instruments summon to supper the messengers of venice stays the meat go in and weep not all things shall be well how now roderigo what in the contrary will you hear me roderigo you charge me most unjustly well go to very well very well you have said now why now i see there's mettle in thee and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before give me thy hand roderigo thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet i protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair i grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment but roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which i have greater reason to believe

is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othello's place o no he goes into mauritania and takes away with him the fair desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of cassio why by making him uncapable of othello's place knocking out his brains ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right he sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will i go to him he knows not yet of his honorable fortune if you will watch his going thence which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your pleasure i will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall between us come stand not amazed at it but go along with me i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him it is now high supper time and the night grows to waste about it and you shall be satisfied here stand behind this bulk straight will he come wear thy good rapier bare and put it home quick quick fear nothing i'll be at thy elbow it makes us or it mars us think on that and fix most firm thy resolution here at thy hand be bold and take thy stand i have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense and he grows angry now whether he kill cassio or cassio him or each do kill the other every way makes my gain live roderigo he calls me to a restitution large of gold and jewels that i bobbed from him as gifts to desdemona it must not be if cassio do remain he hath a daily beauty in his life that makes me ugly and besides the moor may unfold me to him there stand i in much peril no he must die be 't so i hear him coming who's there whose noise is this that cries on murder did not you hear a cry what's the matter what are you here that cry so grievously o me lieutenant

allowed in meaner parties  yet who than he more mean to knit their souls on whom there is no more dependency but brats and beggary in self figured knot yet you are curbed from that enlargement by the consequence o' th' crown and must not foil the precious note of it with a base slave a hilding for a livery a squire's cloth a pantler not so eminent the south fog rot him his garment now the devil  his garment you have abused me his meanest garment i will inform your father i'll be revenged his mean'st garment well there be many caesars ere such another julius britain's a world by itself and we will nothing pay for wearing our own noses come there's no more tribute to be paid our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and as i said there is no more such caesars other of them may have crooked noses but to owe such straight arms none we have yet many among us can grip as hard as cassibelan i do not say i am one but i have a hand why tribute why should we pay tribute if caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light else sir no more tribute pray you now his majesty bids you welcome make pastime with us a day or two or longer if you seek us afterwards in other terms you shall find us in our saltwater girdle if you beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in the adventure our crows shall fare the better for you and there's an end receive it friendly but from this time forth i wear it as your enemy 'tis all the better your valiant britons have their wishes in it that man of hers pisanio her old servant i have not seen these two days 'tis certain she is fled go in and cheer the king he rages none dare come about him i love and hate her for she's fair and royal and that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite than lady ladies woman from every one the best she hath and she of all compounded outsells them all i love her therefore but disdaining me and throwing favors on the low posthumus slanders so her judgment that what's else rare is choked and in that point i will conclude to hate her nay indeed to be revenged upon her for when fools shall who is here what are you packing sirrah come hither ah you precious pander villain where is thy lady in a word or else thou art straightway with the fiends where is thy lady or by jupiter  i will not ask again close villain i'll have this secret from thy heart or rip thy heart to find it is she with posthumus from whose so many weights of baseness cannot a dram of worth be drawn where is she sir come nearer no farther halting satisfy me home what is become of her all worthy villain discover where thy mistress is at once at the next word no more of worthy lord speak or thy silence on the instant is thy condemnation and thy death let's see 't i will pursue her even to augustus' throne humh sirrah is this letter true it is posthumus' hand i know 't sirrah if thou wouldst not be a villain but do me true service undergo those employments wherein i should have cause to use thee with a serious industry  that is what villainy soe'er i bid thee do to perform it directly and truly i would think thee an honest man thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment wilt thou serve me for since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar posthumus thou canst not in the course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of mine wilt thou serve me give me thy hand here's my purse hast any of thy late master's garments in thy possession the first service thou dost me fetch that suit hither let it be thy first service go meet thee at milford haven i forgot to ask him one thing i'll remember 't anon even there thou villain posthumus will i kill thee i would these garments were come she said upon a time  the bitterness of it i now belch from my heart  that she held the very garment of posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person together with the adornment of my qualities with that suit upon my back will i ravish her first kill him and in her eyes there shall she see my valor which will then be a torment to her contempt he on the ground my speech of insultment ended on his dead body and when my lust hath dined which as i say to vex her i will execute in the clothes that she so praised to the court i'll knock her back foot her home again she hath despised me rejoicingly and i'll be merry in my revenge be those the garments how long is 't since she went to milford haven bring this apparel to my chamber that is the second thing that i have commanded thee the third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design be but duteous and true preferment shall tender itself to thee my revenge is now at milford would i had wings to follow it

ravenous sense but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom and heavy gaited toads lie in their way doing annoyance to the treacherous feet which with usurping steps do trample thee yield stinging nettles to mine enemies and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a mortal touch throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies mock not my senseless conjuration lords this earth shall have a feeling and these stones prove arm\u00e8d soldiers ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellion's arms discomfortable cousin know'st thou not that when the searching eye of heaven is hid behind the globe that lights the lower world then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen in murders and in outrage boldly here but when from under this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole then murders treasons and detested sins the cloak of night being plucked from off their backs stand bare and naked trembling at themselves so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke who all this while hath reveled in the night whilst we were wand'ring with the antipodes shall see us rising in our throne the east his treasons will sit blushing in his face not able to endure the sight of day but self affrighted tremble at his sin not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king the breath of worldly men cannot depose the deputy elected by the lord for every man that bolingbroke hath pressed to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown god for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel then if angels fight weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right welcome my lord how far off lies your power but now the blood of twenty thousand men did triumph in my face and they are fled and till so much blood thither come again have i not reason to look pale and dead all souls that will be safe fly from my side for time hath set a blot upon my pride i had forgot myself am i not king awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest is not the king's name twenty thousand names arm arm my name a puny subject strikes at thy great glory look not to the ground you favorites of a king are we not high high be our thoughts i know my uncle york hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here mine ear is open and my heart prepared the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold say is my kingdom lost why 'twas my care and what loss is it to be rid of care strives bolingbroke to be as great as we greater he shall not be if he serve god we'll serve him too and be his fellow so revolt our subjects that we cannot mend they break their faith to god as well as us cry woe destruction ruin and decay the worst is death and death will have his day too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot what is become of bushy where is green that they have let the dangerous enemy measure our confines with such peaceful steps if we prevail their heads shall pay for it i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke o villains vipers damned without redemption dogs easily won to fawn on any man snakes in my heart blood warmed that sting my heart three judases each one thrice worse than judas would they make peace terrible hell make war upon their spotted souls for this no matter where of comfort no man speak let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth let's choose executors and talk of wills and yet not so for what can we bequeath save our depos\u00e8d bodies to the ground our lands our lives and all are bolingbroke's and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our bones for god's sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings  how some have been deposed some slain in war some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed some poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed all murdered for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp allowing him a breath a little scene to monarchize be feared and kill with looks infusing him with self and vain conceit as if this flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable and humored thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castle wall and farewell king cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence throw away respect tradition form and ceremonious duty for you have but mistook me all this while i live with bread like you feel want taste grief need friends subjected thus how can you say to me i am a king thou chid'st me well proud bolingbroke i come to change blows with thee for our day of doom  this ague fit of fear is overblown an easy task it is to win our own  say scroop where lies our uncle with his power speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour thou hast said enough beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth of that sweet way i was in to despair what say you now what comfort have we now by heaven i'll hate him everlastingly that bids me be of comfort anymore go to flint castle there i'll pine away a king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey that power i have discharge and let them go to ear the land that hath some hope to grow for i have none let no man speak again to alter this for counsel is but vain he does me double wrong that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue discharge my followers let them hence away from richard's night to bolingbroke's fair day we are amazed and thus long have we stood to watch the fearful bending of thy knee because we thought ourself thy lawful king an if we be how dare thy joints forget to pay their awful duty to our presence if we be not show us the hand of god that hath dismissed us from our stewardship for well we know no hand of blood and bone can gripe the sacred handle of our scepter unless he do profane steal or usurp and though you think that all as you have done have torn their souls by turning them from us and we are barren and bereft of friends yet know my master god omnipotent is mustering in his clouds on our behalf armies of pestilence and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of my precious crown tell bolingbroke for yon methinks he stands  that every stride he makes upon my land is dangerous treason he is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war but ere the crown he looks for live in peace ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons shall ill become the flower of england's face change the complexion of her maid pale peace to scarlet indignation and bedew her pastures' grass with faithful english blood northumberland say thus the king returns his noble cousin is right welcome hither and all the number of his fair demands shall be accomplished without contradiction with all the gracious utterance thou hast speak to his gentle hearing kind commends we do debase ourselves cousin do we not to look so poorly and to speak so fair shall we call back northumberland and send defiance to the traitor and so die o god o god that e'er this tongue of mine that laid the sentence of dread banishment on yon proud man should take it off again with words of sooth o that i were as great as is my grief or lesser than my name or that i could forget what i have been or not remember what i must be now swell'st thou proud heart i'll give thee scope to beat since foes have scope to beat both thee and me what must the king do now must he submit the king shall do it must he be deposed the king shall be contented must he lose the name of king i' god's name let it go i'll give my jewels for a set of beads my gorgeous palace for a hermitage my gay apparel for an almsman's gown my figured goblets for a dish of wood my scepter for a palmer's walking staff my subjects for a pair of carv\u00e8d saints and my large kingdom for a little grave a little little grave an obscure grave or i'll be buried in the king's highway some way of common trade where subjects' feet may hourly trample on their sovereign's head for on my heart they tread now whilst i live and buried once why not upon my head aumerle thou weep'st my tender hearted cousin we'll make foul weather with despis\u00e8d tears our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn and make a dearth in this revolting land or shall we play the wantons with our woes and make some pretty match with shedding tears as thus to drop them still upon one place till they have fretted us a pair of graves within the earth and therein laid there lies two kinsmen digged their graves with weeping eyes would not this ill do well well well i see i talk but idly and you laugh at me most mighty prince my lord northumberland what says king bolingbroke will his majesty give richard leave to live till richard die you make a leg and bolingbroke says ay down down i come like glist'ring pha\u00ebton wanting the manage of unruly jades in the base court base court where kings grow base to come at traitors' calls and do them grace in the base court come down down court down king for nightowls shriek where mounting larks should sing fair cousin you debase your princely knee to make the base earth proud with kissing it me rather had my heart might feel your love than my unpleased eye see your courtesy up cousin up your heart is up i know thus high at least although your knee be low your own is yours and i am yours and all well you deserve they well deserve to have that know the strong'st and surest way to get  uncle give me your hands nay dry your eyes tears show their love but want their remedies  cousin i am too young to be your father though you are old enough to be my heir what you will have i'll give and willing too for do we must what force will have us do set on towards london cousin is it so then i must not say no alack why am i sent for to a king before i have shook off the regal thoughts wherewith i reigned i hardly yet have learned to insinuate flatter bow and bend my knee give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me to this submission yet i well remember the favors of these men were they not mine did they not sometime cry all hail to me so judas did to christ but he in twelve found truth in all but one i in twelve thousand none god save the king will no man say amen am i both priest and clerk well then amen god save the king although i be not he and yet amen if heaven do think him me to do what service am i sent for hither give me the crown here cousin seize the crown here cousin on this side my hand on that side thine now is this golden crown like a deep well that owes two buckets filling one another the emptier ever dancing in the air the other down unseen and full of water that bucket down and full of tears am i drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high my crown i am but still my griefs are mine you may my glories and my state depose but not my griefs still am i king of those your cares set up do not pluck my cares down my care is loss of care by old care done your care is gain of care by new care won the cares i give i have though given away they 'tend the crown yet still with me they stay ay no no ay for i must nothing be therefore no no for i resign to thee now mark me how i will undo myself i give this heavy weight from off my head and this unwieldy scepter from my hand the pride of kingly sway from out my heart with mine own tears i wash away my balm with mine own hands i give away my crown with mine own tongue deny my sacred state with mine own breath release all duteous oaths all pomp and majesty i do forswear my manors rents revenues i forgo my acts decrees and statutes i deny god pardon all oaths that are broke to me god keep all vows unbroke are made to thee make me that nothing have with nothing grieved and thou with all pleased that hast all achieved long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit and soon lie richard in an earthy pit god save king henry unkinged richard says and send him many years of sunshine days what more remains must i do so and must i ravel out my weaved up follies gentle northumberland if thy offenses were upon record would it not shame thee in so fair a troop to read a lecture of them if thou wouldst there shouldst thou find one heinous article containing the deposing of a king and cracking the strong warrant of an oath marked with a blot damned in the book of heaven  nay all of you that stand and look upon me whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself though some of you with pilate wash your hands showing an outward pity yet you pilates have here delivered me to my sour cross and water cannot wash away your sin mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see and yet salt water blinds them not so much but they can see a sort of traitors here nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself i find myself a traitor with the rest for i have given here my soul's consent t' undeck the pompous body of a king made glory base and sovereignty a slave proud majesty a subject state a peasant no lord of thine thou haught insulting man nor no man's lord i have no name no title no not that name was given me at the font but 'tis usurped alack the heavy day that i have worn so many winters out and know not now what name to call myself o that i were a mockery king of snow standing before the sun of bolingbroke to melt myself away in water drops  good king great king and yet not greatly good an if my word be sterling yet in england let it command a mirror hither straight that it may show me what a face i have since it is bankrupt of his majesty fiend thou torments me ere i come to hell they shall be satisfied i'll read enough when i do see the very book indeed where all my sins are writ and that's myself give me that glass and therein will i read no deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck so many blows upon this face of mine and made no deeper wounds o flatt'ring glass like to my followers in prosperity thou dost beguile me was this face the face that every day under his household roof did keep ten thousand men was this the face that like the sun did make beholders wink is this the face which faced so many follies that was at last outfaced by bolingbroke a brittle glory shineth in this face as brittle as the glory is the face for there it is cracked in an hundred shivers  mark silent king the moral of this sport how soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face say that again the shadow of my sorrow ha let's see 'tis very true my grief lies all within and these external manners of laments are merely shadows to the unseen grief that swells with silence in the tortured soul there lies the substance and i thank thee king for thy great bounty that not only giv'st me cause to wail but teachest me the way how to lament the cause i'll beg one boon and then be gone and trouble you no more shall i obtain it fair cousin i am greater than a king for when i was a king my flatterers were then but subjects being now a subject i have a king here to my flatterer being so great i have no need to beg and shall i have then give me leave to go whither you will so i were from your sights o good convey conveyers are you all that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall join not with grief fair woman do not so to make my end too sudden learn good soul to think our former state a happy dream from which awaked the truth of what we are shows us but this i am sworn brother sweet to grim necessity and he and i will keep a league till death hie thee to france and cloister thee in some religious house our holy lives must win a new world's crown which our profane hours here have thrown down a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts i had been still a happy king of men good sometime queen prepare thee hence for france think i am dead and that even here thou takest as from my deathbed thy last living leave in winter's tedious nights sit by the fire with good old folks and let them tell thee tales of woeful ages long ago betid and ere thou bid good night to quite their griefs tell thou the lamentable tale of me and send the hearers weeping to their beds forwhy the senseless brands will sympathize the heavy accent of thy moving tongue and in compassion weep the fire out and some will mourn in ashes some coal black for the deposing of a rightful king northumberland thou ladder wherewithal the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne the time shall not be many hours of age more than it is ere foul sin gathering head shall break into corruption thou shalt think though he divide the realm and give thee half it is too little helping him to all he shall think that thou which knowest the way to plant unrightful kings wilt know again being ne'er so little urged another way to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne the love of wicked men converts to fear that fear to hate and hate turns one or both to worthy danger and deserv\u00e8d death doubly divorced bad men you violate a twofold marriage twixt my crown and me and then betwixt me and my married wife let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me and yet not so for with a kiss 'twas made  part us northumberland i towards the north where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime my wife to france from whence set forth in pomp she came adorn\u00e8d hither like sweet may sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart so two together weeping make one woe weep thou for me in france i for thee here better far off than near be ne'er the near go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans twice for one step i'll groan the way being short and piece the way out with a heavy heart come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief since wedding it there is such length in grief one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart we make woe wanton with this fond delay once more adieu the rest let sorrow say i have been studying how i may compare this prison where i live unto the world and for because the world is populous and here is not a creature but myself i cannot do it yet i'll hammer it out my brain i'll prove the female to my soul my soul the father and these two beget a generation of still breeding thoughts and these same thoughts people this little world in humors like the people of this world for no thought is contented the better sort as thoughts of things divine are intermixed with scruples and do set the word itself against the word as thus come little ones and then again it is as hard to come as for a camel to thread the postern of a small needle's eye thoughts tending to ambition they do plot unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails may tear a passage through the flinty ribs of this hard world my ragged prison walls and for they cannot die in their own pride thoughts tending to content flatter themselves that they are not the first of fortune's slaves nor shall not be the last like silly beggars who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame that many have and others must sit there and in this thought they find a kind of ease bearing their own misfortunes on the back of such as have before endured the like thus play i in one person many people and none contented sometimes am i king then treasons make me wish myself a beggar and so i am then crushing penury persuades me i was better when a king then am i kinged again and by and by think that i am unkinged by bolingbroke and straight am nothing but whate'er i be nor i nor any man that but man is with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased with being nothing music do i hear ha ha keep time how sour sweet music is when time is broke and no proportion kept so is it in the music of men's lives and here have i the daintiness of ear to check time broke in a disordered string but for the concord of my state and time had not an ear to hear my true time broke i wasted time and now doth time waste me for now hath time made me his numb'ring clock my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch whereto my finger like a dial's point is pointing still in cleansing them from tears now sir the sound that tells what hour it is are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans show minutes times and hours but my time runs posting on in bolingbroke's proud joy while i stand fooling here his jack of the clock this music mads me let it sound no more for though it have holp madmen to their wits in me it seems it will make wise men mad yet blessing on his heart that gives it me for 'tis a sign of love and love to richard is a strange brooch in this all hating world thanks noble peer the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear what art thou and how comest thou hither where no man never comes but that sad dog that brings me food to make misfortune live rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend how went he under him so proud that bolingbroke was on his back that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand this hand hath made him proud with clapping him would he not stumble would he not fall down since pride must have a fall and break the neck of that proud man that did usurp his back forgiveness horse why do i rail on thee since thou created to be awed by man wast born to bear i was not made a horse and yet i bear a burden like an ass spurred galled and tired by jauncing bolingbroke if thou love me 'tis time thou wert away taste of it first as thou art wont to do the devil take henry of lancaster and thee patience is stale and i am weary of it how now what means death in this rude assault villain thy own hand yields thy death's instrument go thou and fill another room in hell that hand shall burn in never quenching fire that staggers thus my person exton thy fierce hand hath with the king's blood stained the king's own land mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die", "R3_Buckingham": "good time of day unto your royal grace madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully ay madam he desires to make atonement between the duke of gloucester and your brothers and between them and my lord chamberlain and sent to warn them to his royal presence northumberland then present wept to see it peace peace for shame if not for charity have done have done nor no one here for curses never pass the lips of those that breathe them in the air nothing that i respect my gracious lord my hair doth stand an end to hear her curses whenever buckingham doth turn his hate upon your grace but with all duteous love doth cherish you and yours god punish me with hate in those where i expect most love when i have most need to employ a friend and most assur\u00e8d that he is a friend deep hollow treacherous and full of guile be he unto me this do i beg of god when i am cold in love to you or yours and in good time here comes sir richard ratcliffe and the duke look i so pale lord dorset as the rest we wait upon your grace you cloudy princes and heart sorrowing peers that bear this heavy mutual load of moan now cheer each other in each other's love though we have spent our harvest of this king we are to reap the harvest of his son the broken rancor of your high swoll'n hates but lately splintered knit and joined together must gently be preserved cherished and kept meseemeth good that with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fet hither to london to be crowned our king marry my lord lest by a multitude the new healed wound of malice should break out which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and yet ungoverned where every horse bears his commanding rein and may direct his course as please himself as well the fear of harm as harm apparent in my opinion ought to be prevented my lord whoever journeys to the prince for god's sake let not us two stay at home for by the way i'll sort occasion as index to the story we late talked of to part the queen's proud kindred from the prince welcome sweet prince to london to your chamber and in good time here comes the sweating lord fie what an indirect and peevish course is this of hers lord cardinal will your grace persuade the queen to send the duke of york unto his princely brother presently  if she deny lord hastings go with him and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce you are too senseless obstinate my lord too ceremonious and traditional weigh it but with the grossness of this age you break not sanctuary in seizing him the benefit thereof is always granted to those whose dealings have deserved the place and those who have the wit to claim the place this prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it then taking him from thence that is not there you break no privilege nor charter there oft have i heard of sanctuary men but sanctuary children never till now he did my gracious lord begin that place which since succeeding ages have re edified upon record my gracious lord what my gracious lord now in good time here comes the duke of york with what a sharp provided wit he reasons to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle he prettily and aptly taunts himself so cunning and so young is wonderful think you my lord this little prating york was not incens\u00e8d by his subtle mother to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously well let them rest come hither catesby thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend as closely to conceal what we impart thou knowest our reasons urged upon the way what thinkest thou is it not an easy matter to make william lord hastings of our mind for the installment of this noble duke in the seat royal of this famous isle what think'st thou then of stanley will not he well then no more but this go gentle catesby and as it were far off sound thou lord hastings how he doth stand affected to our purpose and summon him tomorrow to the tower to sit about the coronation if thou dost find him tractable to us encourage him and tell him all our reasons if he be leaden icy cold unwilling be thou so too and so break off the talk and give us notice of his inclination for we tomorrow hold divided councils wherein thyself shalt highly be employed good catesby go effect this business soundly now my lord what shall we do if we perceive lord hastings will not yield to our complots i'll claim that promise at your grace's hand what talking with a priest lord chamberlain your friends at pomfret they do need the priest your honor hath no shriving work in hand i do my lord but long i cannot stay there i shall return before your lordship thence and supper too although thou know'st it not  come will you go is all things ready for the royal time who knows the lord protector's mind herein who is most inward with the noble duke we know each other's faces for our hearts he knows no more of mine than i of yours or i of his my lord than you of mine  lord hastings you and he are near in love had you not come upon your cue my lord william lord hastings had pronounced your part  i mean your voice for crowning of the king withdraw yourself awhile i'll go with you tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian speak and look back and pry on every side tremble and start at wagging of a straw intending deep suspicion ghastly looks are at my service like enforc\u00e8d smiles and both are ready in their offices at any time to grace my stratagems but what is catesby gone lord mayor  hark a drum lord mayor the reason we have sent  god and our innocence defend and guard us well well he was the covert'st sheltered traitor that ever lived  would you imagine or almost believe were 't not that by great preservation we live to tell it that the subtle traitor this day had plotted in the council house to murder me and my good lord of gloucester i never looked for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore yet had we not determined he should die until your lordship came to see his end which now the loving haste of these our friends something against our meanings have prevented because my lord i would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treasons that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens who haply may misconster us in him and wail his death which since you come too late of our intent yet witness what you hear we did intend and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell doubt not my lord i'll play the orator as if the golden fee for which i plead were for myself and so my lord adieu i go and towards three or four o'clock look for the news that the guildhall affords now by the holy mother of our lord the citizens are mum say not a word i did with his contract with lady lucy and his contract by deputy in france th' unsatiate greediness of his desire and his enforcement of the city wives his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy as being got your father then in france and his resemblance being not like the duke withal i did infer your lineaments being the right idea of your father both in your form and nobleness of mind laid open all your victories in scotland your discipline in war wisdom in peace your bounty virtue fair humility indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose untouched or slightly handled in discourse and when mine oratory drew toward end i bid them that did love their country's good cry god save richard england's royal king no so god help me they spake not a word but like dumb statues or breathing stones stared each on other and looked deadly pale which when i saw i reprehended them and asked the mayor what meant this willful silence his answer was the people were not used to be spoke to but by the recorder then he was urged to tell my tale again thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferred  but nothing spoke in warrant from himself when he had done some followers of mine own at lower end of the hall hurled up their caps and some ten voices cried god save king richard and thus i took the vantage of those few thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i this general applause and cheerful shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard  and even here brake off and came away the mayor is here at hand intend some fear be not you spoke with but by mighty suit and look you get a prayer book in your hand and stand between two churchmen good my lord for on that ground i'll make a holy descant and be not easily won to our requests play the maid's part still answer nay and take it go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks welcome my lord i dance attendance here i think the duke will not be spoke withal now catesby what says your lord to my request return good catesby to the gracious duke tell him myself the mayor and aldermen in deep designs in matter of great moment no less importing than our general good are come to have some conference with his grace ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward he is not lolling on a lewd love bed but on his knees at meditation not dallying with a brace of courtesans but meditating with two deep divines not sleeping to engross his idle body but praying to enrich his watchful soul happy were england would this virtuous prince take on his grace the sovereignty thereof but sure i fear we shall not win him to it i fear he will here catesby comes again now catesby what says his grace sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him by heaven we come to him in perfect love and so once more return and tell his grace when holy and devout religious men are at their beads 'tis much to draw them thence so sweet is zealous contemplation two props of virtue for a christian prince to stay him from the fall of vanity and see a book of prayer in his hand true ornaments to know a holy man  famous plantagenet most gracious prince lend favorable ear to our requests and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal even that i hope which pleaseth god above and all good men of this ungoverned isle you have my lord would it might please your grace on our entreaties to amend your fault know then it is your fault that you resign the supreme seat the throne majestical the sceptered office of your ancestors your state of fortune and your due of birth the lineal glory of your royal house to the corruption of a blemished stock whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts which here we waken to our country's good the noble isle doth want her proper limbs  her face defaced with scars of infamy her royal stock graft with ignoble plants and almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion which to recure we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land not as protector steward substitute or lowly factor for another's gain but as successively from blood to blood your right of birth your empery your own for this consorted with the citizens your very worshipful and loving friends and by their vehement instigation in this just cause come i to move your grace my lord this argues conscience in your grace but the respects thereof are nice and trivial all circumstances well consider\u00e8d you say that edward is your brother's son so say we too but not by edward's wife for first was he contract to lady lucy  your mother lives a witness to his vow  and afterward by substitute betrothed to bona sister to the king of france these both put off a poor petitioner a care crazed mother to a many sons a beauty waning and distress\u00e8d widow even in the afternoon of her best days made prize and purchase of his wanton eye seduced the pitch and height of his degree to base declension and loathed bigamy by her in his unlawful bed he got this edward whom our manners call the prince more bitterly could i expostulate save that for reverence to some alive i give a sparing limit to my tongue then good my lord take to your royal self this proffered benefit of dignity if not to bless us and the land withal yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal true deriv\u00e8d course refuse not mighty lord this proffered love if you refuse it as in love and zeal loath to depose the child your brother's son  as well we know your tenderness of heart and gentle kind effeminate remorse which we have noted in you to your kindred and equally indeed to all estates  yet know whe'er you accept our suit or no your brother's son shall never reign our king but we will plant some other in the throne to the disgrace and downfall of your house and in this resolution here we leave you  come citizens zounds i'll entreat no more then i salute you with this royal title long live richard england's worthy king tomorrow may it please you to be crowned tomorrow then we will attend your grace and so most joyfully we take our leave my gracious sovereign still live they and forever let them last say on my loving lord why so you are my thrice renown\u00e8d lord true noble prince your grace may do your pleasure give me some little breath some pause dear lord before i positively speak in this i will resolve you herein presently my lord i have considered in my mind the late request that you did sound me in i hear the news my lord my lord i claim the gift my due by promise for which your honor and your faith is pawned  th' earldom of hereford and the movables which you have promis\u00e8d i shall possess what says your highness to my just request my lord  my lord your promise for the earldom  my lord  i am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promised me upon the stroke of ten why let it strike why then resolve me whether you will or no and is it thus repays he my deep service with such contempt made i him king for this o let me think on hastings and be gone to brecknock while my fearful head is on will not king richard let me speak with him hastings and edward's children grey and rivers holy king henry and thy fair son edward vaughan and all that have miscarri\u00e8d by underhand corrupted foul injustice if that your moody discontented souls do through the clouds behold this present hour even for revenge mock my destruction  this is all souls' day fellow is it not why then all souls' day is my body's doomsday this is the day which in king edward's time i wished might fall on me when i was found false to his children and his wife's allies this is the day wherein i wished to fall by the false faith of him whom most i trusted this this all souls' day to my fearful soul is the determined respite of my wrongs that high all seer which i dallied with hath turned my feign\u00e8d prayer on my head and given in earnest what i begged in jest thus doth he force the swords of wicked men to turn their own points in their masters' bosoms thus margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck when he quoth she shall split thy heart with sorrow remember margaret was a prophetess  come lead me officers to the block of shame wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame the first was i that helped thee to the crown the last was i that felt thy tyranny o in the battle think on buckingham and die in terror of thy guiltiness dream on dream on of bloody deeds and death fainting despair despairing yield thy breath i died for hope ere i could lend thee aid but cheer thy heart and be thou not dismayed god and good angels fight on richmond's side and richard fall in height of all his pride", "LLL_Berowne": "i can but say their protestation over so much dear liege i have already sworn that is to live and study here three years but there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term which i hope well is not enroll\u00e8d there and one day in a week to touch no food and but one meal on every day besides the which i hope is not enroll\u00e8d there and then to sleep but three hours in the night and not be seen to wink of all the day  when i was wont to think no harm all night and make a dark night too of half the day  which i hope well is not enroll\u00e8d there o these are barren tasks too hard to keep not to see ladies study fast not sleep let me say no my liege an if you please i only swore to study with your grace and stay here in your court for three years' space by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest what is the end of study let me know things hid and barred you mean from common sense come on then i will swear to study so to know the thing i am forbid to know as thus to study where i well may dine when i to feast expressly am forbid or study where to meet some mistress fine when mistresses from common sense are hid or having sworn too hard a keeping oath study to break it and not break my troth if study's gain be thus and this be so study knows that which yet it doth not know swear me to this and i will ne'er say no why all delights are vain and that most vain which with pain purchased doth inherit pain as painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth while truth the while doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look light seeking light doth light of light beguile so ere you find where light in darkness lies your light grows dark by losing of your eyes study me how to please the eye indeed by fixing it upon a fairer eye who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed and give him light that it was blinded by study is like the heaven's glorious sun that will not be deep searched with saucy looks small have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others' books these earthly godfathers of heaven's lights that give a name to every fix\u00e8d star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and wot not what they are too much to know is to know naught but fame and every godfather can give a name the spring is near when green geese are a breeding fit in his place and time something then in rhyme well say i am why should proud summer boast before the birds have any cause to sing why should i joy in any abortive birth at christmas i no more desire a rose than wish a snow in may's new fangled shows but like of each thing that in season grows so you to study now it is too late climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you and though i have for barbarism spoke more than for that angel knowledge you can say yet confident i'll keep what i have sworn and bide the penance of each three years' day give me the paper let me read the same and to the strictest decrees i'll write my name item that no woman shall come within a mile of my court hath this been proclaimed let's see the penalty on pain of losing her tongue who devised this penalty sweet lord and why a dangerous law against gentility item if any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possible devise this article my liege yourself must break for well you know here comes in embassy the french king's daughter with yourself to speak  a maid of grace and complete majesty  about surrender up of aquitaine to her decrepit sick and bedrid father therefore this article is made in vain or vainly comes th' admir\u00e8d princess hither so study evermore is overshot while it doth study to have what it would it doth forget to do the thing it should and when it hath the thing it hunteth most 'tis won as towns with fire so won so lost necessity will make us all forsworn three thousand times within this three years' space for every man with his affects is born not by might mastered but by special grace if i break faith this word shall speak for me i am forsworn on mere necessity so to the laws at large i write my name and he that breaks them in the least degree stands in attainder of eternal shame suggestions are to other as to me but i believe although i seem so loath i am the last that will last keep his oath but is there no quick recreation granted armado is a most illustrious wight a man of fire new words fashion's own knight

as flesh and blood can be the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face young blood doth not obey an old decree we cannot cross the cause why we were born therefore of all hands must we be forsworn did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline that like a rude and savage man of ind at the first op'ning of the gorgeous east bows not his vassal head and strucken blind kisses the base ground with obedient breast what peremptory eagle sighted eye dares look upon the heaven of her brow that is not blinded by her majesty my eyes are then no eyes nor i berowne o but for my love day would turn to night of all complexions the culled sovereignty do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek where several worthies make one dignity where nothing wants that want itself doth seek lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues  fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not to things of sale a seller's praise belongs she passes praise then praise too short doth blot a withered hermit fivescore winters worn might shake off fifty looking in her eye beauty doth varnish age as if newborn and gives the crutch the cradle's infancy o 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine is ebony like her o word divine a wife of such wood were felicity o who can give an oath where is a book that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack if that she learn not of her eye to look no face is fair that is not full so black devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light o if in black my lady's brows be decked it mourns that painting and usurping hair should ravish doters with a false aspect and therefore is she born to make black fair her favor turns the fashion of the days for native blood is counted painting now and therefore red that would avoid dispraise paints itself black to imitate her brow your mistresses dare never come in rain for fear their colors should be washed away i'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here o if the streets were pav\u00e8d with thine eyes her feet were much too dainty for such tread nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn o 'tis more than need have at you then affection's men at arms o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beauty's tutors have enriched you with other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practicers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learn\u00e8d in a lady's eyes lives not alone immur\u00e8d in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind a lover's ear will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stopped love's feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockled snails love's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste for valor is not love a hercules still climbing trees in the hesperides subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical as bright apollo's lute strung with his hair and when love speaks the voice of all the gods make heaven drowsy with the harmony never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were tempered with love's sighs o then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility from women's eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in ought proves excellent then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools for wisdom's sake a word that all men love or for love's sake a word that loves all men or for men's sake the authors of these women or women's sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths it is religion to be thus forsworn for charity itself fulfills the law and who can sever love from charity advance your standards and upon them lords pell mell down with them but be first advised in conflict that you get the sun of them first from the park let us conduct them thither then homeward every man attach the hand of his fair mistress in the afternoon we will with some strange pastime solace them such as the shortness of the time can shape for revels dances masques and merry hours forerun fair love strewing her way with flowers allons allons sowed cockle reaped no corn and justice

such show this gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve had he been adam he had tempted eve he can carve too and lisp why this is he that kissed his hand away in courtesy this is the ape of form

habit wait o never will i trust to speeches penned nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue nor never come in vizard to my friend nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper's song taffeta phrases silken terms precise three piled hyperboles spruce affectation figures pedantical these summer flies have blown me full of maggot ostentation i do forswear them and i here protest by this white glove how white the hand god knows  henceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed in russet yeas and honest kersey noes and to begin wench so god help me law my love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw yet i have a trick of the old rage bear with me i am sick i'll leave it by degrees soft let us see write lord have mercy on us on those three they are infected in their hearts it lies they have the plague

entice his own to evil should be done by none but custom what they did begin was with long use accounted no sin the beauty of this sinful dame made many princes thither frame to seek her as a

the loss of maidenhead a babe is molded be attent and time that is so briefly spent with your fine fancies quaintly eche what's dumb in show i'll plain with speech by many a dern and painful perch of pericles the careful search by the four opposing coigns which the world together joins is made with all due diligence that horse and sail and high expense can stead the quest at last from tyre fame answering the most strange enquire to th' court of king simonides are letters brought the tenor these antiochus and his daughter dead the men of tyrus on the head of helicanus would set on the crown of tyre but he will none the mutiny he there hastes t' oppress says to 'em if king pericles come not home in twice six moons he obedient to their dooms will take the crown the sum of this brought hither to pentapolis y ravish\u00e8d the regions round and everyone with claps can sound our heir apparent is a king who dreamt who thought of such a thing brief he must hence depart to tyre his queen with child makes her desire  which who shall cross along to go omit we all their dole and woe lychorida her nurse she takes and so to sea their vessel shakes on neptune's billow half the flood hath their keel cut but fortune moved varies again the grizzled north disgorges such a tempest forth that as a duck for life that dives so up and down the poor ship drives the lady shrieks and well anear does fall in travail with her fear and what ensues in this fell storm shall for itself itself perform i nill relate action may conveniently the rest convey which might not what by me is told in your imagination hold this stage the ship upon whose deck the sea tossed pericles appears to speak imagine pericles arrived at tyre welcomed and settled to his own desire his woeful queen we leave at ephesus unto diana there 's a votaress now to marina bend your mind whom our fast growing scene must find at tarsus and by cleon trained in music letters who hath gained of education all the grace which makes high both the art and place of general wonder but alack that monster envy oft the wrack of earn\u00e8d praise marina's life seeks to take off by treason's knife and in this kind our cleon hath one daughter and a full grown wench even ripe for marriage rite this maid hight philoten and it is said for certain in our story she would ever with marina be be 't when they weaved the sleided silk with fingers long small white as milk or when she would with sharp needle wound the cambric which she made more sound by hurting it or when to the lute she sung and made the night bird mute that still records with moan or when she would with rich and constant pen vail to her mistress dian still this philoten contends in skill with absolute marina so with the dove of paphos might the crow vie feathers white marina gets all praises which are paid as debts and not as given this so darks in philoten all graceful marks that cleon's wife with envy rare a present murderer does prepare for good marina that her daughter might stand peerless by this slaughter the sooner her vile thoughts to stead lychorida our nurse is dead and curs\u00e8d dionyza hath the pregnant instrument of wrath prest for this blow the unborn event i do commend to your content only i carry wing\u00e8d time post on the lame feet of my rhyme which never could i so convey unless your thoughts went on my way dionyza does appear with leonine a murderer thus time we waste and long leagues make short sail seas in cockles have and wish but for 't making to take our imagination from bourn to bourn region to region by you being pardoned we commit no crime to use one language in each several clime where our scenes seems to live i do beseech you to learn of me who stand in the gaps to teach you the stages of our story pericles is now again thwarting the wayward seas attended on by many a lord and knight to see his daughter all his life's delight old helicanus goes along behind is left to govern it you bear in mind old escanes whom helicanus late advanced in time to great and high estate well sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought this king to tarsus think his pilot thought so with his steerage shall your thoughts go on  to fetch his daughter home who first is gone like motes and shadows see them move awhile your ears unto your eyes i'll reconcile see how belief may suffer by foul show this borrowed passion stands for true old woe and pericles in sorrow all devoured with sighs shot through and biggest tears o'ershowered leaves tarsus and again embarks he swears never to wash his face nor cut his hairs he puts on sackcloth and to sea he bears a tempest which his mortal vessel tears and yet he rides it out now please you wit the epitaph is for marina writ by wicked dionyza the fairest sweetest and best lies here who withered in her spring of year she was of tyrus the king's daughter on whom foul death hath made this slaughter marina was she called and at her birth thetis being proud swallowed some part o' th' earth therefore the earth fearing to be o'erflowed hath thetis' birth child on the heavens bestowed wherefore she does and swears she'll never stint  make raging battery upon shores of flint no visor does become black villainy so well as soft and tender flattery let pericles believe his daughter's dead and bear his courses to be order\u00e8d by lady fortune while our scene must play his daughter's woe and heavy welladay in her unholy service patience then and think you now are all in mytilene marina thus the brothel 'scapes and chances into an honest house our story says she sings like one immortal and she dances as goddesslike to her admir\u00e8d lays deep clerks she dumbs and with her neele composes nature's own shape of bud bird branch or berry that even her art sisters the natural roses her inkle silk twin with the rubied cherry that pupils lacks she none of noble race who pour their bounty on her and her gain she gives the curs\u00e8d bawd here we her place and to her father turn our thoughts again where we left him on the sea we there him lost where driven before the winds he is arrived here where his daughter dwells and on this coast suppose him now at anchor the city strived god neptune's annual feast to keep from whence lysimachus our tyrian ship espies his banners sable trimmed with rich expense and to him in his barge with fervor hies in your supposing once more put your sight of heavy pericles think this his bark where what is done in action more if might  shall be discovered please you sit and hark now our sands are almost run more a little and then dumb this my last boon give me  for such kindness must relieve me  that you aptly will suppose what pageantry what feats what shows what minstrelsy and pretty din the regent made in mytilene to greet the king so he thrived that he is promised to be wived to fair marina but in no wise till he had done his sacrifice as dian bade whereto being bound the interim pray you all confound in feathered briefness sails are filled and wishes fall out as they're willed at ephesus the temple see our king and all his company that he can hither come so soon is by your fancies' thankful doom in antiochus and his daughter you have heard of monstrous lust the due and just reward in pericles his queen and daughter seen although assailed with fortune fierce and keen virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast led on by heaven and crowned with joy at last in helicanus may you well descry a figure of truth of faith of loyalty in reverend cerimon there well appears the worth that learn\u00e8d charity aye wears for wicked cleon and his wife when fame had spread his curs\u00e8d deed to the honored name of pericles to rage the city turn that him and his

when the fight was done when i was dry with rage and extreme toil breathless and faint leaning upon my sword came there a certain lord neat and trimly dressed fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reaped showed like a stubble land at harvest home he was perfum\u00e8d like a milliner and 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held a pouncet box which ever and anon he gave his nose and took 't away again who therewith angry when it next came there took it in snuff and still he smiled and talked and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by he called them untaught knaves unmannerly to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility with many holiday and lady terms he questioned me amongst the rest demanded my prisoners in your majesty's behalf i then all smarting with my wounds being cold to be so pestered with a popinjay out of my grief and my impatience answered neglectingly i know not what  he should or he should not for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a waiting gentlewoman of guns and drums and wounds god save the mark  and telling me the sovereignest thing on earth was parmacety for an inward bruise and that it was great pity so it was this villainous saltpeter should be digged out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroyed so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier this bald unjointed chat of his my lord i answered indirectly as i said and i beseech you let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty revolted mortimer he never did fall off my sovereign liege but by the chance of war to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds those mouth\u00e8d wounds which valiantly he took when on the gentle severn's sedgy bank in single opposition hand to hand he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severn's flood who then affrighted with their bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank blood stain\u00e8d with these valiant combatants never did bare and rotten policy color her working with such deadly wounds nor never could the noble mortimer receive so many and all willingly then let not him be slandered with revolt an if the devil come and roar for them i will not send them i will after straight and tell him so for i will ease my heart albeit i make a hazard of my head speak of mortimer zounds i will speak of him and let my soul want mercy if i do not join with him yea on his part i'll empty all these veins and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust but i will lift the downtrod mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king as this ingrate and cankered bolingbroke he will forsooth have all my prisoners and when i urged the ransom once again of my wife's brother then his cheek looked pale and on my face he turned an eye of death trembling even at the name of mortimer but soft i pray you did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown nay then i cannot blame his cousin king that wished him on the barren mountains starve but shall it be that you that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornation shall it be that you a world of curses undergo being the agents or base second means the cords the ladder or the hangman rather o pardon me that i descend so low to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtle king shall it for shame be spoken in these days or fill up chronicles in time to come that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf as both of you god pardon it have done to put down richard that sweet lovely rose and plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke and shall it in more shame be further spoken that you are fooled discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames you underwent no yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banished honors and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again revenge the jeering and disdained contempt of this proud king who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore i say  if he fall in good night or sink or swim send danger from the east unto the west so honor cross it from the north to south and let them grapple o the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honor from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line could never touch the ground and pluck up drown\u00e8d honor by the locks so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival all her dignities but out upon this half faced fellowship i cry you mercy i'll keep them all by god he shall not have a scot of them no if a scot would save his soul he shall not i'll keep them by this hand nay i will that's flat he said he would not ransom mortimer forbade my tongue to speak of mortimer but i will find him when he lies asleep and in his ear i'll hollo mortimer nay i'll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but mortimer and give it him to keep his anger still in motion all studies here i solemnly defy save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same sword and buckler prince of wales  but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance  i would have him poisoned with a pot of ale why look you i am whipped and scourged with rods nettled and stung with pismires when i hear of this vile politician bolingbroke in richard's time what do you call the place a plague upon it it is in gloucestershire 'twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept his uncle york where i first bowed my knee unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke 'sblood when you and he came back from ravenspurgh you say true why what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me look when his infant fortune came to age and gentle harry percy and kind cousin o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me good uncle tell your tale i have done i have done i' faith of york is it not i smell it upon my life it will do well why it cannot choose but be a noble plot and then the power of scotland and of york to join with mortimer ha in faith it is exceedingly well aimed he does he does we'll be revenged on him uncle adieu o let the hours be short till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport but for mine own part my lord i could be well contented to be there in respect of the love i bear your house he could be contented why is he not then in respect of the love he bears our house he shows in this he loves his own barn better than he loves our house let me see some more the purpose you undertake is dangerous why that's certain 'tis dangerous to take a cold to sleep to drink but i tell you my lord fool out of this nettle danger we pluck this flower safety the purpose you undertake is dangerous the friends you have named uncertain the time itself unsorted and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition say you so say you so i say unto you again you are a shallow cowardly hind and you lie what a lack brain is this by the lord our plot is a good plot as ever was laid our friends true and constant a good plot good friends and full of expectation an excellent plot very good friends what a frosty spirited rogue is this why my lord of york commends the plot and the general course of the action zounds an i were now by this rascal i could brain him with his lady's fan is there not my father my uncle and myself lord edmund mortimer my lord of york and owen glendower is there not besides the douglas have i not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month and are they not some of them set forward already what a pagan rascal is this an infidel ha you shall see now in very sincerity of fear and cold heart will he to the king and lay open all our proceedings o i could divide myself and go to buffets for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honorable an action hang him let him tell the king we are prepared i will set forward tonight how now kate i must leave you within these two hours what ho is gilliams with the packet gone hath butler brought those horses from the sheriff what horse a roan a crop ear is it not that roan shall be my

whither i go nor reason whereabout whither i must i must and to conclude this evening must i leave you gentle kate i know you wise but yet no farther wise than harry percy's wife constant you are but

thither shall you go too today will i set forth tomorrow you will this content you kate lord mortimer and cousin glendower will you sit down and uncle worcester  a plague upon it i have forgot the map and you in hell as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of why so it would have done at the same season if your mother's cat had but kittened though yourself had never been born and i say the earth was not of my mind if you suppose as fearing you it shook o then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire and not in fear of your nativity diseas\u00e8d nature oftentimes breaks forth in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth is with a kind of colic pinched and vexed by the imprisoning of unruly wind within her womb which for enlargement striving shakes the old beldam earth and topples down steeples and moss grown towers at your birth our grandam earth having this distemp'rature in passion shook i think there's no man speaks better welsh i'll to dinner why so can i or so can any man but will they come when you do call for them and i can teach thee coz to shame the devil by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil if thou have power to raise him bring him hither and i'll be sworn i have power to shame him hence o while you live tell truth and shame the devil home without boots and in foul weather too how 'scapes he agues in the devil's name methinks my moiety north from burton here in quantity equals not one of yours see how this river comes me cranking in and cuts me from the best of all my land a huge half moon a monstrous cantle out i'll have the current in this place dammed up and here the smug and silver trent shall run in a new channel fair and evenly it shall not wind with such a deep indent to rob me of so rich a bottom here i'll have it so a little charge will do it will not you who shall say me nay let me not understand you then speak it in welsh marry and i am glad of it with all my heart i had rather be a kitten and cry mew than one of these same meter balladmongers i had rather hear a brazen can'stick turned or a dry wheel grate on the axletree and that would set my teeth nothing an edge nothing so much as mincing poetry 'tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag i do not care i'll give thrice so much land to any well deserving friend but in the way of bargain mark you me i'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair are the indentures drawn shall we be gone i cannot choose sometime he angers me with telling me of the moldwarp and the ant of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies and of a dragon and a finless fish a clip winged griffin and a moulten raven a couching lion and a ramping cat and such a deal of skimble skamble stuff as puts me from my faith i tell you what  he held me last night at least nine hours in reckoning up the several devils' names that were his lackeys i cried hum and well go to but marked him not a word o he is as tedious as a tired horse a railing wife worse than a smoky house i had rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill far than feed on cates and have him talk to me in any summer house in christendom well i am schooled good manners be your speed here come our wives and let us take our leave come kate thou art perfect in lying down come quick quick that i may lay my head in thy lap now i perceive the devil understands welsh and 'tis no marvel he is so humorous by 'r lady he is a good musician i had rather hear lady my brach howl in irish no neither 'tis a woman's fault to the welsh lady's bed peace she sings come kate i'll have your song too not yours in good sooth heart you swear like a comfit maker's wife not you in good sooth and as true as i live and as god shall mend me and as sure as day  and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths as if thou never walk'st further than finsbury swear me kate like a lady as thou art a good mouth filling oath and leave in sooth and such protest of pepper gingerbread to velvet guards and sunday citizens come sing 'tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast teacher an the indentures be drawn i'll away within these two hours and so come in when you will well said my noble scot if speaking truth in this fine age were not thought flattery such attribution should the douglas have as not a soldier of this season's stamp should go so general current through the world by god i cannot flatter i do defy the tongues of soothers but a braver place in my heart's love hath no man than yourself nay task me to my word approve me lord do so and 'tis well what letters hast thou there i can but thank you letters from him why comes he not himself zounds how has he the leisure to be sick in such a justling time who leads his power under whose government come they along sick now droop now this sickness doth infect the very lifeblood of our enterprise 'tis catching hither even to our camp he writes me here that inward sickness  and that his friends by deputation could not so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet to lay so dangerous and dear a trust on any soul removed but on his own yet doth he give us bold advertisement that with our small conjunction we should on to see how fortune is disposed to us for as he writes there is no quailing now because the king is certainly possessed of all our purposes what say you to it a perilous gash a very limb lopped off and yet in faith it is not his present want seems more than we shall find it were it good to set the exact wealth of all our states all at one cast to set so rich a main on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour it were not good for therein should we read the very bottom and the soul of hope the very list the very utmost bound of all our fortunes a rendezvous a home to fly unto if that the devil and mischance look big upon the maidenhead of our affairs you strain too far i rather of his absence make this use it lends a luster and more great opinion a larger dare to our great enterprise than if the earl were here for men must think if we without his help can make a head to push against a kingdom with his help we shall o'erturn it topsy turvy down yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole my cousin vernon welcome by my soul no harm what more he shall be welcome too where is his son the nimble footed madcap prince of wales and his comrades that daffed the world aside and bid it pass no more no more worse than the sun in march this praise doth nourish agues let them come they come like sacrifices in their trim and to the fire eyed maid of smoky war all hot and bleeding will we offer them the mail\u00e8d mars shall on his altar sit up to the ears in blood i am on fire to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh and yet not ours come let me taste my horse who is to bear me like a thunderbolt against the bosom of the prince of wales harry to harry shall hot horse to horse meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse o that glendower were come what may the king's whole battle reach unto forty let it be my father and glendower being both away the powers of us may serve so great a day come let us take a muster speedily doomsday is near die all die merrily we'll fight with him tonight why say you so looks he not for supply his is certain ours is doubtful tonight say i so are the horses of the enemy in general journey bated and brought low the better part of ours are full of rest welcome sir walter blunt and would to god you were of our determination some of us love you well and even those some envy your great deservings and good name because you are not of our quality but stand against us like an enemy the king is kind and well we know the king knows at what time to promise when to pay my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears and when he was not six and twenty strong sick in the world's regard wretched and low a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home my father gave him welcome to the shore and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster to sue his livery and beg his peace with tears of innocency and terms of zeal my father in kind heart and pity moved swore him assistance and performed it too now when the lords and barons of the realm perceived northumberland did lean to him the more and less came in with cap and knee met him in boroughs cities villages attended him on bridges stood in lanes laid gifts before him proffered him their oaths gave him their heirs as pages followed him even at the heels in golden multitudes he presently as greatness knows itself steps me a little higher than his vow made to my father while his blood was poor upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh and now forsooth takes on him to reform some certain edicts and some strait decrees that lie too heavy on the commonwealth cries out upon abuses seems to weep over his country's wrongs and by this face this seeming brow of justice did he win the hearts of all that he did angle for proceeded further cut me off the heads of all the favorites that the absent king in deputation left behind him here when he was personal in the irish war then to the point in short time after he deposed the king soon after that deprived him of his life and in the neck of that tasked the whole state to make that worse suffered his kinsman march who is if every owner were well placed indeed his king to be engaged in wales there without ransom to lie forfeited disgraced me in my happy victories sought to entrap me by intelligence rated mine uncle from the council board in rage dismissed my father from the court broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong and in conclusion drove us to seek out this head of safety and withal to pry into his title the which we find too indirect for long continuance not so sir walter we'll withdraw awhile go to the king and let there be impawned some surety for a safe return again and in the morning early shall mine uncle bring him our purposes and so farewell and maybe so we shall my uncle is returned deliver up my lord of westmoreland  uncle what news lord douglas go you and tell him so did you beg any god forbid o would the quarrel lay upon our heads and that no man might draw short breath today but i and harry monmouth tell me tell me how showed his tasking seemed it in contempt cousin i think thou art enamor\u00e8d on his follies never did i hear of any prince so wild a liberty but be he as he will yet once ere night i will embrace him with a soldier's arm that he shall shrink under my courtesy  arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends better consider what you have to do than i that have not well the gift of tongue can lift your blood up with persuasion i cannot read them now  o gentlemen the time of life is short to spend that shortness basely were too long if life did ride upon a dial's point still ending at the arrival of an hour an if we live we live to tread on kings if die brave death when princes die with us now for our consciences the arms are fair when the intent of bearing them is just i thank him that he cuts me from my tale for i profess not talking only this let each man do his best and here draw i a sword whose temper i intend to stain with the best blood that i can meet withal in the adventure of this perilous day now esperance percy and set on sound all the lofty instruments of war and by that music let us all embrace for heaven to earth some of us never shall a second time do such a courtesy o douglas hadst thou fought at holmedon thus i never had triumphed upon a scot where this douglas no i know this face full well a gallant knight he was his name was blunt semblably furnished like the king himself the king hath many marching in his coats up and away our soldiers stand full fairly for the day if i mistake not thou art harry monmouth my name is harry percy nor shall it harry for the hour is come to end the one of us and would to god thy name in arms were now as great as mine i can no longer brook thy vanities o harry thou hast robbed me of my youth i better brook the loss of brittle life than those proud titles thou hast won of me they wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh but thoughts the slaves of life and life time's fool and time that takes survey of all the world must have a stop o i could prophesy but that the earthy and cold hand of death lies on my tongue no percy thou art dust and food for", "Tro_Aeneas":

parley we will talk with him the princely charles of france thy countryman brave burgundy undoubted hope of france stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee look on thy country look on fertile france and see the cities and the towns defaced by wasting ruin of the cruel foe as looks the mother on her lowly babe when death doth close his tender dying eyes see see the pining malady of france behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast o turn thy edg\u00e8d sword another way strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help one drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore return thee therefore with a flood of tears and wash away thy country's stain\u00e8d spots besides all french and france exclaims on thee doubting thy birth and lawful progeny who join'st thou with but with a lordly nation that will not trust thee but for profit's sake when talbot hath set footing once in france and

encountered him and thus i said thou maiden youth be vanquished by a maid but with a proud majestical high scorn he answered thus young talbot was not born to be the pillage of a giglot wench so rushing in the bowels of the french he left me proudly as unworthy fight here's a silly stately style indeed the turk that two and fifty kingdoms hath writes not so tedious a style as this him that thou magnifi'st with all these titles stinking and flyblown lies here at our feet i think this upstart is old talbot's ghost he speaks with such a proud commanding spirit for god's sake let him have him to keep them here they would but stink and putrefy the air peace be amongst them if they turn to us else ruin combat with their palaces of all base passions fear is most accursed command the

from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time my lungs began to crow like chanticleer that fools should be so deep contemplative and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial o noble fool a worthy fool motley's the only wear o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier and says if ladies be but young and fair they have the gift to know it and in his brain which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage he hath strange places crammed with observation the which he vents in mangled forms o that i were a fool i am

the infant mewling and puking in the nurse's arms then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress' eyebrow then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honor sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon's mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lined with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slippered pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well saved a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything i

proud of 'em and they have all the world in their chamber by my troth i think fame but stammers 'em they stand a grise above the reach of report nay most likely for they are noble suff'rers i marvel how they would have looked had they been victors that with such a constant nobility enforce a freedom out of bondage making misery their mirth and affliction a toy to jest at it seems to me they have no more sense of their captivity than i of ruling athens they eat well look merrily discourse of many things but nothing of their own restraint and disasters yet sometimes a divided sigh martyred as 'twere i' th' deliverance will break from one of them when the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that i could wish myself a sigh to be so chid or at least a sigher to be comforted no sir no that's palamon arcite is the lower of the twain you may perceive a part of him it is a holiday to look on them lord the diff'rence of men why should i love this gentleman 'tis odds he never will affect me i am base my father the mean keeper of his prison and he a prince to marry him is hopeless to be his whore is witless out upon 't what pushes are we wenches driven to when fifteen once has found us first i saw him i seeing thought he was a goodly man he has as much to please a woman in him if he please to bestow it so as ever these eyes yet looked on next i pitied him and so would any young wench o' my conscience that ever dreamed or vowed her maidenhead to a young handsome man then i loved him extremely loved him infinitely loved him and yet he had a cousin fair as he too but in my heart was palamon and there lord what a coil he keeps to hear him sing in an evening what a heaven it is and yet his songs are sad ones fairer spoken was never gentleman when i come in to bring him water in a morning first he bows his noble body then salutes me thus fair gentle maid good morrow may thy goodness get thee a happy husband once he kissed me i loved my lips the better ten days after would he would do so ev'ry day he grieves much  and me as much to see his misery what should i do to make him know i love him for i would fain enjoy him say i ventured to set him free what says the law then thus much for law or kindred i will do it and this night or tomorrow he shall love me let all the dukes and all the devils roar he is at liberty i have ventured for him and out i have brought him to a little wood a mile hence i have sent him where a cedar higher than all the rest spreads like a plane fast by a brook and there he shall keep close till i provide him files and food for yet his iron bracelets are not off o love what a stout hearted child thou art my father durst better have endured cold iron than done it i love him beyond love and beyond reason or wit or safety i have made him know it i care not i am desperate if the law find me and then condemn me for 't some wenches some honest hearted maids will sing my dirge and tell to memory my death was noble dying almost a martyr that way he takes i purpose is my way too sure he cannot be so unmanly as to leave me here if he do maids will not so easily trust men again and yet he has not thanked me for what i have done no not so much as kissed me and that methinks is not so well nor scarcely could i persuade him to become a free man he made such scruples of the wrong he did to me and to my father yet i hope when he

tongue's sweet melody were the world mine demetrius being bated the rest i'd give to be to you translated o teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius' heart o that your

can be through athens i am thought as fair as she but what of that demetrius thinks not so he will not know what all but he do know and as he errs doting on hermia's eyes so i admiring of his qualities things base and vile holding no quantity love can transpose to form and dignity love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is winged cupid painted blind nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste and therefore is love said to be a child because in choice he is so oft beguiled as waggish boys in game themselves forswear so the boy love is perjured everywhere for ere demetrius looked on hermia's eyne he hailed down oaths that he was only mine and when this hail some heat from hermia felt so he dissolved and show'rs of oaths did melt i will go tell him of fair hermia's flight then to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her and for this intelligence if i have thanks it is a dear expense but herein mean i to enrich my

follow you and even for that do i love you the more i am your spaniel and demetrius the more you beat me i will fawn on you use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me neglect me lose me only give

you do but you must join in souls to mock me too if you were men as men you are in show you would not use a gentle lady so to vow and swear and superpraise my parts when i am sure you hate me with

sex as well as i may chide you for it though i alone do feel the injury have you not set lysander as in scorn to follow me and praise my eyes and face and made your other love demetrius who even but now did spurn me with his foot to call me goddess nymph divine and rare precious celestial wherefore speaks he this to her he hates and wherefore doth lysander deny your love so rich within his soul and tender me forsooth affection but by your setting on by your consent what though i be not so in grace as you so hung upon with love so fortunate but miserable most to love unloved this you should pity rather than despise ay do persever counterfeit sad looks make mouths upon me when i turn my back wink each at other hold the sweet jest up this sport well carried shall be chronicled if you have

folly back and follow you no further let me go you see how simple and how fond i am a foolish heart that i leave here behind with demetrius o when she is angry she is keen and shrewd she was a vixen when she went to school and though she be but little she is fierce i will not trust you i nor longer stay in your curst company your hands than mine are quicker for a fray my legs are longer though to run away o weary night o long and tedious night abate thy hours shine comforts from the east that i may back to athens by daylight from these that my poor company detest and sleep that sometimes shuts

me sight of her not only bought many presents to give her but have given largely to many to know what she would have given briefly i have pursued her as love hath pursued me which hath been on the wing of all occasions but whatsoever i have merited either in my mind or in my means meed i am sure i have received none unless experience be a jewel that i have purchased at an infinite rate and that hath taught me to say this love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues never never like a fair house built on another man's ground so that i have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where i erected it when i have told you that i have told you all some say that though she appear honest to me yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so

break a thousand oaths to reign one year i hear their drums let's set our men in order and issue forth and bid them battle straight i wonder how our princely father scaped or whether he be scaped away or no from clifford's and northumberland's pursuit had he been ta'en we should have heard the news had he been slain we should have heard the news or had he scaped methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape how fares my brother why is he so sad dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns 'tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of i think it cites us brother to the field that we the sons of brave plantagenet each one already blazing by our meeds should notwithstanding join our lights together and overshine the earth as this the world whate'er it bodes henceforward will i bear upon my target three fair shining suns o speak no more for i have heard too much sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay o clifford

duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left o warwick warwick that plantagenet which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption is by the stern lord clifford done to death where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou fail'st as god forbid the hour  must edward fall which peril heaven forfend then strike up drums god and saint george for us now perjured henry wilt thou kneel for grace and set thy diadem upon my head or bide the mortal fortune of the field i am his king and he should bow his knee i was adopted heir by his consent since when his oath is broke for as i hear you that are king though he do wear the crown have caused him by new act of parliament to blot out me and put his own son in say henry shall i have my right or no a thousand men have broke their fasts today that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns to make this shameless callet know herself  helen of greece was fairer far than thou although thy husband may be menelaus and ne'er was agamemnon's brother wronged by that false woman as this king by thee his father reveled in the heart of france and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop and had he matched according to his state he might have kept that glory to this day but when he took a beggar to his bed and graced thy poor sire with his bridal day even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him that washed his father's fortunes forth of france and heaped sedition on his crown at home for what hath broached this tumult but thy pride hadst thou been meek our title still had slept and we in pity of the gentle king had slipped our claim until another age and in this resolution i defy thee not willing any longer conference since thou denied'st the gentle king to speak  sound trumpets let our bloody colors wave and either victory or else a grave no wrangling woman we'll no longer stay these words will cost ten thousand lives this day smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death for this world frowns and edward's sun is clouded bootless is flight they follow us with wings and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit o warwick i do bend my knee with thine and in this vow do chain my soul to thine and ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee thou setter up and plucker down of kings beseeching thee if with thy will it stands that to my foes this body must be prey yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope and give sweet passage to my sinful soul now lords take leave until we meet again where'er it be in heaven or in earth now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks some troops pursue the bloody minded queen that led calm henry though he were a king as doth a sail filled with a fretting gust command an argosy to stem the waves but think you lords that clifford fled with them see who it is and now the battle's ended if friend or foe let him be gently used bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threat'ning sound and his ill boding tongue no more shall speak clifford repent in bootless penitence thou pitied'st rutland i will pity thee even as thou wilt sweet

service wilt thou do me if i give them but you will take exceptions to my boon ay but thou canst do what i mean to ask an easy task 'tis but to love a king why then thy husband's lands i freely give thee but stay thee 'tis the fruits of love i mean ay but i fear me in another sense what love think'st thou i sue so much to get no by my troth i did not mean such love but now you partly may perceive my mind to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily ay if thou wilt say ay to my request no if thou dost say no to my demand her looks doth argue her replete with modesty her words doth show her wit incomparable all her perfections challenge sovereignty one way or other she is for a king and she shall be my love or else my queen  say that king edward take thee for his queen sweet widow by my state i swear to thee i speak no more than what my soul intends and that is to enjoy thee for my love you cavil widow i did mean my queen no more than when my daughters call thee mother thou art a widow and thou hast some children and by god's mother i being but a bachelor have other some why 'tis a happy thing to be the father unto many sons answer no more for thou shalt be my queen brothers you muse what chat we two have had you'd think it strange if i should marry her why clarence to myself well jest on brothers i can tell you both her suit is granted for her husband's lands see that he be conveyed unto the tower and go we brothers to the man that took him to question of his apprehension  widow go you along lords use her honorably now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent suppose they take offense without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwick's and must have my will yea brother richard are you offended too setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england's queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think what if both lewis and warwick be appeased by such invention as i can devise ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brother's will my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath now messenger what letters or what news from france go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henry's queen for i have heard that she was there in place belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarned they shall have wars and pay for their presumption but say is warwick friends with margaret clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i armed against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desp'rate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect now brother richard will you stand by us why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign power the duke why warwick when we parted thou call'dst me king yea brother of clarence art thou here too nay then i see that edward needs must down yet warwick in despite of all mischance of thee thyself and all thy complices edward will always bear himself as king though fortune's malice overthrow my state my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel what fates impose that men must needs abide it boots not to resist both wind and tide nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand  now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest stand you thus close to steal the bishop's deer but whither shall we then stanley i will requite thy forwardness huntsman what sayst thou wilt thou go along bishop farewell shield thee from warwick's frown and pray that i may repossess the crown now brother richard lord hastings and the rest yet thus far fortune maketh us amends and says that once more i shall interchange my wan\u00e8d state for henry's regal crown well have we passed and now re passed the seas and brought desir\u00e8d help from burgundy what then remains we being thus arrived from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york but that we enter as into our dukedom tush man abodements must not now affright us by fair or foul means we must enter in for hither will our friends repair to us but master mayor if henry be your king yet edward at the least is duke of york why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom as being well content with that alone so master mayor these gates must not be shut but in the night or in the time of war what fear not man but yield me up the keys for edward will defend the town and thee and all those friends that deign to follow me welcome sir john but why come you in arms thanks good montgomery but we now forget our title to the crown and only claim our dukedom till god please to send the rest nay stay sir john a while and we'll debate by what safe means the crown may be recovered when we grow stronger

fortune serve me i'll requite this kindness now for this night let's harbor here in york and when the morning sun shall raise his car above the border of this horizon we'll forward towards warwick and

soldiers doubt not of the day and that once gotten doubt not of large pay seize on the shamefaced henry bear him hence and once again proclaim us king of england  you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow now stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dry and swell so much the higher by their ebb  hence with him to the tower let him not speak and lords towards coventry bend we our course where peremptory warwick now remains the sun shines hot and if we use delay cold biting winter mars our hoped for hay go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle now warwick wilt thou ope the city gates speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee call edward king and at his hands beg mercy and he shall pardon thee these outrages why then 'tis mine if but by warwick's gift but warwick's king is edward's prisoner and gallant warwick do but answer this what is the body when the head is off 'tis even so yet you are warwick still sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend this hand fast wound about thy coal black hair shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off write in the dust this sentence with thy blood wind changing warwick now can change no more so other foes may set upon our backs stand we in good array for they no doubt will issue out again and bid us battle if not the city being but of small defense we'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same the harder matched the greater victory my mind presageth happy gain and conquest now welcome more and ten times more beloved than if thou never hadst deserved our hate what warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight or shall we beat the stones about thine ears yes warwick edward dares and leads the way  lords to the field saint george and victory so lie thou there die thou and die our fear for warwick was a bug that feared us all now montague sit fast i seek for thee that warwick's bones may keep thine company thus far our fortune keeps an upward course and we are graced with wreaths of victory but in the midst of this bright shining day i spy a black suspicious threat'ning cloud that will encounter with our glorious sun ere he attain his easeful western bed i mean my lords those powers that the queen hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast and as we hear march on to fight with us we are advertised by our loving friends that they do hold their course toward tewkesbury we having now the best at barnet field will thither straight for willingness rids way and as we march our strength will be augmented in every county as we go along strike up the drum cry courage and away brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood which by the heavens' assistance and your strength must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night i need not add more fuel to your fire for well i wot you blaze to burn them out give signal to the fight and to it lords now here a period of tumultuous broils away with oxford to hames castle straight for somerset off with his guilty head go bear them hence i will not hear them speak is proclamation made that who finds edward shall have a high reward and he his life bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak what can so young a thorn begin to prick  edward what satisfaction canst thou make for bearing arms for stirring up my subjects and all the trouble thou hast turned me to peace willful boy or i will charm your tongue take that the likeness of this railer

somerset threefold renowned for hardy and undoubted champions two cliffords as the father and the son and two northumberlands two braver men ne'er spurred their coursers at the trumpet's sound with them the two brave bears warwick and montague that in their chains fettered the kingly lion and made the forest tremble when they roared thus have we swept suspicion from our seat and made our footstool of security  come hither bess and let me kiss my boy  young ned for thee thine uncles and myself have in our armors watched the winter's night went all afoot in summer's scalding heat that

house of lancaster usurps i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close this is the palace of the fearful king and this the regal seat possess it york for this is thine and not king henry's heirs' and when the king comes offer him no violence unless he seek to thrust you out perforce the bloody parliament shall this be called unless plantagenet duke of york be king and bashful henry deposed whose cowardice hath made us bywords to our enemies neither the king nor he that loves him best the proudest he that holds up lancaster dares stir a wing if warwick shake his bells i'll plant plantagenet root him up who dares resolve thee richard claim the english crown exeter thou art a traitor to the crown in following this usurping henry true clifford that's richard duke of york be duke of lancaster let him be king and warwick shall disprove it you forget that we are those which chased you from the field and slew your fathers and with colors spread marched through the city to the palace gates poor clifford how i scorn his worthless threats talk not of france sith thou hast lost it all plantagenet shall speak first hear him lords and be you silent and attentive too for he that interrupts him shall not live prove it henry and thou shalt be king suppose my lords he did it unconstrained think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown deposed he shall be in despite of all do right unto this princely duke of york or i will fill the house with arm\u00e8d men and over the chair of state where now he sits write up his title with usurping blood what good is this to england and himself turn this way henry and regard them not why should you sigh my lord long live king henry plantagenet embrace him and i'll keep london with my soldiers how now fair lords what fare what news abroad ten days ago i drowned these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befall'n after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i then in london keeper of the king mustered my soldiers gathered flocks of friends marched toward saint albans to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertis\u00e8d that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henry's oath and your succession short tale to make we at saint albans met our battles joined and both sides fiercely fought but whether 'twas the coldness of the king who looked full gently on his warlike queen that robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether 'twas report of her success or more than common fear of clifford's rigor who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers' like the night owl's lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheered them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste posthaste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henry's head and wring the awful scepter from his fist were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague attend me lords the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many more proud birds have wrought the easy melting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enroll\u00e8d in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster their power i think is thirty thousand strong now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via to london will we march and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and fly no longer earl of march but duke of york the next degree is england's royal throne for king of england shalt thou be proclaimed in every borough as we pass along and he that throws not up his cap for joy shall for the fault make forfeit of his head king edward valiant richard montague stay we no longer dreaming of renown but sound the trumpets and about our task how now what news why then it sorts brave warriors let's away what sayst thou henry wilt thou yield the crown then 'twas my turn to fly and now 'tis thine 'twas not your valor clifford drove me thence if thou deny their blood upon thy head for york in justice puts his armor on forspent with toil as runners with a race i lay me down a little while to breathe for strokes received and many blows repaid have robbed my strong knit sinews of their strength and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile how now my lord what hap what hope of good then let the earth be drunken with our blood i'll kill my horse because i will not fly why stand we like soft hearted women here wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage and look upon as if the tragedy were played in jest by counterfeiting actors here on my knee i vow to god above i'll never pause again never stand still till either death hath closed these eyes of mine or fortune given me measure of revenge away away once more sweet lords farewell no 'tis impossible he should escape for though before his face i speak the words your brother richard marked him for the grave and wheresoe'er he is he's surely dead from off the gates of york fetch down the head your father's head which clifford plac\u00e8d there instead whereof let this supply the room measure for measure must be answer\u00e8d i think his understanding is bereft  speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee  dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say clifford devise excuses for thy faults they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont ay but he's dead off with the traitor's head and rear it in the place your father's stands and now to london with triumphant march there to be crown\u00e8d england's royal king from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france and ask the lady bona for thy queen so shalt thou sinew both these lands together and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread the scattered foe that hopes to rise again for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears first will i see the coronation and then to brittany i'll cross the sea to effect this marriage so it please my lord tut that's a foolish observation richard be duke of gloucester now to london to see these honors in possession from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vow\u00e8d friend i come in kindness and unfeign\u00e8d love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to england's king in lawful marriage and gracious madam in our king's behalf i am commanded with your leave and favor humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereign's heart where fame late ent'ring at his heedful ears hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue injurious margaret because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more art prince than she is queen oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry the fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdom's worth can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king and i the house of york thereon i pawn my credit and mine honor the more that henry was unfortunate such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fixed in virtue's ground the leaves and fruit maintained with beauty's sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing nothing can he lose  and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better 'twere you troubled him than france mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edward's  no more my king for he dishonors me but most himself if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death did i let pass th' abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdoned at the last with shame shame on himself for my desert is honor and to repair my honor lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state so much his friend ay his unfeign\u00e8d friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers i'll undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war 'tis not his new made bride shall succor him and as for clarence as my letters tell me he's very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honor or than for strength and safety of our country and mine fair lady bona joins with yours tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i'll uncrown him ere 't be long there's thy reward be gone this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree i'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raised him to the crown and i'll be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henry's misery but seek revenge on edward's mockery trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us but see where somerset and clarence comes  speak suddenly my lords are we all friends then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawned an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edward's brother were but a feign\u00e8d friend to our proceedings but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in night's coverture thy brother being carelessly encamped his soldiers lurking in the town about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomed with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus' tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well covered with the night's black mantle at unawares may beat down edward's guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader why then let's on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends god and saint george this is his tent and see where stand his guard courage my masters honor now or never but follow me and edward shall be ours richard and hastings let them go here is the duke ay but the case is altered when you disgraced me in my embassade then i degraded you from being king and come now to create you duke of york alas how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassadors nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the people's welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies then for his mind be edward england's king but henry now shall wear the english crown and be true king indeed thou but the shadow  my lord of somerset at my request see that forthwith duke edward be conveyed unto my brother archbishop of york when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows i'll follow you and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him  now for awhile farewell good duke of york ay that's the first thing that we have to do to free king henry from imprisonment and see him seated in the regal throne your grace hath still been famed for virtuous and now may seem as wise as virtuous by spying and avoiding fortune's malice for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace for choosing me when clarence is in place and i choose clarence only for protector what answers clarence to his sovereign's will why then though loath yet must i be content we'll yoke together like a double shadow to henry's body and supply his place  i mean in bearing weight of government  while he enjoys the honor and his ease and clarence now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor and all his lands and goods be confiscate ay therein clarence shall not want his part what news my friend unsavory news but how made he escape my brother was too careless of his charge but let us hence my sovereign to provide a salve for any sore that may betide what counsel lords edward from belgia with hasty germans and blunt hollanders hath passed in safety through the narrow seas and with his troops doth march amain to london and many giddy people flock to him in warwickshire i have true hearted friends not mutinous in peace yet bold in war those will i muster up and thou son clarence shalt stir up in suffolk norfolk and in kent the knights and gentlemen to come with thee  thou brother montague in buckingham northampton and in leicestershire shalt find men well inclined to hear what thou command'st  and thou brave oxford wondrous well beloved in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends  my sovereign with the loving citizens like to his island girt in with the ocean or modest dian circled with her nymphs shall rest in london till we come to him fair lords take leave and stand not to reply  farewell my sovereign farewell sweet lords let's meet at coventry where is the post that came from valiant oxford  how far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow how far off is our brother montague where is the post that came from montague say somerville what says my loving son and by thy guess how nigh is clarence now then clarence is at hand i hear his drum who should that be belike unlooked for friends o unbid spite is sportful edward come where slept our scouts or how are they seduced that we could hear no news of his repair nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence confess who set thee up and plucked thee down call warwick patron and be penitent and thou shalt still remain the duke of york is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift 'twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother thou art no atlas for so great a weight and weakling warwick takes his gift again and henry is my king warwick his subject i had rather chop this hand off at a blow and with the other fling it at thy face than bear so low a sail to strike to thee o cheerful colors see where oxford comes o welcome oxford for we want thy help and lo where george of clarence sweeps along of force enough to bid his brother battle with whom an upright zeal to right prevails more than the nature of a brother's love  come clarence come thou wilt if warwick call o passing traitor perjured and unjust alas i am not cooped here for defense i will away towards barnet presently and bid thee battle edward if thou dar'st ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe and tell me who is victor york or warwick why ask i that my mangled body shows my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows that i must yield my body to the earth and by my fall the conquest to my foe thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle under whose shade the ramping lion slept whose top branch overpeered jove's spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind these eyes that now are dimmed with death's black veil have been as piercing as the midday sun to search the secret treasons of the world the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood were likened oft to kingly sepulchers for who lived king but i could dig his grave and who durst smile when warwick bent his brow lo now my glory smeared in dust and blood my parks my walks my manors that i had even now forsake me and of all my lands is nothing left me but my body's length why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust and live we how we can yet die we must why then i would not fly ah montague if thou be there sweet brother take my hand and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile thou lov'st me not for brother if thou didst thy tears would wash this cold congeal\u00e8d blood that glues my lips and will not let me speak come quickly montague or i am dead sweet rest his soul fly

it of such childish friendliness to yield your voices thus to have said as you were fore advised had touched his spirit and tried his inclination from him plucked either his gracious promise which you might as cause had called you up have held him to or else it would have galled his surly nature which easily endures not article tying him to aught so putting him to rage you should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler and passed him unelected have you ere now denied the asker and now again of him that did not ask but mock bestow your sued for tongues let them assemble and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election enforce his pride and his old hate unto you besides forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed how in his suit he scorned you but your loves thinking upon his services took from you th' apprehension of his present portance which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion after the inveterate hate he bears you say you chose him more after our commandment than as guided by your own true affections and that your minds preoccupied with what you rather must do than what you should made you against the grain to voice him consul lay the fault on us one thus descended that hath besides well in his person wrought to be set high in place we did commend to your remembrances but you have found scaling his present bearing with his past that he's your

where is this viper that would depopulate the city and be every man himself he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous hands he hath resisted law and therefore law shall scorn him further trial than the severity of the public power which he so sets at naught peace sir how comes 't that you have holp to make this rescue consul what consul speak briefly then for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor to eject him hence were but one danger and to keep him here our certain death therefore it is decreed he dies tonight he's a disease that must be cut away this is clean

officers and are content to suffer lawful censure for such faults as shall be proved upon you answer to us we charge you that you have contrived to take from rome all seasoned office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical for which you are a traitor to the people mark you this people peace we need not put new matter to his charge what you have seen him do and heard him speak beating your officers cursing yourselves opposing laws with strokes and here defying those whose great power must try him even this so criminal and in such capital kind deserves th' extremest death for that he has as much as in him lies from time to time envied against the people seeking means to pluck away their power as now at last given hostile strokes and that not in the presence of dreaded justice but on the ministers that doth distribute it in the name o' th' people and in the power of us the tribunes we even from this instant banish him our city in peril of precipitation from off the rock tarpeian never more to enter our rome gates i' th' people's name i say it shall be so he's sentenced no more hearing we know your drift speak what go see him out at gates and follow him as he hath followed you with all despite give him deserved vexation let a guard attend us through the city bid them all home he's gone and we'll no further the nobility are vexed whom we see have sided in his behalf bid them home say their great enemy is gone and they stand in their ancient strength let's not meet her they say she's mad are you mankind o bless\u00e8d heavens what then i would he had continued to his country as he began and not unknit himself the noble knot he made why stay we to be baited with one that wants her wits we hear not of him neither need we fear him his remedies are tame the present peace and quietness of the people which before were in wild hurry here do we make his friends blush that the world goes well who rather had though they themselves did suffer by 't

coriolanus is not much missed but with his friends the commonwealth doth stand and so would do were he more angry at it where is he hear you good e'en our neighbors live and thrive farewell farewell this is a happier and more comely time than when these fellows ran about the streets crying confusion and affecting one sole throne without assistance we should by this to all our lamentation if he had gone forth consul found it so come what talk you of martius tell not me i know this cannot be 'tis this slave  go whip him 'fore the people's eyes his raising nothing but his report what more fearful this is most likely the very trick on 't say not we brought it go masters get you home be not dismayed these are a side that would be glad to have this true which they so seem to fear go home and show no sign of fear nor i pray let's go nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid in this so never needed help yet do not upbraid 's with our distress but sure if you would be your country's pleader your good tongue more than the instant army we can make might stop our countryman pray you go to him yet your good will must have that thanks from rome after the measure as you intended well not why what of that is 't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man he loved his mother dearly yes mercy if you report him truly the gods be good unto us what's the news friend

you anointed deputies of heaven to thee king john my holy errand is i pandulph of fair milan cardinal and from pope innocent the legate here do in his name religiously demand why thou against the church our holy mother so willfully dost spurn and force perforce keep stephen langton chosen archbishop of canterbury from that holy see this in our foresaid holy father's name pope innocent i do demand of thee then by the lawful power that i have thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate and bless\u00e8d shall he be that doth revolt from his allegiance to an heretic and meritorious shall that hand be called canoniz\u00e8d and worshiped as a saint that takes away by any secret course thy hateful life there's law and warrant lady for my curse philip of france on peril of a curse let go the hand of that arch heretic and raise the power of france upon his head unless he do submit himself to rome what canst thou say but will perplex thee more if thou stand excommunicate and cursed all form is formless order orderless save what is opposite to england's love therefore to arms be champion of our church or let the church our mother breathe her curse a mother's curse on her revolting son france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue a chaf\u00e8d lion by the mortal paw a fasting tiger safer by the tooth than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold so mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith and like a civil war sett'st oath to oath thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow first made to god first be to god performed that is to be the champion of our church what since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself and may not be perform\u00e8d by thyself for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss is not amiss when it is truly done and being not done where doing tends to ill the truth is then most done not doing it the better act of purposes mistook is to mistake again though indirect yet indirection thereby grows direct and falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire within the scorch\u00e8d veins of one new burned it is religion that doth make vows kept but thou hast sworn against religion by what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st and mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth against an oath the truth thou art unsure to swear swears only not to be forsworn else what a mockery should it be to swear but thou dost swear only to be forsworn and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear therefore thy later vows against thy first is in thyself rebellion to thyself and better conquest never canst thou make than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts against these giddy loose suggestions upon which better part our prayers come in if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know the peril of our curses light on thee so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off but in despair die under their black weight i will denounce a curse upon his head courage and comfort all shall yet go well lady you utter madness and not sorrow you hold too heinous a respect of grief before the curing of a strong disease even in the instant of repair and health the fit is strongest evils that take leave on their departure most of all show evil what have you lost by losing of this day if you had won it certainly you had no no when fortune means to men most good she looks upon them with a threat'ning eye 'tis strange to think how much king john hath lost in this which he accounts so clearly won are not you grieved that arthur is his prisoner your mind is all as youthful as your blood now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit for even the breath of what i mean to speak shall blow each dust each straw each little rub out of the path which shall directly lead thy foot to england's throne and therefore mark john hath seized arthur and it cannot be that whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins the misplaced john should entertain an hour one minute nay one quiet breath of rest a scepter snatched with an unruly hand must be as boisterously maintained as gained and he that stands upon a slipp'ry place makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up that john may stand then arthur needs must fall so be it for it cannot be but so you in the right of lady blanche your wife may then make all the claim that arthur did how green you are and fresh in this old world john lays you plots the times conspire with you for he that steeps his safety in true blood shall find but bloody safety and untrue this act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts of all his people and freeze up their zeal that none so small advantage shall step forth to check his reign but they will cherish it no natural exhalation in the sky no scope of nature no distempered day no common wind no custom\u00e8d event but they will pluck away his natural cause and call them meteors prodigies and signs abortives presages and tongues of heaven plainly denouncing vengeance upon john o sir when he shall hear of your approach if that young arthur be not gone already even at that news he dies and then the hearts of all his people shall revolt from him and kiss the lips of unacquainted change and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath out of the bloody fingers' ends of john methinks i see this hurly all on foot and o what better matter breeds for you than i have named the bastard faulconbridge is now in england ransacking the church offending charity if but a dozen french were there in arms they would be as a call to train ten thousand english to their side or as a little snow tumbled about anon becomes a mountain o noble dauphin go with me to the king 'tis wonderful what may be wrought out of their discontent now that their souls are topful of offense for england go i will whet on the king take again from this my hand as holding of the pope your sovereign greatness and authority it

land on this ascension day remember well upon your oath of service to the pope go i to make the french lay down their arms hail noble prince of france the next is this king john hath reconciled himself to rome his spirit is come in that so stood out against the holy church the great metropolis and see of rome therefore thy threat'ning colors now wind up and tame the savage spirit of wild war that like a lion fostered up at hand it may lie gently at the foot of peace and be no further harmful than in show you look but on the outside of this work the dauphin is too willful opposite and will

cardinal they vent reproaches most bitterly on you as putter on of these exactions yet the king our master whose honor heaven shield from soil even he escapes not language unmannerly yea such which breaks the sides of loyalty and almost appears in loud rebellion no my lord you know no more than others but you frame things that are known alike which are not wholesome to those which would not know them and yet must perforce be their acquaintance these exactions whereof my sovereign would have note they are most pestilent to th' hearing and to bear 'em the back is sacrifice to th' load they say they are devised by you or else you suffer too hard an exclamation i am much too venturous in tempting of your patience but am boldened under your promised pardon the subjects' grief comes through

twenty years and have been blessed with many children by you if in the course and process of this time you can report and prove it too against mine honor aught my bond to wedlock or my love and duty against your sacred person in god's name turn me away and let the foul'st contempt shut door upon me and so give me up to the sharp'st kind of justice please you sir the king your father was reputed for a prince most prudent of an excellent and unmatched wit and judgment ferdinand my father king of spain was reckoned one the wisest prince that there had reigned by many a year before it is not to be questioned that they had gathered a wise council to them of every realm that did debate this business who deemed our marriage lawful wherefore i humbly beseech you sir to spare me till i may be by my friends in spain advised whose counsel i will implore if not i' th' name of god your pleasure be fulfilled lord cardinal to you i speak sir i am about to weep but thinking that we are a queen or

you both for your good wills you speak like honest men pray god you prove so but how to make you suddenly an answer in such a point of weight so near mine honor  more near my life i fear with my weak wit and to such men of gravity and learning in truth i know not i was set at work among my maids full little god knows looking either for such men or such business for her sake that i have been for i feel the last fit of my greatness good your graces let me have time and counsel for my cause alas i am a woman friendless hopeless in england but little for my profit can you think lords that any englishman dare give me counsel or be a known friend 'gainst his highness' pleasure though he be grown so desperate to be honest and live a subject nay forsooth my friends they that must weigh out my afflictions they that my trust must grow to live not here they are as all my other comforts far hence in mine own country lords how sir you tell me what you wish for both my ruin is this your

sins and hollow hearts i fear you mend 'em for shame my lords is this your comfort the cordial that you bring a wretched lady a woman lost among you laughed at scorned i will not wish you half my miseries i have more charity but say i warned you take heed for heaven's sake take heed lest at once the burden of my sorrows fall upon you you turn me into nothing woe upon you and all such false professors would you have me  if you have any justice any pity if you be anything but churchmen's habits  put my sick cause into his hands that hates me alas has banished me his bed already his love

king loved him next heav'n obeyed him been out of fondness superstitious to him almost forgot my prayers to content him and am i thus rewarded 'tis not well lords bring me a constant woman to her husband one that ne'er dreamed a joy beyond his pleasure and to that woman when she has done most yet will i add an honor a great patience my lord i dare not make myself so guilty to give up willingly that noble title your master wed me to nothing but death shall e'er divorce my dignities would i had never trod this english earth or felt the flatteries that grow upon it you have angels' faces but heaven knows your hearts what will become of me now wretched lady i am the most unhappy woman living alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes shipwracked upon a kingdom where no pity no friends no hope no kindred weep for me almost no grave allowed me like the lily that once was mistress of the field and flourished i'll hang my head and perish do what you will my lords and pray forgive me if i have used myself unmannerly you know i am a woman lacking wit to make a seemly answer to such persons pray do my service to his majesty he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers while i shall

cardinal wolsey was dead prithee good griffith tell me how he died if well he stepped before me happily for my example alas poor man so may he rest his faults lie gently on him yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him and yet with charity he was a man of an unbounded stomach ever ranking himself with princes one that by suggestion tied all the kingdom simony was fair play his own opinion was his law i' th' presence he would say untruths and be ever double both in his words and meaning he was never but where he meant to ruin pitiful his promises were as he then was mighty but his performance as he is now nothing of his own body he was ill and gave the clergy ill example yes good griffith i were malicious else after my death i wish no other herald no other speaker of my living actions to keep mine honor from corruption but such an honest chronicler as griffith whom i most hated living thou hast made me with thy religious truth and modesty now in his ashes honor peace be with him  patience be near me still and set me lower i have not long to trouble thee good griffith cause the musicians play me that sad note i named my knell whilst i sit meditating on that celestial harmony i go to spirits of peace where are you are you all gone and leave me here in wretchedness behind you it is not you i call for saw you none enter since i slept no saw you not even now a blessed troop invite me to a banquet whose bright faces cast thousand beams upon me like the sun they promised me eternal happiness and brought me garlands griffith which i feel i am not worthy yet to wear i shall assuredly bid the music leave they are harsh and heavy to me you are a saucy fellow deserve we no more reverence admit him entrance griffith but this fellow let me ne'er see again if my sight fail not you should be lord ambassador from the emperor my royal nephew and your name capuchius o my lord the times and titles now are altered strangely with me since first you knew me but i pray you what is your pleasure with me o my good lord that comfort comes too late 'tis like a pardon after execution that gentle physic given in time had cured me but now i am past all comforts here but prayers how does his highness so may he ever do and ever flourish when i shall dwell with worms and my poor name banished the kingdom patience is that letter i caused you write yet sent away sir i most humbly pray you to deliver this to my lord the king  in which i have commended to his goodness the model of our chaste loves his young daughter  the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her  beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding  she is young and of a noble modest nature i hope she will deserve well and a little to love her for her mother's sake that loved him heaven knows how dearly my next poor petition is that his noble grace would have some pity upon my wretched women that so long have followed both my fortunes faithfully of which there is not one i dare avow  and now i should not lie but will deserve for virtue and true beauty of the soul for honesty and decent carriage a right good husband let him be a noble and sure those men are happy that shall have 'em the last is for my men they are the poorest but poverty could never draw 'em from me  that they may have their wages duly paid 'em and something over to remember me by if heaven had pleased to have given me longer life and able means we had not parted thus these are the whole contents and good my lord by that you love the dearest in this world as you wish christian peace to souls departed stand these poor people's friend and urge the king to do me this last right i thank you honest lord remember me in all humility unto his highness say his long trouble now is passing out of this world tell him in death i blessed him for so i will mine eyes grow dim farewell my lord griffith farewell nay patience you must not leave me yet i must to bed call in more women when i am dead good wench let me be used with honor strew me over with maiden flowers that all the world may know i was a chaste wife to my grave embalm me then lay me forth although unqueened yet like a queen and daughter to a king inter me

with silken streamers the young phoebus fanning play with your fancies and in them behold upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing hear the shrill whistle which doth order give to sounds confused behold the threaden sails borne with th' invisible and creeping wind draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea breasting the lofty surge o do but think you stand upon the rivage and behold a city on th' inconstant billows dancing for so appears this fleet majestical holding due course to harfleur follow follow grapple your minds to sternage of this navy and leave your england as dead midnight still guarded with grandsires babies and old women either past or not arrived to pith and puissance for who is he whose chin is but enriched with one appearing hair that will not follow these culled and choice drawn cavaliers to france work work your thoughts and therein see a siege behold the ordnance on their carriages with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur suppose th' ambassador from the french comes back tells harry that the king doth offer him katherine his daughter and with her to dowry some petty and unprofitable dukedoms the offer likes not and the nimble gunner with linstock now the devilish cannon touches and down goes all before them still be kind and eke out our performance with your mind now entertain conjecture of a time when creeping murmur and the poring dark fills the wide vessel of the universe from camp to camp through the foul womb of night the hum of either army stilly sounds that the fixed sentinels almost receive the secret whispers of each other's watch fire answers fire and through their paly flames each battle sees the other's umbered face steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs piercing the night's dull ear and from the tents the armorers accomplishing the knights with busy hammers closing rivets up give dreadful note of preparation the country cocks do crow the clocks do toll and the third hour of drowsy morning named proud of their numbers and secure in soul the confident and overlusty french do the low rated english play at dice and chide the cripple tardy gaited night who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp so tediously away the poor condemn\u00e8d english like sacrifices by their watchful fires sit patiently and inly ruminate the morning's danger and their gesture sad investing lank lean cheeks and war worn coats presenteth them unto the gazing moon so many horrid ghosts o now who will behold the royal captain of this ruined band walking from watch to watch from tent to tent let him cry praise and glory on his head for forth he goes and visits all his host bids them good morrow with a modest smile and calls them brothers friends and countrymen upon his royal face there is no note how dread an army hath enrounded him nor doth he dedicate one jot of color unto the weary and all watch\u00e8d night but freshly looks and overbears attaint with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty that every wretch pining and pale before beholding him plucks comfort from his looks a largesse universal like the sun his liberal eye doth give to everyone thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all behold as may unworthiness define a little touch of harry in the night and so our scene must to the battle fly where o for pity we shall much disgrace with four or five most vile and ragged foils right ill disposed in brawl ridiculous the name of agincourt yet sit and see minding true things by what their mock'ries be vouchsafe to those that have not read the story that i may prompt them and of such as have i humbly pray them to admit th' excuse of time of numbers and due course of things which cannot in their huge and proper life be here presented now we bear the king toward calais grant him there there seen heave him away upon your wing\u00e8d thoughts athwart the sea behold the english beach pales in the flood with men wives and boys whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep mouthed sea which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king seems to prepare his way so let him land and solemnly see him set on to london so swift a pace hath thought that even now you may imagine him upon blackheath where that his lords desire him to have borne his bruis\u00e8d helmet and his bended sword before him through the city he forbids it being free from vainness and self glorious pride giving full trophy signal and ostent quite from himself to god but now behold in the quick forge and workinghouse of thought how london doth pour out her citizens the mayor and all his brethren in best sort like to the senators of th' antique rome with the plebeians swarming at their heels go forth and fetch their conqu'ring caesar in  as by a lower but by loving likelihood were now the general of our gracious empress as in good time he may from ireland coming bringing rebellion broach\u00e8d on his sword how many would the peaceful city quit to welcome him much more and much more cause did they this harry now in london place him as yet the lamentation of the french invites the king of england's stay at home the emperor's coming in behalf of france to order peace between them and omit all the occurrences whatever chanced till harry's back return again to france there must we bring him and myself have played the interim by remembering you 'tis past then brook abridgment and your eyes advance after your thoughts straight back again to france thus far with rough and all unable pen our bending author hath pursued the story in little room confining mighty men mangling by starts the full course of their glory small time but in that small most greatly lived this star of england fortune made his sword by which the world's best garden he achieved and of it left his son imperial lord henry the sixth in infant bands crowned king of france and england did this king succeed whose state so many had the managing that they lost france and made his england bleed which oft our stage hath shown and for their sake in your fair minds let this acceptance take", "Ado_Hero": "my cousin means signior benedick of padua he is of a very melancholy disposition so you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing i am yours for the walk and especially when i walk away i may say so when i please when i like your favor for god defend the lute should be like the case why then your visor should be thatched i will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband good margaret run thee to the parlor there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursula walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheardst us and bid her steal into the pleach\u00e8d bower where honeysuckles ripened by the sun forbid the sun to enter like favorites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our propose this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupid's crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it  no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggards of the rock so says the prince and my new troth\u00e8d lord they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they loved benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it o god of love i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never framed a woman's heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprizing what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so self endeared why you speak truth i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featured but she would spell him backward if fair faced she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antic made a foul blot if tall a lance ill headed if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendable but who dare tell her so if i should speak she would mock me into air o she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit therefore let benedick like covered fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion and truly i'll devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio indeed he hath an excellent good name why every day tomorrow come go in i'll show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me tomorrow if it prove so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps good ursula wake my cousin beatrice and desire her to rise and bid her come hither no pray thee good meg i'll wear this my cousin's a fool and thou art another i'll wear none but this o that exceeds they say god give me joy to wear it for my heart is exceeding heavy fie upon thee art not ashamed good morrow coz why how now do you speak in the sick tune these gloves the count sent me they are an excellent perfume there thou prick'st her with a thistle help to dress me good coz good meg good ursula i do none my lord and seemed i ever otherwise to you is my lord well that he doth speak so wide true o god o god defend me how am i beset  what kind of catechizing call you this is it not hero who can blot that name with any just reproach i talked with no man at that hour my lord they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant let all my sins lack mercy o my father prove you that any man with me conversed at hours unmeet or that i yesternight maintained the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death and when i lived i was your other wife and when you loved you were my other husband nothing certainer one hero died defiled but i do live and surely as i live i am a maid and here's another writ in my cousin's hand stol'n from her pocket containing her affection unto benedick", "1H6_Suffolk": "within the temple hall we were too loud the garden here is more convenient faith i have been a truant in the law and never yet could frame my will to it and therefore frame the law unto my will i pluck this red rose with young somerset and say withal i think he held the right turn not thy scorns this way plantagenet i'll turn my part thereof into thy throat go forward and be choked with thy ambition and so farewell until i meet thee next welcome high prince the mighty duke of york be what thou wilt thou art my prisoner o fairest beauty do not fear nor fly for i will touch thee but with reverent hands i kiss these fingers for eternal peace and lay them gently on thy tender side who art thou say that i may honor thee an earl i am and suffolk am i called be not offended nature's miracle thou art allotted to be ta'en by me so doth the swan her downy cygnets save keeping them prisoner underneath her wings yet if this servile usage once offend go and be free again as suffolk's friend o stay i have no power to let her pass my hand would free her but my heart says no as plays the sun upon the glassy streams twinkling another counterfeited beam so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes fain would i woo her yet i dare not speak i'll call for pen and ink and write my mind fie de la pole disable not thyself hast not a tongue is she not here wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight ay beauty's princely majesty is such confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit before thou make a trial of her love she's beautiful and therefore to be wooed she is a woman therefore to be won fond man remember that thou hast a wife then how can margaret be thy paramour there all is marred there lies a cooling card and yet a dispensation may be had i'll win this lady margaret for whom why for my king tush that's a wooden thing yet so my fancy may be satisfied and peace establish\u00e8d between these realms but there remains a scruple in that too for though her father be the king of naples duke of anjou and maine yet is he poor and our nobility will scorn the match it shall be so disdain they ne'er so much henry is youthful and will quickly yield  madam i have a secret to reveal lady vouchsafe to listen what i say sweet madam give me hearing in a cause lady wherefore talk you so say gentle princess would you not suppose your bondage happy to be made a queen and so shall you if happy england's royal king be free i'll undertake to make thee henry's queen to put a golden scepter in thy hand and set a precious crown upon thy head if thou wilt condescend to be my  his love no gentle madam i unworthy am to woo so fair a dame to be his wife and have no portion in the choice myself how say you madam are you so content then call our captains and our colors forth and madam at your father's castle walls we'll crave a parley to confer with him see reignier see thy daughter prisoner to me yes there is remedy enough my lord consent and for thy honor give consent thy daughter shall be wedded to my king whom i with pain have wooed and won thereto and this her easy held imprisonment hath gained thy daughter princely liberty fair margaret knows that suffolk doth not flatter face or feign and here i will expect thy coming thanks reignier happy for so sweet a child fit to be made companion with a king what answer makes your grace unto my suit that is her ransom i deliver her and those two counties i will undertake your grace shall well and quietly enjoy reignier of france i give thee kingly thanks because this is in traffic of a king and yet methinks i could be well content to be mine own attorney in this case  i'll over then to england with this news and make this marriage to be solemnized so farewell reignier set this diamond safe in golden palaces as it becomes farewell sweet madam but hark you margaret no princely commendations to my king words sweetly placed and modestly directed but madam i must trouble you again no loving token to his majesty and this withal o wert thou for myself but suffolk stay thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth there minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk solicit henry with her wondrous praise bethink thee on her virtues that surmount and natural graces that extinguish art repeat their semblance often on the seas that when thou com'st to kneel at henry's feet thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder tush my good lord this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them would make a volume of enticing lines able to ravish any dull conceit and which is more she is not so divine so full replete with choice of all delights but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command  command i mean of virtuous chaste intents  to love and honor henry as her lord as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths or one that at a triumph having vowed to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversary's odds a poor earl's daughter is unequal odds and therefore may be broke without offense yes my lord her father is a king the king of naples and jerusalem and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance a dower my lords disgrace not so your king that he should be so abject base and poor to choose for wealth and not for perfect love henry is able to enrich his queen and not to seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives as market men for oxen sheep or horse marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship not whom we will but whom his grace affects must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore lords since he affects her most most of all these reasons bindeth us in our opinions she should be preferred for what is wedlock forc\u00e8d but a hell an age of discord and continual strife whereas the contrary bringeth bliss and is a pattern of celestial peace whom should we match with henry being a king but margaret that is daughter to a king her peerless feature join\u00e8d with her birth approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit more than in women commonly is seen will answer our hope in issue of a king for henry son unto a conqueror is likely to beget more conquerors if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be linked in love then yield my lords and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen and none but she thus suffolk hath prevailed and thus he goes as did the youthful paris once to greece with hope to find the like event in love but prosper better than the trojan did margaret shall now be queen and rule the king but i will rule both her the king and realm", "TNK_Arcite": "dear palamon dearer in love than blood and our prime cousin yet unhardened in the crimes of nature let us leave the city thebes and the temptings in 't before we further sully our gloss of youth and here to keep in abstinence we shame as in incontinence for not to swim i' th' aid o' th' current were almost to sink at least to frustrate striving and to follow the common stream 'twould bring us to an eddy where we should turn or drown if labor through our gain but life and weakness are you not out meet you no ruin but the soldier in the cranks and turns of thebes you did begin as if you met decays of many kinds perceive you none that do arouse your pity but th' unconsidered soldier 'tis not this i did begin to speak of this is virtue of no respect in thebes i spake of thebes  how dangerous if we will keep our honors it is for our residing where every evil hath a good color where every seeming good's a certain evil where not to be e'en jump as they are here were to be strangers and such things to be mere monsters our uncle creon clear spirited cousin let's leave his court that we may nothing share of his loud infamy for our milk will relish of the pasture and we must be vile or disobedient not his kinsmen in blood unless in quality let him approach but that we fear the gods in him he brings not a jot of terror to us yet what man thirds his own worth the case is each of ours  when that his action's dregged with mind assured 'tis bad he goes about so we must is 't said this

it and to that destiny have patiently laid up my hour to come no palamon those hopes are prisoners with us here we are and here the graces of our youths must wither like a too timely spring here age must find us and which is heaviest palamon unmarried the sweet embraces of a loving wife loaden with kisses armed with thousand cupids shall never clasp our necks no issue know us  no figures of ourselves shall we e'er see to glad our age and like young eagles teach 'em boldly to gaze against bright arms and say remember what your fathers were and conquer the fair eyed maids shall weep our banishments and in their songs curse ever blinded fortune till she for shame see what a wrong she has done to youth and nature this is all our world we shall know nothing here but one another hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes the vine shall grow but we shall never see it summer shall come and with her all delights but dead cold winter must inhabit here still yet cousin even from the bottom of these miseries from all that fortune can inflict upon us i see two comforts rising two mere blessings if the gods please to hold here a brave patience and the enjoying of our griefs together whilst palamon is with me let me perish if i think this our prison shall we make worthy uses of this place that all men hate so much let's think this prison holy sanctuary to keep us from corruption of worse men we are young and yet desire the ways of honor that liberty and common conversation the poison of pure spirits might like women woo us to wander from what worthy blessing can be but our imaginations may make it ours and here being thus together we are an endless mine to one another we are one another's wife ever begetting new births of love we are father friends acquaintance we are in one another families i am your heir and you are mine this place is our inheritance no hard oppressor dare take this from us here with a little patience we shall live long and loving no surfeits seek us the hand of war hurts none here nor the seas swallow their youth were we at liberty a wife might part us lawfully or business quarrels consume us envy of ill men crave our acquaintance i might sicken cousin where you should never know it and so perish without your noble hand to close mine eyes or prayers to the gods a thousand chances were we from hence would sever us i would hear you still sure there cannot till our deaths it cannot and after death our spirits shall be led to those that love eternally speak on sir pray forward will you go forward cousin cousin

troop no no 'tis well now i am perfect take my sword i hold it better and me my love is there aught else to say here palamon this hand shall never more come near thee with such friendship if i fall curse me and say i was a coward for none but such dare die in these just trials once more farewell my cousin lo cousin lo our folly has undone us this is the duke a hunting as i told you if we be found we are wretched o retire for honor's sake and safely presently into your bush again sir we shall find too many hours to die in gentle cousin if you be seen you perish instantly for breaking prison and i if you reveal me for my contempt then all the world will scorn us and say we had a noble difference but base disposers of it you are not mad then come what can come thou shalt know palamon i dare as well die as discourse or sleep only this fears me the law will have the honor of our ends have at thy life we seek not thy breath of mercy theseus 'tis to me a thing as soon to die

have brought my life here to confirm it as i have served her truest worthiest as i dare kill this cousin that denies it so let me be most traitor and you please me for scorning thy edict duke ask that lady why she is fair and why her eyes command me stay here to love her and if she say traitor i am a villain fit to lie unburied no never duke 'tis worse to me than begging to take my life so basely though i think i never shall enjoy her yet i'll preserve the honor of affection and die for her make death a devil with all our souls any death thou canst invent duke if she refuse me yet my grave will wed me and soldiers sing my epitaph i embrace you i am in labor to push your name your ancient love our kindred out of my memory and i' th' selfsame place to seat something i would confound so hoist we the sails that must these vessels port even where the heavenly limiter pleases one farewell farewell sir knights kinsmen lovers yea my sacrifices true worshippers of mars whose spirit in you

fierceness too yea the speed also to go on i mean else wish we to be snails you know my prize must be dragged out of blood force and great feat must put my garland on where she sticks the queen of flowers our intercession then must be to him that makes the camp a cistern brimmed with the blood of men give me your aid and bend your spirits towards him thou mighty one that with thy power hast turned green neptune into purple whose approach comets prewarn whose havoc in vast field unearth\u00e8d skulls proclaim whose breath blows down the teeming ceres' foison who dost pluck with hand armipotent from forth blue clouds the masoned turrets that both mak'st and break'st the stony girths of cities me thy pupil youngest follower of thy drum instruct this day with military skill that to

that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th' imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as 'twere with a defeated joy with an auspicious and a dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barred your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother's death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagu\u00e8d with this dream of his advantage he hath not failed to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears of this his nephew's purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell and now laertes what's the news with you you told us of some suit what is 't laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes have you your father's leave what says polonius take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will  but now my cousin hamlet and my son  how is it that the clouds still hang on you 'tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness 'tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschooled for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie 'tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son why 'tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again respeaking earthly thunder come away welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet's transformation so call it sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father's death that thus hath put him so much from th' understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and sith so neighbored to his youth and havior that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that opened lies within our remedy thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thou still hast been the father of good news o speak of that that do i long to hear thyself do grace to them and bring them in he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found the head and source of all your son's distemper well we shall sift him welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway it likes us well and at our more considered time we'll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labor go to your rest at night we'll feast together most welcome home but how hath she received his love as of a man faithful and honorable do you think 'tis this not that i know how may we try it further we will try it and can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose into these delights sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as 'twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behaved if 't be th' affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for o 'tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot's cheek beautied with plast'ring art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lacked form a little was not like madness there's something in his soul o'er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on 't it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatched go how fares our cousin hamlet i have nothing with this answer hamlet these words are not mine have you heard the argument is there no offense in 't what do you call the play give me some light away i like him not nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range therefore prepare you i your commission will forthwith dispatch and he to england shall along with you the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so near 's as doth hourly grow out of his brows arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage for we will fetters put about this fear which now goes too free footed thanks dear my lord o my offense is rank it smells to heaven it hath the primal eldest curse upon 't a brother's murder pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and like a man to double business bound i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect what if this curs\u00e8d hand were thicker than itself with brother's blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offense and what's in prayer but this twofold force to be forestall\u00e8d ere we come to fall or pardoned being down then i'll look up my fault is past but o what form of prayer can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder that cannot be since i am still possessed of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen may one be pardoned and retain th' offense in the corrupted currents of this world offense's gilded hand may shove by justice and oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law but 'tis not so above there is no shuffling there the action lies in his true nature and we ourselves compelled even to the teeth and forehead of our faults to give in evidence what then what rests try what repentance can what can it not yet what can it when one cannot repent o wretched state o bosom black as death o lim\u00e8d soul that struggling to be free art more engaged help angels make assay bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel be soft as sinews of the newborn babe all may be well my words fly up my thoughts remain below words without thoughts never to heaven go there's matter in these sighs these profound heaves you must translate 'tis fit we understand them where is your son what gertrude how does hamlet o heavy deed it had been so with us had we been there his liberty is full of threats to all  to you yourself to us to everyone alas how shall this bloody deed be answered it will be laid to us whose providence should have kept short restrained and out of haunt this mad young man but so much was our love we would not understand what was most fit but like the owner of a foul disease to keep it from divulging let it feed even on the pith of life where is he gone o gertrude come away the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch but we will ship him hence and this vile deed we must with all our majesty and skill both countenance and excuse ho guildenstern friends both go join you with some further aid hamlet in madness hath polonius slain and from his mother's closet hath he dragged him go seek him out speak fair and bring the body into the chapel i pray you haste in this come gertrude we'll call up our wisest friends and let them know both what we mean to do and what's untimely done whose whisper o'er the world's diameter as level as the cannon to his blank transports his poisoned shot may miss our name and hit the woundless air o come away my soul is full of discord and dismay i have sent to seek him and to find the body how dangerous is it that this man goes loose yet must not we put the strong law on him he's loved of the distracted multitude who like not in their judgment but their eyes and where 'tis so th' offender's scourge is weighed but never the offense to bear all smooth and even this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate pause diseases desperate grown by desperate appliance are relieved or not at all how now what hath befallen but where is he bring him before us now hamlet where's polonius at supper where alas alas what dost thou mean by this where is polonius go seek him there hamlet this deed for thine especial safety which we do tender as we dearly grieve for that which thou hast done must send thee hence with fiery quickness therefore prepare thyself the bark is ready and the wind at help th' associates tend and everything is bent for england ay hamlet so is it if thou knew'st our purposes thy loving father hamlet follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard delay it not i'll have him hence tonight away for everything is sealed and done that else leans on th' affair pray you make haste and england if my love thou hold'st at aught as my great power thereof may give thee sense since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red after the danish sword and thy free awe pays homage to us thou mayst not coldly set our sovereign process which imports at full by letters congruing to that effect the present death of hamlet do it england for like the hectic in my blood he rages and thou must cure me till i know 'tis done howe'er my haps my joys will ne'er begin how do you pretty lady conceit upon her father pretty ophelia  how long hath she been thus follow her close give her good watch i pray you o this is the poison of deep grief it springs all from her father's death and now behold o gertrude gertrude when sorrows come they come not single spies but in battalions first her father slain next your son gone and he most violent author of his own just remove the people muddied thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers for good polonius' death and we have done but greenly in hugger mugger to inter him poor ophelia divided from herself and her fair judgment without the which we are pictures or mere beasts last and as much containing as all these her brother is in secret come from france feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds and wants not buzzers to infect his ear with pestilent speeches of his father's death wherein necessity of matter beggared will nothing stick our person to arraign in ear and ear o my dear gertrude this like to a murd'ring piece in many places gives me superfluous death attend where is my switzers let them guard the door what is the matter the doors are broke what is the cause laertes that thy rebellion looks so giant like  let him go gertrude do not fear our person there's such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would acts little of his will tell me laertes why thou art thus incensed let him go gertrude  speak man dead let him demand his fill who shall stay you good laertes if you desire to know the certainty of your dear father is 't writ in your revenge that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe winner and loser will you know them then why now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman that i am guiltless of your father's death and am most sensibly in grief for it it shall as level to your judgment 'pear as day does to your eye laertes i must commune with your grief or you deny me right go but apart make choice of whom your wisest friends you will and they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me if by direct or by collateral hand they find us touched we will our kingdom give our crown our life and all that we call ours to you in satisfaction but if not be you content to lend your patience to us and we shall jointly labor with your soul to give it due content so you shall and where th' offense is let the great ax fall i pray you go with me now must your conscience my acquittance seal and you must put me in your heart for friend sith you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed but yet to me they're strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which she is so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection work like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timbered for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again but not where i have aimed them break not your sleeps for that you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more i loved your father and we love ourself and that i hope will teach you to imagine  how now what news from hamlet who brought them laertes you shall hear them  leave us high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom tomorrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return hamlet what should this mean are all the rest come back or is it some abuse and no such thing 'tis hamlet's character naked  and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise me if it be so laertes as how should it be so how otherwise will you be ruled by me to thine own peace if he be now returned as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to an exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practice and call it accident it falls right you have been talked of since your travel much and that in hamlet's hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege a very ribbon in the cap of youth  yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy i have seen myself and served against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft in 't he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as had he been encorpsed and demi natured with the brave beast so far he topped my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did a norman the very same he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defense and for your rapier most especial that he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the 'scrimers of their nation he swore had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposed them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming o'er to play with you now out of this  laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a pleurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick of th' ulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself indeed your father's son more than in words no place indeed should murder sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber hamlet returned shall know you are come home we'll put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practice requite him for your father let's further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance 'twere better not assayed therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this did blast in proof soft let me see we'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings  i ha 't when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink i'll have prepared him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping if he by chance escape your venomed stuck our purpose may hold there but stay what noise let's follow gertrude how much i had to do to calm his rage now fear i this will give it start again therefore let's follow pluck them asunder o he is mad laertes i pray thee good horatio wait upon him strengthen your patience in our last night's speech we'll put the matter to the present push  good gertrude set some watch over your son  this grave shall have a living monument an hour of quiet thereby shall we see till then in patience our proceeding be come hamlet come and take this hand from me give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet you know the wager i do not fear it i have seen you both but since he is better we have therefore odds set me the stoups of wine upon that table  if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmark's crown have worn give me the cups and let the kettle to the trumpet speak the trumpet to the cannoneer without the cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth now the king drinks to hamlet come begin and you the judges bear a wary eye stay give me drink hamlet this pearl is thine here's to thy health give him the cup our son shall win gertrude do not drink it is the poisoned cup it is too late i do not think 't part them they are

return to plague th' inventor this even handed justice commends th' ingredience of our poisoned chalice to our own lips he's here in double trust first as i am his kinsman and his subject strong both against the deed then as his host who should against his murderer shut the door not bear the knife myself besides this duncan hath borne his faculties so meek hath been so clear in his great office that his virtues will plead like angels trumpet tongued against the deep damnation of his taking off and pity like a naked newborn babe striding the blast or heaven's cherubin horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air shall blow the horrid deed in every eye that tears shall drown the wind i have no spur to prick the sides of my intent but only vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself and falls on th' other  how now what news hath he asked for me we will proceed no further in this business he hath honored me of late and i have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people which would be worn now in their newest gloss not cast aside so soon prithee peace i dare do all that may become a man who dares do more is none if we should fail  bring forth men children only for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males will it not be received when we have marked with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers that they have done 't i am settled and bend up each corporal agent to this terrible feat away and mock the time with fairest show false face must hide what the false heart doth know a friend being unprepared our will became the servant to defect which else should free have wrought i think not of them yet when we can entreat an hour to serve we would spend it in some words upon that business if you would grant the time if you

before me the handle toward my hand come let me clutch thee i have thee not and yet i see thee still art thou not fatal vision sensible to feeling as to sight or art thou but a dagger of the mind a false creation proceeding from the heat oppress\u00e8d brain i see thee yet in form as palpable as this which now i draw thou marshal'st me the way that i was going and such an instrument i was to use mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses or else worth all the rest i see thee still and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood which was not so before there's no such thing it is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes now o'er the one half world nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse the curtained sleep witchcraft celebrates pale hecate's off'rings and withered murder alarumed by his sentinel the wolf whose howl's his watch thus with his stealthy pace with tarquin's ravishing strides towards his design moves like a ghost thou sure and firm set earth hear not my steps which way they walk for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabouts and take the present horror from the time which now suits with it whiles i threat he lives words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives i go and it is done the bell invites me hear it not duncan for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell who's there what ho i have done the deed didst thou not hear a noise when as i descended hark who lies i' th' second chamber this is a sorry sight there's one did laugh in 's sleep and one cried murder that they did wake each other i stood and heard them but they did say their prayers and addressed them again to sleep one cried god bless us and amen the other as they had seen me with these hangman's hands list'ning their fear i could not say amen when they did say god bless us but wherefore could not i pronounce amen i had most need of blessing and amen stuck in my throat methought i heard a voice cry sleep no more macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care the death of each day's life sore labor's bath balm of hurt minds great nature's second course chief nourisher in life's feast still it cried sleep

not whence is that knocking how is 't with me when every noise appalls me what hands are here ha they pluck out mine eyes will all great neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand no this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine making the green one red to know my deed 'twere best not know myself wake duncan with thy knocking i would thou couldst good morrow both not yet i'll bring you to him the labor we delight in physics pain this is the door he does he did appoint so 'twas a rough night what's the matter what is 't you say the life had i but died an hour before this chance i had lived a bless\u00e8d time for from this instant there's nothing serious in mortality all is but toys renown and grace is dead the wine of life is drawn and the mere lees is left this vault to brag of you are and do not know 't the spring the head the fountain of your blood is stopped the very source of it is stopped o yet i do repent me of my fury that i did kill them who can be wise amazed temp'rate and furious loyal and neutral in a moment no man th' expedition of my violent love outrun the pauser reason here lay duncan his silver skin laced with his golden blood and his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature for ruin's wasteful entrance there the murderers steeped in the colors of their trade their daggers unmannerly breeched with gore who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make 's love known so all let's briefly put on manly readiness and meet i' th' hall together here's our chief guest tonight we hold a solemn supper sir and i'll request your presence ride you this afternoon we should have else desired your good advice which still hath been both grave and prosperous in this day's council but we'll take tomorrow is 't far you ride fail not our feast we hear our bloody cousins are bestowed in england and in ireland not confessing their cruel parricide filling their hearers with strange invention but of that tomorrow when therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly hie you to horse adieu till you return at night goes fleance with you i wish your horses swift and sure of foot and so i do commend you to their backs farewell let every man be master of his time till seven at night to make society the sweeter welcome we will keep ourself till suppertime alone while then god be with you sirrah a word with you attend those men our pleasure bring them before us to be thus is nothing but to be safely thus our fears in banquo stick deep and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be feared 'tis much he dares and to that dauntless temper of his mind he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor to act in safety there is none but he whose being i do fear and under him my genius is rebuked as it is said mark antony's was by caesar he chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me and bade them speak to him then prophet like they hailed him father to a line of kings upon my head they placed a fruitless crown and put a barren scepter in my grip thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand no son of mine succeeding if 't be so for banquo's issue have i filed my mind for them the gracious duncan have i murdered put rancors in the vessel of my peace only for them and mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man to make them kings the seeds of banquo kings rather than so come fate into the list and champion me to th' utterance who's there now go to the door and stay there till we call was it not yesterday we spoke together well then now have you considered of my speeches know that it was he in the times past which held you so under fortune which you thought had been our innocent self this i made good to you in our last conference passed in probation with you how you were borne in hand how crossed the instruments who wrought with them and all things else that might to half a soul and to a notion crazed say thus did banquo i did so and went further which is now our point of second meeting do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go are you so gospeled to pray for this good man and for his issue whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave and beggared yours forever ay in the catalogue you go for men as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs shoughs water rugs and demi wolves are clept all by the name of dogs the valued file distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle the housekeeper the hunter every one according to the gift which bounteous nature hath in him closed whereby he does receive particular addition from the bill that writes them all alike and so of men now if you have a station in the file not i' th' worst rank of manhood say 't and i will put that business in your bosoms whose execution takes your enemy off grapples you to the heart and love of us who wear our health but sickly in his life which in his death were perfect both of you know banquo was your enemy so is he mine and in such bloody distance that every minute of his being thrusts against my near'st of life and though i could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it yet i must not for certain friends that are both his and mine whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall who i myself struck down and thence it is that i to your assistance do make love masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons your spirits shine through you within this hour at most i will advise you where to plant yourselves acquaint you with the perfect spy o' th' time the moment on 't for 't must be done tonight and something from the palace always thought that i require a clearness and with him to leave no rubs nor botches in the work fleance his son that keeps him company whose absence is no less material to me than is his father's must embrace the fate of that dark hour resolve yourselves apart i'll come to you anon i'll call upon you straight abide within it is concluded banquo thy soul's flight if it find heaven must find it out tonight we have scorched the snake not killed it she'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth but let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly better be with the dead whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy duncan is in his grave after life's fitful fever he sleeps well treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison malice domestic foreign levy nothing can touch him further so shall i love and so i pray be you let your remembrance apply to banquo present him eminence both with eye and tongue unsafe the while that we must lave our honors in these flattering streams and make our faces vizards to our hearts disguising what they are o full of scorpions is my mind dear wife thou know'st that banquo and his fleance lives there's comfort yet they are assailable then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown his cloistered flight ere to black hecate's summons the shard born beetle with his drowsy hums hath rung night's yawning peal there shall be done a deed of dreadful note be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck till thou applaud the deed come seeling night scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day and with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale light thickens and the crow makes wing to th' rooky wood good things of day begin to droop and drowse whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse  thou marvel'st at my words but hold thee still things bad begun make strong themselves by ill so prithee go with me you know your own degrees sit down at first and last the hearty welcome ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host our hostess keeps her state but in best time we will require her welcome see they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks both sides are even here i'll sit i' th' midst be large in mirth anon we'll drink a measure the table round there's blood upon thy face 'tis better thee without than he within is he dispatched thou art the best o' th' cutthroats yet he's good that did the like for fleance if thou didst it thou art the nonpareil then comes my fit again i had else been perfect whole as the marble founded as the rock as broad and general as the casing air but now i am cabined cribbed confined bound in to saucy doubts and fears but banquo's safe thanks for that there the grown serpent lies the worm that's fled hath nature that in time will venom breed no teeth for th' present get thee gone tomorrow we'll hear ourselves again sweet remembrancer  now good digestion wait on appetite and health on both here had we now our country's honor roofed were the graced person of our banquo present who may i rather challenge for unkindness than pity for mischance the table's full where which of you have done this thou canst not say i did it never shake thy gory locks at me ay and a bold one that dare look on that which might appall the devil prithee see there behold look lo how say you why what care i if thou canst nod speak too  if charnel houses and our graves must send those that we bury back our monuments shall be the maws of kites if i stand here i saw him blood hath been shed ere now i' th' olden time ere humane statute purged the gentle weal ay and since too murders have been performed too terrible for the ear the time has been that when the brains were out the man would die and there an end but now they rise again with twenty mortal murders on their crowns and push us from our stools this is more strange than such a murder is i do forget  do not muse at me my most worthy friends i have a strange infirmity which is nothing to those that know me come love and health to all then i'll sit down give me some wine fill full i drink to th' general joy o' th' whole table and to our dear friend banquo whom we miss would he were here to all and him we thirst and all to all avaunt and quit my sight let the earth hide thee thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with what man dare i dare approach thou like the rugged russian bear the armed rhinoceros or th' hyrcan tiger take any shape but that and my firm nerves shall never tremble or be alive again and dare me to the desert with thy sword if trembling i inhabit then protest me the baby of a girl hence horrible shadow unreal mock'ry hence why so being gone i am a man again pray you sit still can such things be and overcome us like a summer's cloud without our special wonder you make me strange even to the disposition that i owe when now i think you can behold such sights and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks when mine is blanched with fear it will have blood they say blood will have blood stones

'em let me see 'em tell me thou unknown power  whate'er thou art for thy good caution thanks thou hast harped my fear aright but one word more  had i three ears i'd hear thee then live macduff what

like the issue of a king and wears upon his baby brow the round and top of sovereignty that will never be who can impress the forest bid the tree unfix his earthbound root sweet bodements good rebellious dead rise never till the wood of birnam rise and our high placed macbeth shall live the lease of nature pay his breath to time and mortal custom yet my heart throbs to know one thing tell me if your art can tell so much shall banquo's issue ever reign in this kingdom i will be satisfied deny me this and an eternal curse fall on you let me know why sinks that cauldron and what noise is this thou art too like the spirit of banquo down thy crown does sear mine eyeballs and thy hair thou other gold bound brow is like the first a third is like the former filthy hags why do you show me

that twofold balls and treble scepters carry horrible sight now i see 'tis true for the blood boltered banquo smiles upon me and points at them for his what is this so where are they gone let this pernicious hour stand aye accurs\u00e8d in the calendar  come in without there saw you the we\u00efrd sisters came they not by you infected be the air whereon they ride and damned all those that trust

whose time boys went to span counter for french crowns i am content he shall reign but i'll be protector over him and good reason for thereby is england mained and fain to go with a staff but that my puissance holds it up fellow kings i tell you that that lord saye hath gelded the commonwealth and made it an eunuch and more than that he can speak french and therefore he is a traitor nay answer if you can the frenchmen are our enemies go to then i ask but this can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good counselor or no and you that love the commons follow me now show yourselves men

hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school and whereas before our forefathers had no other books but the score and the tally thou hast caused printing to be

words as no christian ear can endure to hear thou hast appointed justices of peace to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer moreover thou hast put them in prison and because they could not read thou hast hanged them when indeed only for that cause they have been most worthy to live thou dost ride on a footcloth dost thou not marry thou oughtst not to let thy horse

them kiss one another for they loved well when they were alive now part them again lest they consult about the giving up of some more towns in france soldiers defer the spoil of the city until night

a sallet another while which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach this hot weather and i think this word sallet was born to do me good for many a time but for a sallet my brainpan had been cleft with a brown bill and many a time when i have been dry and bravely marching it hath served me instead of a quart pot to drink in and now the word sallet must serve me to feed on here's the lord of the soil

breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value worthy cogitations tell me good brutus can you see your face 'tis just and it is very much lamented brutus that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow i have heard where many of the best respect in rome except immortal caesar speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this age's yoke have wished that noble brutus had his eyes therefore good brutus be prepared to hear and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection i your glass will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of and be not jealous on me gentle brutus were i a common laughter or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout then hold me dangerous ay do you fear it then must i think you would not have it so i know that virtue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward favor well honor is the subject of my story i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life but for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winter's cold as well as he for once upon a raw and gusty day the troubled tiber chafing with her shores caesar said to me dar'st thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point upon the word accoutered as i was i plung\u00e8d in and bade him follow so indeed he did the torrent roared and we did buffet it with lusty sinews throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy but ere we could arrive the point proposed caesar cried help me cassius or i sink i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake 'tis true this god did shake his coward lips did from their color fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his luster i did hear him groan ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books alas it cried give me some drink titinius as a sick girl you gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves men at some time are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar why should that name be sounded more than yours write them together yours is as fair a name sound them it doth become the mouth as well weigh them it is as heavy conjure with 'em brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar now in the names of all the gods at once upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great age thou art shamed rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods when went there by an age since the great flood but it was famed with more than with one man when could they say till now that talked of rome that her wide walks encompassed but one man now is it rome indeed and room enough when there is in it but one only man o you and i have heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would have brooked th' eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve and he will after his sour fashion tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today casca will tell us what the matter is they shouted thrice what was the last cry for who offered him the crown but soft i pray you what did caesar swoon no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the falling sickness did cicero say anything to what effect will you sup with me tonight casca will you dine with me tomorrow good i will expect you so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite i will do so till then think of the world well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honorable mettle may be wrought from that it is disposed therefore it is meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes for who so firm that cannot be seduced caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humor me i will this night in several hands in at his windows throw as if they came from several citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesar's ambition shall be glanc\u00e8d at and after this let caesar seat him sure for we will shake him or worse days endure who's there casca by your voice a very pleasing night to honest men those that have known the earth so full of faults for my part i have walked about the streets submitting me unto the perilous night and thus unbrac\u00e8d casca as you see have bared my bosom to the thunder stone and when the cross blue lightning seemed to open the breast of heaven i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it you are dull casca and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want or else you use not you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from quality and kind why old men fools and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and preform\u00e8d faculties to monstrous quality why you shall find that heaven hath infused them with these spirits to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunders lightens opens graves and roars as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruptions are let it be who it is for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors but woe the while our fathers' minds are dead and we are governed with our mothers' spirits our yoke and sufferance show us womanish i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein you gods you make the weak most strong therein you gods you tyrants do defeat nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure and why should caesar be a tyrant then poor man i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep he were no lion were not romans hinds those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar but o grief where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made but i am armed and dangers are to me indifferent there's a bargain made now know you casca i have moved already some certain of the noblest minded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honorable dangerous consequence and i do know by this they stay for me in pompey's porch for now this fearful night there is no stir or walking in the streets and the complexion of the element in favor 's like the work we have in hand most bloody fiery and most terrible 'tis cinna i do know him by his gait he is a friend cinna where haste you so no it is casca one incorporate to our attempts am i not stayed for cinna am i not stayed for tell me be you content good cinna take this paper and look you lay it in the praetor's chair where brutus may but find it and throw this in at his window set this up with wax upon old brutus' statue all this done repair to pompey's porch where you shall find us is decius brutus and trebonius there that done repair to pompey's theater come casca you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house three parts of him is ours already and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited let us go for it is after midnight and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him i think we are too bold upon your rest good morrow brutus do we trouble you yes every man of them and no man here but honors you and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you this is trebonius this decius brutus this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber shall i entreat a word and let us swear our resolution but what of cicero shall we sound him i think he will stand very strong with us then leave him out decius well urged i think it is not meet mark antony so well beloved of caesar should outlive caesar we shall find of him a shrewd contriver and you know his means if he improve them may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent let antony and caesar fall together yet i fear him for in the engrafted love he bears to caesar  the clock hath stricken three but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth today or no for he is superstitious grown of late quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies it may be these apparent prodigies the unaccustomed terror of this night and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitol today nay we will all of us be there to fetch him the morning comes upon 's we'll leave you brutus and friends disperse yourselves but all remember what you have said and show yourselves true romans what urge you your petitions in the street come to the capitol what enterprise popilius he wished today our enterprise might thrive i fear our purpose is discover\u00e8d casca be sudden for we fear prevention  brutus what shall be done if this be known cassius or caesar never shall turn back for i will slay myself trebonius knows his time for look you brutus he draws mark antony out of the way pardon caesar caesar pardon as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber some to the common pulpits and cry out liberty freedom and enfranchisement and leave us publius lest that the people rushing on us should do your age some mischief where is antony stoop then and wash how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown so oft as that shall be so often shall the knot of us be called the men that gave their country liberty ay every man away brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome i wish we may but yet have i a mind that fears him much and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose your voice shall be as strong as any man's in the disposing of new dignities mark antony  i blame you not for praising caesar so but what compact mean you to have with us will you be pricked in number of our friends or shall we on and not depend on you brutus a word with you you know not what you do do not consent that antony speak in his funeral know you how much the people may be moved by that which he will utter i know not what may fall i like it not stand ho most noble brother you have done me wrong brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs and when you do them  pindarus bid our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground that you have wronged me doth appear in this you have condemned and noted lucius pella for taking bribes here of the sardians wherein my letters praying on his side because i knew the man was slighted off in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offense should bear his comment i an itching palm you know that you are brutus that speaks this or by the gods this speech were else your last chastisement brutus bait not me i'll not endure it you forget yourself to hedge me in i am a soldier i older in practice abler than yourself to make conditions i am urge me no more i shall forget myself have mind upon your health tempt me no farther is 't possible o you gods you gods must i endure all this is it come to this you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus i said an elder soldier not a better did i say better when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me i durst not what durst not tempt him do not presume too much upon my love i may do that i shall be sorry for i denied you not i did not he was but a fool that brought my answer back brutus hath rived my heart a friend should bear his friend's infirmities but brutus makes mine greater than they are you love me not a friendly eye could never see such faults come antony and young octavius come revenge yourselves alone on cassius for cassius is aweary of the world  hated by one he loves braved by his brother checked like a bondman all his faults observed set in a notebook learned and conned by rote to cast into my teeth o i could weep my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger and here my naked breast within a heart dearer than pluto's mine richer than gold if that thou be'st a roman take it forth i that denied thee gold will give my heart strike as thou didst at caesar for i know when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius hath cassius lived to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus when grief and blood ill tempered vexeth him do you confess so much give me your hand o brutus have not you love enough to bear with me when that rash humor which my mother gave me makes me forgetful how now what's the matter ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme bear with him brutus 'tis his fashion away away be gone and come yourselves and bring messala with you immediately to us i did not think you could have been so angry of your philosophy you make no use if you give place to accidental evils ha portia how 'scaped i killing when i crossed you so o insupportable and touching loss upon what sickness and died so o you immortal gods my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge  fill lucius till the wine o'erswell the cup i cannot drink too much of brutus' love portia art thou gone cicero one i have as much of this in art as you but yet my nature could not bear it so i do not think it good this it is 'tis better that the enemy seek us so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers doing himself offense whilst we lying still are full of rest defense and nimbleness hear me good brother  then with your will go on we'll along ourselves and meet them at philippi no more good night early tomorrow will we rise and hence o my dear brother this was an ill beginning of the night never come such division 'tween our souls let it not brutus good night my lord stand fast titinius we must out and talk antony the posture of your blows are yet unknown but for your words they rob the hybla bees and leave them honeyless flatterers now brutus thank yourself this tongue had not offended so today if cassius might have ruled a peevish schoolboy worthless of such honor joined with a masker and a reveler why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark the storm is up and all is on the hazard messala messala this is my birthday as this very day was cassius born give me thy hand messala be thou my witness that against my will as pompey was am i compelled to set upon one battle all our liberties you know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion now i change my mind and partly credit things that do presage coming from sardis on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell and there they perched gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands who to philippi here consorted us this morning are they fled away and gone and in their steads do ravens crows and kites fly o'er our heads and downward look on us as we were sickly prey their shadows seem a canopy most fatal under which our army lies ready to give up the ghost i but believe it partly for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly now most noble brutus the gods today stand friendly that we may lovers in peace lead on our days to age but since the affairs of men rests still incertain let's reason with the worst that may befall if we do lose this battle then is this the very last time we shall speak together what are you then determin\u00e8d to do then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome forever and forever farewell brutus if we do meet again we'll smile indeed if not 'tis true this parting was well made o look titinius look the villains fly myself have to mine own turned enemy this ensign here of mine was turning back i slew the coward and did take it from him this hill is far enough look look titinius are those my tents where i perceive the fire titinius if thou lovest me mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again that i may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy go pindarus get higher on that hill my sight was ever thick regard titinius and tell me what thou not'st about the field this day i breath\u00e8d first time is come round and where i did begin there shall i end my life is run his compass sirrah what news what news come down behold no more  o coward that i am to live so long to see my best friend ta'en before my face come hither sirrah in parthia did i take thee prisoner and then i swore thee saving of thy life that whatsoever i did bid thee do thou shouldst attempt it come now keep thine oath now be a freeman and with this good sword that ran through caesar's bowels search this bosom stand not to

down he rescued me and said dear brother live and be a king who told me when we both lay in the field frozen almost to death how he did lap me even in his garments and did give himself all thin and

captivity hail brave friend say to the king the knowledge of the broil as thou didst leave it the worthy thane of ross my liege they are not yet come back but i have spoke with one that saw him die who did report that very frankly he confessed his treasons implored your highness' pardon and set forth a deep repentance nothing in his life became him like the leaving it he died as one that had been studied in his death to throw away the dearest thing he owed as 'twere a careless trifle o by whom why do we hold our tongues that most may claim this argument for ours nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion so all well contented what will you do let's not consort with them to show an unfelt sorrow is an office which the false man does easy i'll to england this murderous shaft that's shot hath not yet lighted and our safest way is to avoid the aim therefore to horse and let us not be dainty of leave taking but shift away there's warrant in that theft which steals itself when

you go with me even to the next willow about your own business county what fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck like an usurer's chain or under your arm like a lieutenant's scarf you must wear it one way for the prince hath got your hero why that's spoken like an honest drover so they sell bullocks but did you think the prince would have served you thus ho now you strike like the blind man 'twas the boy that stole your meat and you'll beat the post alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges but that my lady beatrice should know me and not know me the prince's fool ha it may be i go under that title because i am merry yea but so i am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out well i'll be revenged as i may troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren i told him and i think i told him true that your grace had got the goodwill of this young lady and i offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped the flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyed with finding a bird's nest shows it his companion and he steals it yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as i take it have stolen his bird's nest if their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly o she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her she told me not thinking i had been myself that i was the prince's jester that i was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me she speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star i would not marry her though she were endowed with all that adam had left him before he transgressed she would have made hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal ate in good apparel i would to god some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follows her will your grace command me any service to the world's end i will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on i will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of asia bring you the length of prester john's foot fetch you a hair off the great cham's beard do you any embassage to the pygmies rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy you have no employment for me o god sir here's a dish i love not i cannot endure my lady tongue boy in my chamber window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard i know that but i would have thee hence and here again i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is claudio i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes may i be so converted and see with these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but i'll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich she shall be that's certain wise or i'll none virtuous or i'll never cheapen her fair or i'll never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not i for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what color it please god ha the prince and monsieur love i will hide me in the arbor now divine air now is his soul ravished is it not strange that sheeps' guts

would be so vile esteemed in fine redeemed i was as i desired but o the treacherous fastolf wounds my heart whom with my bare fists i would execute if i now had him brought into my power with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts in open marketplace produced they me to be a public spectacle to all here said they is the terror of the french the scarecrow that affrights our children so then broke i from the officers that led me and with my nails digged stones out of the ground to hurl at the beholders of my shame my grisly countenance made others fly none durst come near for fear of sudden death in iron walls they deemed me not secure so great fear of my name 'mongst them were spread that they supposed i could rend bars of steel and spurn in pieces posts of adamant wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had that walked about me every minute while and if i did but stir out of my bed ready they were to shoot me to the heart for aught i see this city must be famished or with light

of artois walloon and picardy are friends to us this happy night the frenchmen are secure having all day caroused and banqueted embrace we then this opportunity as fitting best to quittance their deceit contrived by art and baleful sorcery a maid they say well let them practice and converse with spirits god is our fortress in whose conquering name let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks not all together better far i guess that we do make our entrance several ways that if it chance the one of us do fail the other yet may rise against their force and here will talbot mount or make his grave now salisbury for thee and for the right of english henry shall this night appear how much in duty i am bound to both bring forth the body of old salisbury and here advance it in the marketplace the middle center of this curs\u00e8d town now have i paid my vow unto his soul for every drop of blood was drawn from him there hath at least five frenchmen died tonight and that hereafter ages may behold what ruin happened in revenge of him within their chiefest temple i'll erect a tomb wherein his corpse shall be interred upon the which that everyone may read shall be engraved the sack of orleance the treacherous manner of his mournful death and what a terror he had been to france but lords in all our bloody massacre i muse we met not with the dauphin's grace his new come champion virtuous joan of arc nor any of his false confederates here is the talbot who would speak with him ne'er trust me then for when a world of men could not prevail with all their oratory yet hath a woman's kindness overruled  and therefore tell her i return great thanks and in submission will attend on her  will not your honors bear me company well then alone since there's no remedy i mean to prove this lady's courtesy  come hither captain you perceive my mind madam i have been bold to trouble you but since your ladyship is not at leisure i'll sort some other time to visit you marry for that she's in a wrong belief i go to certify her talbot's here prisoner to whom ha ha ha i laugh to see your ladyship so fond to think that you have aught but talbot's shadow whereon to practice your severity i am indeed no no i am but shadow of myself you are deceived my substance is not here for what you see is but the smallest part and least proportion of humanity i tell you madam were the whole frame here it is of such a spacious lofty pitch your roof were not sufficient to contain 't that will i show you presently how say you madam are you now persuaded that talbot is but shadow of himself these are his substance sinews arms and strength with which he yoketh your rebellious necks razeth your cities and subverts your towns and in a moment makes them desolate be not dismayed fair lady nor misconster the mind of talbot as you did mistake the outward composition of his body what you have done hath not offended me nor other satisfaction do i crave but only with your patience that we may taste of your wine and see what cates you have for soldiers' stomachs always serve them well france thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears if talbot but survive thy treachery pucelle that witch that damn\u00e8d sorceress hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares that hardly we escaped the pride of france foul fiend of france and hag of all despite encompassed with thy lustful paramours becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age and twit with cowardice a man half dead damsel i'll have a bout with you again or else let talbot perish with this shame dare you come forth and meet us in the field i speak not to that railing hecate but unto thee alanson and the rest will you like soldiers come and fight it out seigneur hang base muleteers of france like peasant footboys do they keep the walls and dare not take up arms like gentlemen and there will we be too ere it be long or else reproach be talbot's greatest fame  vow burgundy by honor of thy house pricked on by public wrongs sustained in france either to get the town again or die and i as sure as english henry lives and as his father here was conqueror as sure as in this late betray\u00e8d town great coeur de lion's heart was buri\u00e8d so sure i swear to get the town or die but ere we go regard this dying prince the valiant duke of bedford come my lord we will bestow you in some better place fitter for sickness and for crazy age undaunted spirit in a dying breast then be it so heavens keep old bedford safe  and now no more ado brave burgundy but gather we our forces out of hand and set upon our boasting enemy lost and recovered in a day again this is a double honor burgundy yet heavens have glory for this victory thanks gentle duke but where is pucelle now i think her old familiar is asleep now where's the bastard's braves and charles his gleeks what all amort roan hangs her head for grief that such a valiant company are fled now will we take some order in the town placing therein some expert officers and then depart to paris to the king for there young henry with his nobles lie but yet before we go let's not forget the noble duke of bedford late deceased but see his exequies fulfilled in roan a braver soldier never couch\u00e8d lance a gentler heart did never sway in court but kings and mightiest potentates must die for that's the end of human misery my gracious prince and honorable peers hearing of your arrival in this realm i have awhile given truce unto my wars to do my duty to my sovereign in sign whereof this arm that hath reclaimed to your obedience fifty fortresses twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength besides five hundred prisoners of esteem lets fall his sword before your highness' feet and with submissive loyalty of heart ascribes the glory of his conquest got first to my god and next unto your grace shame to the duke of burgundy and thee i vowed base knight when i did meet thee next to tear the garter from thy craven's leg which i have done because unworthily thou wast install\u00e8d in that high degree  pardon me princely henry and the rest this dastard at the battle of patay when but in all i was six thousand strong and that the french were almost ten to one before we met or that a stroke was given like to a trusty squire did run away in which assault we lost twelve hundred men myself and divers gentlemen besides were there surprised and taken prisoners then judge great lords if i have done amiss or whether that such cowards ought to wear this ornament of knighthood yea or no when first this order was ordained my lords knights of the garter were of noble birth valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage such as were grown to credit by the wars not fearing death nor shrinking for distress but always resolute in most extremes he then that is not furnished in this sort doth but usurp the sacred name of knight profaning this most honorable order and should if i were worthy to be judge be quite degraded like a hedge born swain that doth presume to boast of gentle blood content my liege yes but that i am prevented i should have begged i might have been employed i go my lord in heart desiring still you may behold confusion of your foes go to the gates of bordeaux trumpeter summon their general unto the wall english john talbot captains calls you forth servant in arms to harry king of england and thus he would open your city gates be humble to us call my sovereign yours and do him homage as obedient subjects and i'll withdraw me and my bloody power but if you frown upon this proffered peace you tempt the fury of my three attendants lean famine quartering steel and climbing fire who in a moment even with the earth shall lay your stately and air braving towers if you forsake the offer of their love

breath i gave thee life and rescued thee from death when from the dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire it warmed thy father's heart with proud desire of bold faced victory then leaden age quickened with youthful spleen and warlike rage beat down alanson orleance burgundy and from the pride of gallia rescued thee the ireful bastard orleance that drew blood from thee my boy and had the maidenhood of thy first fight i soon encounter\u00e8d and interchanging blows i quickly shed some of his bastard blood and in disgrace bespoke him thus contaminated base and misbegotten blood i spill of thine

sword he brandished over me and like a hungry lion did commence rough deeds of rage and stern impatience but when my angry guardant stood alone tend'ring my ruin and assailed of none dizzy eyed fury and great rage of heart suddenly made him from my side to start into the clust'ring battle of the french and in that sea of blood my boy did drench his over mounting spirit and there died my icarus my blossom in his pride thou antic death which laugh'st us here to scorn anon from thy insulting tyranny coupled in bonds of perpetuity two talbots wing\u00e8d through the lither sky in thy despite shall

of much good news know you don antonio your countryman hath he not a son you know him well beshrew me sir but if he make this good he is as worthy for an empress' love as meet to be an emperor's counselor well sir this gentleman is come to me with commendation from great potentates and here he means to spend his time awhile i think 'tis no unwelcome news to you welcome him then according to his worth sylvia i speak to you and you sir thurio for valentine i need not cite him to it i will send him hither to you presently sir thurio give us leave i pray awhile we have some secrets to confer about now tell me proteus what's your will with me proteus i thank thee for thine honest care which to requite command me while i live this love of theirs myself have often seen haply when they have judged me fast asleep and oftentimes have purposed to forbid sir valentine her company and my court but fearing lest my jealous aim might err and so unworthily disgrace the man  a rashness that i ever yet have shunned  i gave him gentle looks thereby to find that which thyself hast now disclosed to me and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this knowing that tender youth is soon suggested i nightly lodge her in an upper tower the key whereof myself have ever kept and thence she cannot be conveyed away upon mine honor he shall never know that i had any light from thee of this sir valentine whither away so fast be they of much import nay then no matter stay with me awhile i am to break with thee of some affairs that touch me near wherein thou must be secret 'tis not unknown to thee that i have sought to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter no trust me she is peevish sullen froward proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty neither regarding that she is my child nor fearing me as if i were her father and may i say to thee this pride of hers upon advice hath drawn my love from her and where i thought the remnant of mine age should have been cherished by her childlike duty i now am full resolved to take a wife and turn her out to who will take her in then let her beauty be her wedding dower for me and my possessions she esteems not there is a lady in verona here whom i affect but she is nice and coy and nought esteems my ag\u00e8d eloquence now therefore would i have thee to my tutor  for long agone i have forgot to court besides the fashion of the time is changed  how and which way i may bestow myself to be regarded in her sun bright eye but she did scorn a present that i sent her but she i mean is promised by her friends unto a youthful gentleman of worth and kept severely from resort of men that no man hath access by day to her ay but the doors be locked and keys kept safe that no man hath recourse to her by night her chamber is aloft far from the ground and built so shelving that one cannot climb it without apparent hazard of his life now as thou art a gentleman of blood advise me where i may have such a ladder this very night for love is like a child that longs for everything that he can come by but hark thee i will go to her alone how shall i best convey the ladder thither a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn then let me see thy cloak i'll get me one of such another length how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak i pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me what letter is this same what's here to sylvia and here an engine fit for my proceeding i'll be so bold to break the seal for once my thoughts do harbor with my sylvia nightly and slaves they are to me that send them flying o could their master come and go as lightly himself would lodge where senseless they are lying my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them while i their king that thither them importune do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them because myself do want my servants' fortune i curse myself for they are sent by me that they should harbor where their lord should be what's here sylvia this night i will enfranchise thee 'tis so and here's the ladder for the purpose why pha\u00ebton for thou art merops' son  wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car and with thy daring folly burn the world wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee go base intruder overweening slave bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates and think my patience more than thy desert is privilege for thy departure hence thank me for this more than for all the favors which all too much i have bestowed on thee but if thou linger in my territories longer than swiftest expedition will give thee time to leave our royal court by heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love i ever bore my daughter or thyself begone i will not hear thy vain excuse but as thou lov'st thy life make speed from hence sir thurio fear not but that she will love you now valentine is banished from her sight this weak impress of love is as a figure trench\u00e8d in ice which with an hour's heat dissolves to water and doth lose his form a little time will melt her frozen thoughts and worthless valentine shall be forgot how now sir proteus is your countryman according to our proclamation gone my daughter takes his going grievously so i believe but thurio thinks not so proteus the good conceit i hold of thee for thou hast shown some sign of good desert makes me the better to confer with thee thou know'st how willingly i would effect the match between sir thurio and my daughter and also i think thou art not ignorant how she opposes her against my will ay and perversely she persevers so what might we do to make the girl forget the love of valentine and love sir thurio ay but she'll think that it is spoke in hate then you must undertake to slander him where your good word cannot advantage him your slander never can endamage him therefore the office is indifferent being entreated to it by your friend and proteus we dare trust you in this kind because we know on valentine's report you are already love's firm votary and cannot soon revolt and change your mind upon this warrant shall you have access where you with sylvia may confer at large  for she is lumpish heavy melancholy and for your friend's sake will be glad of you  where you may temper her by your persuasion to hate young valentine and love my friend ay much is the force of heaven bred poesy this discipline shows thou hast been in love about it gentlemen even now about it i will pardon you how now sir proteus how now thurio which of you saw eglamour of late saw you my daughter why then she's fled unto that peasant valentine and eglamour is in her company 'tis true for friar lawrence met them both as he in penance wandered through the forest him he knew well and guessed that it was she but being masked he was not sure of it besides she did intend confession at patrick's cell this even and there she was not these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence therefore i pray you stand not to discourse but mount you presently and meet with me upon the rising of the mountain foot that leads toward mantua whither they are fled dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me sir valentine the more degenerate and base art thou to make such means for her as thou hast done and

methinks you lose  father tear the crown from the usurper's head sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly brother though i be youngest give me leave about that which concerns your grace and us the crown of england father which is yours your right depends not on his life or death no god forbid your grace should be forsworn i'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak an oath is of no moment being not took before a true and lawful magistrate that hath authority over him that swears henry had none but did usurp the place then seeing 'twas he that made you to depose your oath my lord is vain and frivolous therefore to arms and father do but think how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown within whose circuit is elysium and all that poets feign of bliss and joy why do we linger thus i cannot rest until the white rose that i wear be dyed even in the lukewarm blood of henry's heart ay with five hundred father for a need a woman's general what should we fear i cannot joy until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become i saw him in the battle range about and watched him how he singled clifford forth methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompassed round with dogs who having pinched a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him so fared our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles it the prime of youth trimmed like a younker prancing to his love three glorious suns each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds but severed in a pale clear shining sky see see they join embrace and seem to kiss as if they vowed some league inviolable now are they but one lamp one light one sun in this the heaven figures some event nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it you love the breeder better than the male but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue say how he died for i will hear it all i cannot weep for all my body's moisture scarce serves to quench my furnace burning heart nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden for selfsame wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast and burns me up with flames that tears would quench to weep is to make less the depth of grief tears then for babes blows and revenge for me richard i bear thy name i'll venge thy death or die renown\u00e8d by attempting it nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say either that is thine or else thou wert not his great lord of warwick if we should recount our baleful news and at each word's deliverance stab poniards in our flesh till all were told the words would add more anguish than the wounds o valiant lord the duke of york is slain 'twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled oft have i heard his praises in pursuit but ne'er till now his scandal of retire i know it well lord warwick blame me not 'tis love i bear thy glories make me speak but in this troublous time what's to be done shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns numb'ring our ave marys with our beads or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms if for the last say ay and to it lords ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day that cries retire if warwick bid him stay then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds i come to pierce it or to give thee mine are you there butcher o i cannot speak 'twas you that killed young rutland was it not for god's sake lords give signal to the fight northumberland i hold thee reverently  break off the parley for scarce i can refrain the execution of my big swoll'n heart upon that clifford that cruel child killer ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland but ere sunset i'll make thee curse the deed then executioner unsheathe thy sword by him that made us all i am resolved that clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue whoever got thee there thy mother stands for well i wot thou hast thy mother's tongue iron of naples hid with english gilt whose father bears the title of a king as if a channel should be called the sea sham'st thou not knowing whence thou art extraught to let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk broached with the steely point of clifford's lance and in the very pangs of death he cried like to a dismal clangor heard from far warwick revenge brother revenge my death so underneath the belly of their steeds that stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood the noble gentleman gave up the ghost brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick let me embrace thee in my weary arms i that did never weep now melt with woe that winter should cut off our springtime so now clifford i have singled thee alone suppose this arm is for the duke of york and this for rutland both bound to revenge wert thou environed with a brazen wall nay warwick single out some other chase for i myself will hunt this wolf to death whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave a deadly groan like life and death's departing revoke that doom of mercy for 'tis clifford who not contented that he lopped the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth but set his murd'ring knife unto the root from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring i mean our princely father duke of york o would he did and so perhaps he doth 'tis but his policy to counterfeit because he would avoid such bitter taunts which in the time of death he gave our father clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace thou didst love york and i am son to york what not an oath nay then the world goes hard when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath i know by that he's dead and by my soul if this right hand would buy but two hours' life that i in all despite might rail at him this hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstaunch\u00e8d thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester for gloucester's dukedom is too ominous your highness shall do well to grant her suit it were dishonor to deny it her yea is it so i see the lady hath a thing to grant before the king will grant her humble suit silence ay widow then i'll warrant you all your lands an if what pleases him shall pleasure you fight closer or good faith you'll catch a blow god forbid that for he'll take vantages nay then whip me he'll rather give her two you shall have four if you'll be ruled by him ay good leave have you for you will have leave till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch he plies her hard and much rain wears the marble the match is made she seals it with a cursy the widow likes him not she knits her brows the ghostly father now hath done his shrift the widow likes it not for she looks very sad that would be ten days' wonder at the least by so much is the wonder in extremes ay edward will use women honorably would he were wasted marrow bones and all  that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for and yet between my soul's desire and me the lustful edward's title buri\u00e8d is clarence henry and his son young edward and all the unlooked for issue of their bodies to take their rooms ere i can place myself a cold premeditation for my purpose why then i do but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a far off shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying he'll lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say i'll cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities my eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford i'll make my heaven in a lady's lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and 'witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns why love forswore me in my mother's womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a withered shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlicked bear whelp that carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be beloved o monstrous fault to harbor such a thought then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to check to o'erbear such as are of better person than myself i'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live t' account this world but hell until my misshaped trunk that bears this head be round impal\u00e8d with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and i like one lost in a thorny wood that rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murder whiles i smile and cry content to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions i'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall i'll slay more gazers than the basilisk i'll play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slyly than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colors to the chameleon change shapes with proteus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this and cannot get a crown tut were it farther off i'll pluck it down now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice and his well chosen bride and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well not i no god forbid that i should wish them severed whom god hath joined together ay and 'twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonor\u00e8d by this new marriage and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood i hear yet say not much but think the more not i my thoughts aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown ay in despite of all that shall withstand you now my lord hastings and sir william stanley leave off to wonder why i drew you hither into this chiefest thicket of the park thus stands the case you know our king my brother is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands he hath good usage and great liberty and often but attended with weak guard comes hunting this way to disport himself i have advertised him by secret means that if about this hour he make this way under the color of his usual game he shall here find his friends with horse and men to set him free from his captivity brother the time and case requireth haste your horse stands ready at the park corner well guessed believe me for that was my meaning but wherefore stay we 'tis no time to talk come then away let's ha' no more ado the gates made fast brother i like not this for many men that stumble at the threshold are well foretold that danger lurks within but when the fox hath once got in his nose he'll soon find means to make the body follow a wise stout captain and soon persuaded brother this is sir john montgomery our trusty friend unless i be deceived why brother wherefore stand you on nice points and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns brother we will proclaim you out of hand the bruit thereof will bring you many friends long live edward the fourth away betimes before his forces join and take the great grown traitor unawares brave warriors march amain towards coventry see how the surly warwick mans the wall i thought at least he would have said the king or did he make the jest against his will ay by my faith for a poor earl to give i'll do thee service for so good a gift alas that warwick had no more forecast but whiles he thought to steal the single ten the king was slyly fingered from the deck you left poor henry at the bishop's palace and ten to one you'll meet him in the tower come warwick take the time kneel down kneel down nay when strike now or else the iron cools the gates are open let us enter too thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason even with the dearest blood your bodies bear two of thy name both dukes of somerset have sold their lives unto the house of york and thou shalt be the third if this sword hold welcome good clarence this is brother like the queen is valued thirty thousand strong and somerset with oxford fled to her if she have time to breathe be well assured her faction will be full as strong as ours it is and lo where youthful edward comes that you might still have worn the petticoat and ne'er have stol'n the breech from lancaster by heaven brat i'll plague you for that word for god's sake take away this captive scold sprawl'st thou take that to end thy agony marry and shall why should she live to fill the world with words clarence excuse me to the king my brother i'll hence to london on a serious matter ere you come there be sure to hear some news the tower the tower good day my lord what at your book so hard sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer suspicion always haunts the guilty mind the thief doth fear each bush an officer why what a peevish fool was that of crete that taught his son the office of a fowl and yet for all his wings the fool was drowned think'st thou i am an executioner thy son i killed for his presumption i'll hear no more die prophet in thy speech for this amongst the rest was i ordained what will the aspiring blood of lancaster sink in the ground i thought it would have mounted see how my sword weeps for the poor king's death o may such purple tears be always shed from those that wish the downfall of our house if any spark of life be yet remaining down down to hell and say i sent thee thither  i that have neither pity love nor fear indeed 'tis true that henry told me of for i have often heard my mother say i came into the world with my legs forward had i not reason think you to make haste and seek their ruin that usurped our right the midwife wondered and the women cried o jesus bless us he is born with teeth and so i was which plainly signified that i should snarl and bite and play the dog then since the heavens have shaped my body so let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it i have no brother i am like no brother and this word love which graybeards call divine be resident in men like one another and not in me i am myself alone clarence beware thou keep'st me from the light but i will sort a pitchy day for thee for i will buzz abroad such prophecies that edward shall be fearful of his life and then to purge his fear i'll be thy death king henry and the prince his son are gone clarence thy turn is next and then the rest counting myself but bad till i be best i'll throw thy body in another room and triumph henry in thy day of doom i'll blast his harvest if your head were laid for yet i am not looked on in the world this shoulder was ordained so thick to heave and heave it shall some weight or break my back work thou the way and that shalt execute and that i love the tree from whence thou sprang'st witness the loving

falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stayed he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turned he seemed to find his way without his eyes for out o' doors he went without their helps and to the last bended their light on me no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me madam i wish it may good my lord how does your honor for this

foughten field we kept together in our chivalry upon these words i came and cheered him up he smiled me in the face raught me his hand and with a feeble grip says dear my lord commend my service to my sovereign so did he turn and over suffolk's neck he threw his wounded arm and kissed his lips and so espoused to death with blood he sealed a testament of noble ending love the pretty and sweet manner

liege soldier you must come to the king charles duke of orl\u00e9ans nephew to the king john duke of bourbon and lord bouciqualt of other lords and barons knights and squires full fifteen hundred

h\u0153res franciae amen", "JC_Brutus": "a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march not i i am not gamesome i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony let me not hinder cassius your desires i'll leave you cassius be not deceived if i have veiled my look i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself vex\u00e8d i am of late with passions of some difference conceptions only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors but let not therefore my good friends be grieved among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutus with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men no cassius for the eye sees not itself but by reflection by some other things into what dangers would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me what means this shouting i do fear the people choose caesar for their king i would not cassius yet i love him well but wherefore do you hold me here so long what is it that you would impart to me if it be aught toward the general good set honor in one eye and death i' th' other and i will look on both indifferently for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honor more than i fear death another general shout i do believe that these applauses are for some new honors that are heaped on caesar that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further moved what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things till then my noble friend chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us the games are done and caesar is returning i will do so but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesar's brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calphurnia's cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being crossed in conference by some senators ay casca tell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad i should not then ask casca what had chanced what was the second noise for was the crown offered him thrice tell us the manner of it gentle casca 'tis very like he hath the falling sickness what said he when he came unto himself and after that he came thus sad away what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school and so it is for this time i will leave you tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you what lucius ho  i cannot by the progress of the stars give guess how near to day lucius i say  i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly  when lucius when awake i say what lucius get me a taper in my study lucius when it is lighted come and call me here it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general he would be crowned how that might change his nature there's the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking crown him that and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with th' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections swayed more than his reason but 'tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambition's ladder whereto the climber upward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpent's egg which hatched would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell get you to bed again it is not day is not tomorrow boy the ides of march look in the calendar and bring me word the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself shall rome etc speak strike redress brutus thou sleep'st awake such instigations have been often dropped where i have took them up shall rome etc thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one man's awe what rome my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was called a king speak strike redress am i entreated to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus 'tis good go to the gate somebody knocks since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection is he alone do you know them let 'em enter they are the faction o conspiracy sham'st thou to show thy dang'rous brow by night when evils are most free o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention i have been up this hour awake all night know i these men that come along with you he is welcome hither he is welcome too they are all welcome what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night give me your hands all over one by one no not an oath if not the face of men the sufferance of our souls the time's abuse  if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let high sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery but if these  as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valor the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath passed from him o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow anything that other men begin our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar let's be sacrificers but not butchers caius we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesar's spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide 'em this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be called purgers not murderers and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesar's arm when caesar's head is off alas good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wildness and much company peace count the clock by the eighth hour is that the uttermost now good metellus go along by him he loves me well and i have given him reasons send him but hither and i'll fashion him good gentlemen look fresh and merrily let not our looks put on our purposes but bear it as our roman actors do with untired spirits and formal constancy and so good morrow to you every one boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber thou hast no figures nor no fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men therefore thou sleep'st so sound portia what mean you wherefore rise you now it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning i am not well in health and that is all why so i do good portia go to bed kneel not gentle portia you are my true and honorable wife as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart o you gods render me worthy of this noble wife hark hark one knocks portia go in awhile and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart all my engagements i will construe to thee all the charactery of my sad brows leave me with haste lucius who 's that knocks caius ligarius that metellus spoke of  boy stand aside caius ligarius how o what a time have you chose out brave caius to wear a kerchief would you were not sick such an exploit have i in hand ligarius had you a healthful ear to hear of it a piece of work that will make sick men whole that must we also what it is my caius i shall unfold to thee as we are going to whom it must be done follow me then caesar 'tis strucken eight that every like is not the same o caesar the heart of brutus earns to think upon what said popilius lena look how he makes to caesar mark him cassius be constant popilius lena speaks not of our purposes for look he smiles and caesar doth not change he is addressed press near and second him i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal people and senators be not affrighted fly not stand still ambition's debt is paid where's publius talk not of standing publius good cheer there is no harm intended to your person nor to no roman else so tell them publius do so and let no man abide this deed but we the doers fates we will know your pleasures that we shall die we know 'tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon grant that and then is death a benefit so are we caesar's friends that have abridged his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop and let us bathe our hands in caesar's blood up to the elbows and besmear our swords then walk we forth even to the marketplace and waving our red weapons o'er our heads let's all cry peace freedom and liberty how many times shall caesar bleed in sport that now on pompey's basis lies along no worthier than the dust soft who comes here a friend of antony's thy master is a wise and valiant roman i never thought him worse tell him so please him come unto this place he shall be satisfied and by my honor depart untouched i know that we shall have him well to friend but here comes antony welcome mark antony o antony beg not your death of us though now we must appear bloody and cruel as by our hands and this our present act you see we do yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done our hearts you see not they are pitiful and pity to the general wrong of rome as fire drives out fire so pity pity hath done this deed on caesar for your part to you our swords have leaden points mark antony our arms in strength of malice and our hearts of brothers' temper do receive you in with all kind love good thoughts and reverence only be patient till we have appeased the multitude beside themselves with fear and then we will deliver you the cause why i that did love caesar when i struck him have thus proceeded or else were this a savage spectacle our reasons are so full of good regard that were you antony the son of caesar you should be satisfied you shall mark antony by your pardon i will myself into the pulpit first and show the reason of our caesar's death what antony shall speak i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies it shall advantage more than do us wrong mark antony here take you caesar's body you shall not in your funeral speech blame us but speak all good you can devise of caesar and say you do 't by our permission else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going after my speech is ended prepare the body then and follow us then follow me and give me audience friends  cassius go you into the other street and part the numbers  those that will hear me speak let 'em stay here those that will follow cassius go with him and public reasons shall be render\u00e8d of caesar's death be patient till the last romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear believe me for mine honor and have respect to mine honor that you may believe censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of caesar's to him i say that brutus' love to caesar was no less than his if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer not that i loved caesar less but that i loved rome more had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live all freemen as caesar loved me i weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was valiant i honor him but as he was ambitious i slew him there is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor and death for his ambition who is here so base that would be a bondman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so rude that would not be a roman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so vile that will not love his country if any speak for him have i offended i pause for a reply then none have i offended i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death here comes his body mourned by mark antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not with this i depart that as i slew my best lover for the good of rome i have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death my countrymen  good countrymen let me depart alone and for my sake stay here with antony do grace to caesar's corpse and grace his speech tending to caesar's glories which mark antony by our permission is allowed to make i do entreat you not a man depart save i alone till antony have spoke stand ho what now lucilius is cassius near he greets me well your master pindarus in his own change or by ill officers hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done undone but if he be at hand i shall be satisfied he is not doubted a word lucilius how he received you let me be resolved thou hast described a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius when love begins to sicken and decay it useth an enforc\u00e8d ceremony there are no tricks in plain and simple faith but hollow men like horses hot at hand make gallant show and promise of their mettle but when they should endure the bloody spur they fall their crests and like deceitful jades sink in the trial comes his army on hark he is arrived march gently on to meet him stand ho speak the word along judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies and if not so how should i wrong a brother cassius be content speak your griefs softly i do know you well before the eyes of both our armies here which should perceive nothing but love from us let us not wrangle bid them move away then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs and i will give you audience lucius do you the like and let no man come to our tent till we have done our conference let lucilius and titinius guard our door you wronged yourself to write in such a case let me tell you cassius you yourself are much condemned to have an itching palm to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers the name of cassius honors this corruption and chastisement doth therefore hide his head remember march the ides of march remember did not great julius bleed for justice' sake what villain touched his body that did stab and not for justice what shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes and sell the mighty space of our large honors for so much trash as may be grasp\u00e8d thus i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a roman go to you are not cassius i say you are not away slight man hear me for i will speak must i give way and room to your rash choler shall i be frighted when a madman stares all this ay more fret till your proud heart break go show your slaves how choleric you are and make your bondmen tremble must i budge must i observe you must i stand and crouch under your testy humor by the gods you shall digest the venom of your spleen though it do split you for from this day forth i'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter when you are waspish you say you are a better soldier let it appear so make your vaunting true and it shall please me well for mine own part i shall be glad to learn of noble men if you did i care not peace peace you durst not so have tempted him no for your life you durst not you have done that you should be sorry for there is no terror cassius in your threats for i am armed so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind which i respect not i did send to you for certain sums of gold which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means by heaven i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection i did send to you for gold to pay my legions which you denied me was that done like cassius should i have answered caius cassius so when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends be ready gods with all your thunderbolts dash him to pieces you did i do not till you practice them on me i do not like your faults a flatterer's would not though they do appear as huge as high olympus sheathe your dagger be angry when you will it shall have scope do what you will dishonor shall be humor o cassius you are yok\u00e8d with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire who much enforc\u00e8d shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again when i spoke that i was ill tempered too and my heart too what's the matter yes cassius and from henceforth when you are over earnest with your brutus he'll think your mother chides and leave you so get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence i'll know his humor when he knows his time what should the wars do with these jigging fools  companion hence lucilius and titinius bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight lucius a bowl of wine o cassius i am sick of many griefs no man bears sorrow better portia is dead she is dead impatient of my absence and grief that young octavius with mark antony have made themselves so strong for with her death that tidings came with this she fell distract and her attendants absent swallowed fire even so speak no more of her give me a bowl of wine  in this i bury all unkindness cassius come in titinius welcome good messala now sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities no more i pray you  messala i have here receiv\u00e8d letters that young octavius and mark antony come down upon us with a mighty power bending their expedition toward philippi with what addition therein our letters do not well agree mine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions cicero being one no messala nothing messala why ask you hear you aught of her in yours now as you are a roman tell me true why farewell portia we must die messala with meditating that she must die once i have the patience to endure it now well to our work alive what do you think of marching to philippi presently your reason good reasons must of force give place to better the people 'twixt philippi and this ground do stand but in a forced affection for they have grudged us contribution the enemy marching along by them by them shall make a fuller number up come on refreshed new added and encouraged from which advantage shall we cut him off if at philippi we do face him there these people at our back under your pardon you must note besides that we have tried the utmost of our friends our legions are brim full our cause is ripe the enemy increaseth every day we at the height are ready to decline there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures the deep of night is crept upon our talk and nature must obey necessity which we will niggard with a little rest there is no more to say lucius my gown farewell good messala  good night titinius noble noble cassius good night and good repose everything is well good night good brother farewell everyone give me the gown where is thy instrument what thou speak'st drowsily poor knave i blame thee not thou art o'erwatched call claudius and some other of my men i'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent i pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep it may be i shall raise you by and by on business to my brother cassius i will not have it so lie down good sirs it may be i shall otherwise bethink me look lucius here's the book i sought for so i put it in the pocket of my gown bear with me good boy i am much forgetful canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile and touch thy instrument a strain or two it does my boy i trouble thee too much but thou art willing i should not urge thy duty past thy might i know young bloods look for a time of rest it was well done and thou shalt sleep again i will not hold thee long if i do live i will be good to thee this is a sleepy tune o murd'rous slumber layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy that plays thee music gentle knave good night i will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee if thou dost nod thou break'st thy instrument i'll take it from thee and good boy good night let me see let me see is not the leaf turned down where i left reading here it is i think how ill this taper burns ha who comes here  i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition it comes upon me art thou any thing art thou some god some angel or some devil that mak'st my blood cold and my hair to stare speak to me what thou art why com'st thou well then i shall see thee again why i will see thee at philippi then now i have taken heart thou vanishest ill spirit i would hold more talk with thee  boy lucius varro claudius sirs awake claudius he thinks he still is at his instrument lucius awake didst thou dream lucius that thou so criedst out yes that thou didst didst thou see anything sleep again lucius sirrah claudius fellow thou awake why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep ay saw you anything go and commend me to my brother cassius bid him set on his powers betimes before and we will follow they stand and would have parley words before blows is it so countrymen good words are better than bad strokes octavius o yes and soundless too for you have stolen their buzzing antony and very wisely threat before you sting caesar thou canst not die by traitors' hands unless thou bring'st them with thee o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain young man thou couldst not die more honorable ho lucilius hark a word with you even so lucilius even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below no cassius no think not thou noble roman that ever brutus will go bound to rome he bears too great a mind but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun and whether we shall meet again i know not therefore our everlasting farewell take forever and forever farewell cassius if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made why then lead on o that a man might know the end of this day's business ere it come but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known come ho away ride ride messala ride and give these bills unto the legions on the other side let them set on at once for i perceive but cold demeanor in octavius' wing and sudden push gives them the overthrow ride ride messala let them all come down where where messala doth his body lie titinius' face is upward o julius caesar thou art mighty yet thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords in our own proper entrails are yet two romans living such as these  the last of all the romans fare thee well it is impossible that ever rome should breed thy fellow friends i owe more tears to this dead man than you shall see me pay  i shall find time cassius i shall find time  come therefore and to thasos send his body his funerals shall not be in our camp lest it discomfort us lucilius come  and come young cato let us to the field  labeo and flavius set our battles on 'tis three o'clock

deed in fashion hark thee clitus peace then no words hark thee dardanus come hither good volumnius list a word why this volumnius the ghost of caesar hath appeared to me two several times by night at

worthy to leap in ourselves than tarry till they push us good volumnius thou know'st that we two went to school together even for that our love of old i prithee hold thou my sword hilts whilst i run on it farewell to you and you and you volumnius  strato thou hast been all this while asleep farewell to thee too strato countrymen my heart doth joy that yet in all my life i found no man but he was true to me i shall have glory by this losing day more than octavius and mark antony by this vile conquest shall attain unto so fare you well at once for brutus' tongue hath almost ended his life's history night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest that have but labored to attain this hour hence i will follow i prithee strato stay thou by thy lord thou art a fellow of a good respect thy life

martius your old enemy who is of rome worse hated than of you and titus lartius a most valiant roman these three lead on this preparation whither 'tis bent most likely 'tis for you consider of it nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretenses veiled till when they needs must show themselves which in the hatching it seemed appeared to rome by the discovery we shall be shortened in our aim which was to take in many towns ere almost rome should know we were afoot o doubt not that i speak from certainties nay more some parcels of their power are forth already and only hitherward i leave your honors if we and caius martius chance to meet 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more and keep your honors safe we hate alike not afric owns a serpent i abhor more than thy fame and envy fix thy foot if i fly martius hollo me like a hare wert thou the hector that was the whip of your bragged progeny thou shouldst not scape me here officious and not valiant you have

he's mine or i am his mine emulation hath not that honor in 't it had for where i thought to crush him in an equal force true sword to sword i'll potch at him some way or wrath or craft may get him bolder though not so subtle my valor's poisoned with only suff'ring stain by him for him shall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuary being naked sick nor fane nor capitol the prayers of priests

not thy name o martius martius each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things and say 'tis true i'd not believe them more than thee all noble martius let me twine mine arms about that body whereagainst my grain\u00e8d ash an hundred times hath broke and scarred the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my

best thou art experienced since thou know'st thy country's strength and weakness thine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them ere destroy but come in let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes and more a friend than ere an enemy  yet martius that was much your hand most welcome do they still fly to th' roman i cannot help it now unless by using means i lame the foot of our design he bears himself more proudlier even to my person than i thought he would when first i did embrace him yet his nature in that's no changeling and i must excuse what cannot be amended i understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not what i can urge against him although it seems and so he thinks and is no less apparent to th' vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon as draw his sword yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine whene'er we come to our account all places yields to him ere he sits down and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too the tribunes are no soldiers and their people will be as rash in the repeal as hasty to expel him thence i think he'll be to rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes it by sovereignty of nature first he was a noble servant to them but he could not carry his honors even whether 'twas pride which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man whether defect of judgment to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of or whether nature not to be other than one thing not moving from th' casque to th' cushion but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controlled the war but one of these  as he hath spices of them all not all for i dare so far free him made him feared so hated and so banished but he has a merit to choke

purge himself with words dispatch most welcome even so as with a man by his own alms empoisoned and with his charity slain sir i cannot tell we must proceed as we do find the people i know it and my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction i raised him and i pawned mine honor for his truth who being so heightened he watered his new plants with dews of flattery seducing so my friends and to this end he bowed his nature never known before but to be rough unswayable and free that i would have spoke of being banished for 't he came unto my hearth presented to my knife his throat i took him made him joint servant with me gave him way in all his own desires nay let him choose out of my files his projects to accomplish my best and freshest men served his designments in mine own person holp to reap the fame which he did end all his and took some pride to do myself this wrong till at the last i seemed his follower not partner and he waged me with his countenance as if i had been mercenary there was it for which my sinews shall be stretched upon him at a few drops of women's rheum which are as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labor of our great action therefore shall he die and i'll renew me in his fall but hark say no more here come the lords i have not deserved it but worthy lords have you with heed perused what i have written to you he approaches you shall hear

prosperous voyages i often made to epidamium till my factor's death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear  had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arriv\u00e8d where i was there had she not been long but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons and which was strange the one so like the other as could not be distinguished but by names that very hour and in the selfsame inn a mean woman was

incessant weepings of my wife weeping before for what she saw must come and piteous plainings of the pretty babes that mourned for fashion ignorant what to fear forced me to seek delays for them and me and this it was for other means was none the sailors sought for safety by our boat and left the ship then sinking ripe to us my wife more careful for the latter born had fastened him unto a small spare mast such as seafaring men provide for storms to him one of the other twins was bound whilst i had been like heedful of the other the children thus disposed my wife and i fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed fastened ourselves at either end the mast and floating straight obedient to the stream was carried towards corinth as we thought at length the sun gazing upon the earth dispersed those vapors that offended us and by the benefit of his wished light the seas waxed calm and we discover\u00e8d two ships from far making amain to us of corinth that of epidaurus this but ere they came o let me say no more gather the sequel by that went before o had the gods done so i had not now worthily termed them merciless to us for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encountered by a mighty rock which being violently borne upon our helpful ship was splitted in the midst so that in this unjust divorce of us fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in what to sorrow for her part poor soul seeming as burden\u00e8d with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length another ship had seized on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave healthful welcome to their shipwracked guests and would have reft the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus have you heard me severed from my bliss that by misfortunes was my life prolonged to tell sad stories of my own mishaps my youngest boy and yet my eldest care at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother and importuned me that his attendant so his case was like reft of his

you who my lord the devil speed him no man's pie is freed from his ambitious finger what had he to do in these fierce vanities i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o' th' beneficial sun and keep it from the earth why the devil upon this french going out took he upon him without the privity o' th' king t' appoint who should attend on him he makes up the file of all the gentry for the most part such to whom as great a charge as little honor he meant to lay upon and his own letter the honorable board of council out must fetch him in he papers o many have broke their

give me favor sir this cunning cardinal the articles o' th' combination drew as himself pleased and they were ratified as he cried thus let be to as much end as give a crutch to th' dead but our count cardinal has done this and 'tis well for worthy wolsey who cannot err he did it now this follows  which as i take it is a kind of puppy to th' old dam treason charles the emperor under pretense to see the queen his aunt  for 'twas indeed his color but he came to whisper wolsey here makes visitation his fears were that the interview betwixt england and france might through their amity breed him some prejudice for from this league peeped harms that menaced him privily deals with our cardinal and as i trow  which i do well for i am sure the emperor paid ere he promised whereby his suit was granted ere it was asked but when the way was made and paved with gold the emperor thus desired that he would please to alter the king's course and break the foresaid peace let the king know  as soon he shall

his hoof is more musical than the pipe of hermes and of the heat of the ginger it is a beast for perseus he is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you may call beasts it is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey it is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into

what tumult 's this we charge you on allegiance to ourself to hold your slaught'ring hands and keep the peace  pray uncle gloucester mitigate this strife o how this discord doth afflict my soul can you my lord of winchester behold my sighs and tears and will not once relent who should be pitiful if you be not or who should study to prefer a peace if holy churchmen take delight in broils fie

gloucester  how joyful am i made by this contract away my masters trouble us no more but join in friendship as your lords have done and those occasions uncle were of force  therefore my loving lords our pleasure is that richard be restor\u00e8d to his blood if richard will be true not that alone but all the whole inheritance i give that doth belong unto the house of york from whence you spring by lineal descent stoop then and set your knee against my foot and in reguerdon of that duty done i girt thee with the valiant sword of york rise richard like a true plantagenet and rise created princely duke of york when gloucester says the word king henry goes for friendly counsel cuts off many foes is this the lord talbot uncle gloucester that hath so long been resident in france welcome brave captain and victorious lord when i was young as yet i am not old  i do remember how my father said a stouter champion never handled sword long since we were resolv\u00e8d of your truth your faithful service and your toil in war yet never have you tasted our reward or been reguerdoned with so much as thanks because till now we never saw your face therefore stand up and for these good deserts we here create you earl of shrewsbury and in our coronation take your place stain to thy countrymen thou hear'st thy doom be packing therefore thou that wast a knight henceforth we banish thee on pain of death and now my lord protector view the letter sent from our uncle duke of burgundy what doth my uncle burgundy revolt is that the worst this letter doth contain why then lord talbot there shall talk with him and give him chastisement for this abuse  how say you my lord are you not content then gather strength and march unto him straight let him perceive how ill we brook his treason and what offense it is to flout his friends be patient lords and give them leave to speak  say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim and wherefore crave you combat or with whom what is that wrong whereof you both complain first let me know and then i'll answer you good lord what madness rules in brainsick men when for so slight and frivolous a cause such factious emulations shall arise good cousins both of york and somerset quiet yourselves i pray and be at peace come hither you that would be combatants henceforth i charge you as you love our favor quite to forget this quarrel and the cause  and you my lords remember where we are in france amongst a fickle wavering nation if they perceive dissension in our looks and that within ourselves we disagree how will their grudging stomachs be provoked to willful disobedience and rebel besides what infamy will there arise when foreign princes shall be certified that for a toy a thing of no regard king henry's peers and chief nobility destroyed themselves and lost the realm of france o think upon the conquest of my father my tender years and let us not forgo that for a trifle that was bought with blood let me be umpire in this doubtful strife i see no reason if i wear this rose that anyone should therefore be suspicious i more incline to somerset than york both are my kinsmen and i love them both as well they may upbraid me with my crown because forsooth the king of scots is crowned but your discretions better can persuade than i am able to instruct or teach and therefore as we hither came in peace so let us still continue peace and love cousin of york we institute your grace to be our regent in these parts of france  and good my lord of somerset unite your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot and like true subjects sons of your progenitors go cheerfully together and digest your angry choler on your enemies ourself my lord protector and the rest after some respite will return to callice from thence to england where i hope ere long to be presented by your victories with charles alanson and that traitorous rout have you perused the letters from the pope the emperor and the earl of armagnac how doth your grace affect their motion ay marry uncle for i always thought it was both impious and unnatural that such immanity and bloody strife should reign among professors of one faith marriage uncle alas my years are

choice tends to god's glory and my country's weal my lords ambassadors your several suits have been considered and debated on your purpose is both good and reasonable and therefore are we certainly resolved to draw conditions of a friendly peace which by my lord of winchester we mean shall be transported presently to france in argument and proof of which contract bear her this jewel pledge of my

hath astonished me her virtues grac\u00e8d with external gifts do breed love's settled passions in my heart and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwrack or arrive where i may have fruition of her love and otherwise will henry ne'er presume  therefore my lord protector give consent that margaret

ever marquess gave the fairest queen that ever king received long live queen margaret england's happiness my lord protector so it please your grace here are the articles of contracted peace between

king madam be patient as i was cause your highness came to england so will i in england work your grace's full content and he of these that can do most of all cannot do more in england than the nevilles salisbury and warwick are no simple peers madam myself have limed a bush for her and placed a choir of such enticing birds that she will light to listen to the lays and never mount to trouble you again so let her rest and madam list to me for i am bold to counsel you in this although we fancy not the cardinal yet must we join with him and with the lords till we have brought duke humphrey in disgrace as for the duke of york this late complaint will make but little for his benefit so one by one we'll weed them all at last and you yourself shall steer the happy helm resign it then and leave thine insolence since thou wert king as who is king but thou  the commonwealth hath daily run to wrack the dauphin hath prevailed beyond the seas and all the peers and nobles of the realm have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty before we make election give me leave to show some reason of no little force that york is most unmeet of any man peace headstrong warwick because here is a man accused of treason pray god the duke of york excuse himself please it your majesty this is the man that doth accuse his master of high treason his words were these that richard duke of york was rightful heir unto the english crown and that your majesty was an usurper no marvel an it like your majesty my lord protector's hawks do tower so well they know their master loves to be aloft and bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch no malice sir no more than well becomes so good a quarrel and so bad a peer why as you my lord an 't like your lordly lord protectorship come to the king and tell him what miracle what woman is this how cam'st thou so and yet i think jet did he never see true made the lame to leap and fly away thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays thus eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days well hath your highness seen into this duke and had i first been put to speak my mind i think i should have told your grace's tale the duchess by his subornation upon my life began her devilish practices or if he were not privy to those faults yet by reputing of his high descent  as next the king he was successive heir and such high vaunts of his nobility  did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess by wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall smooth runs the water where the brook is deep and in his simple show he harbors treason the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb no no my sovereign gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon unless thou wert more loyal than thou art i do arrest thee of high treason here my lord these faults are easy quickly answered but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge whereof you cannot easily purge yourself i do arrest you in his highness' name and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep until your further time of trial hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominious words though clerkly couched as if she had suborn\u00e8d some to swear false allegations to o'erthrow his state but in my mind that were no policy the king will labor still to save his life the commons haply rise to save his life and yet we have but trivial argument more than mistrust that shows him worthy death ah york no man alive so fain as i madam 'tis true and were 't not madness then to make the fox surveyor of the fold  who being accused a crafty murderer his guilt should be but idly posted over because his purpose is not executed no let him die in that he is a fox by nature proved an enemy to the flock before his chaps be stained with crimson blood as humphrey proved by reasons to my liege and do not stand on quillets how to slay him  be it by gins by snares by subtlety sleeping or waking 'tis no matter how so he be dead for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit not resolute except so much were done for things are often spoke and seldom meant but that my heart accordeth with my tongue seeing the deed is meritorious and to preserve my sovereign from his foe say but the word and i will be his priest here is my hand the deed is worthy doing why our authority is his consent and what we do establish he confirms then noble york take thou this task in hand a charge lord york that i will see performed but now return we to the false duke humphrey i'll see it truly done my lord of york now sirs have you dispatched this thing why that's well said go get you to my house i will reward you for this venturous deed the king and all the peers are here at hand have you laid fair the

will you bid me leave now by the ground that i am banished from well could i curse away a winter's night though standing naked on a mountain top where biting cold would never let grass grow and think it but a minute spent in sport thus is poor suffolk ten times banish\u00e8d once by the king and three times thrice by thee 'tis not the land i care for wert thou thence a wilderness is populous enough so suffolk had thy heavenly company for where thou art there is the world itself with every several pleasure in the world and where thou art not desolation i can no more live thou to joy thy

to stop my mouth so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul or i should breathe it so into thy body and then it lived in sweet elysium to die by thee were but to die in jest from thee to die were

bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof i cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your grace's request in my stead i beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for i never knew so young a body with so old a head i leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation you hear

holds this present question in the court antonio and old shylock both stand forth that thou shalt see the difference of our spirit i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it for half thy wealth it is

i entreat you home with me to dinner i am sorry that your leisure serves you not  antonio gratify this gentleman for in my mind you are much bound to him", "MV_Antonio": "in sooth i know not why i am so sad it wearies me you say it wearies you but how i caught it found it or came by it what stuff 'tis made of whereof it is born i am to learn and such a want wit sadness makes of me that i have much ado to know myself believe me no i thank my fortune for it my ventures are not in one bottom trusted nor to one place nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year therefore my merchandise makes me not sad fie fie your worth is very dear in my regard i take it your own business calls on you and you embrace th' occasion to depart i hold the world but as the world gratiano a stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one fare you well i'll grow a talker for this gear is that anything now well tell me now what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage that you today promised to tell me of i pray you good bassanio let me know it and if it stand as you yourself still do within the eye of honor be assured my purse my person my extremest means lie all unlocked to your occasions you know me well and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done and i am prest unto it therefore speak thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth try what my credit can in venice do that shall be racked even to the uttermost to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia go presently inquire and so will i where money is and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake shylock albeit i neither lend nor borrow by taking nor by giving of excess yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend i'll break a custom is he yet possessed how much you would and for three months i do never use it and what of him did he take interest this was a venture sir that jacob served for a thing not in his power to bring to pass but swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven was this inserted to make interest good or is your gold and silver ewes and rams mark you this bassanio the devil can cite scripture for his purpose an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek a goodly apple rotten at the heart o what a goodly outside falsehood hath well shylock shall we be beholding to you i am as like to call thee so again to spet on thee again to spurn thee too if thou wilt lend this money lend it not as to thy friends for when did friendship take a breed for barren metal of his friend but lend it rather to thine enemy who if he break thou mayst with better face exact the penalty content in faith i'll seal to such a bond and say there is much kindness in the jew why fear not man i will not forfeit it within these two months that's a month before this bond expires i do expect return of thrice three times the value of this bond yes shylock i will seal unto this bond hie thee gentle jew the hebrew will turn christian he grows kind come on in this there can be no dismay my ships come home a month before the day who's there fie fie gratiano where are all the rest 'tis nine o'clock our friends all stay for you no masque tonight the wind is come about bassanio presently will go aboard i have sent twenty out to seek for you hear me yet good shylock  i pray thee hear me speak  let him alone i'll follow him no more with bootless prayers he seeks my life his reason well i know i oft delivered from his forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me therefore he hates me the duke cannot deny the course of law for the commodity that strangers have with us in venice if it be denied will much impeach the justice of the state since that the trade and profit of the city consisteth of all nations therefore go these griefs and losses have so bated me that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh tomorrow to my bloody creditor  well jailer on pray god bassanio come to see me pay his debt and then i care not ready so please your grace i have heard your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envy's reach i do oppose my patience to his fury and am armed to suffer with a quietness of spirit the very tyranny and rage of his i pray you think you question with the jew you may as well go stand upon the beach and bid the main flood bate his usual height you may as well use question with the wolf why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb you may as well forbid the mountain pines to wag their high tops and to make no noise when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven you may as well do anything most hard as seek to soften that than which what's harder  his jewish heart therefore i do beseech you make no more offers use no farther means but with all brief and plain conveniency let me have judgment and the jew his will i am a tainted wether of the flock meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground and so let me you cannot better be employed bassanio than to live still and write mine epitaph ay so he says i do most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment but little i am armed and well prepared  give me your hand bassanio fare you well grieve not that i am fall'n to this for you for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom it is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow an age of poverty from which ling'ring penance of such misery doth she cut me off commend me to your honorable wife tell her the process of antonio's end say how i loved you speak me fair in death and when the tale is told bid her be judge whether bassanio had not once a love repent but you that you shall lose your friend and he repents not that he pays your debt for if the jew do cut but deep enough i'll pay it instantly with all my heart so please my lord the duke and all the court to quit the fine for one half of his goods i am content so he will let me have the other half in use to render it upon his death unto the gentleman that lately stole his daughter two things provided more that for this favor he presently become a christian the other that he do record a gift here in the court of all he dies possessed unto his son lorenzo and his daughter and stand indebted over and above in love and service to you evermore my lord bassanio let him have the ring let his deservings and my love withal be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment no more than i am well acquitted of i am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels i once did lend my body for his wealth which but for him that had your husband's ring had quite miscarried i dare be bound again my soul upon the forfeit that your lord will never more break faith advisedly here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring i am dumb sweet lady

not honest honest ay honest what dost thou think think my lord by heaven thou echo'st me as if there were some monster in thy thought too hideous to be shown thou dost mean something i heard thee say even now thou lik'st not that when cassio left my wife what didst not like and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing thou cried'st indeed and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit if thou dost love me show me thy thought i think thou dost and for i know thou 'rt full of love and honesty and weigh'st thy words before thou giv'st them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom but in a man that's just they're close dilations working from the heart that passion cannot rule i think so too certain men should be what they seem nay yet there's more in this i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words thou dost conspire against thy friend iago if thou but think'st him wronged and mak'st his ear a stranger to thy thoughts what dost thou mean by heaven i'll know thy thoughts ha o misery why why is this think'st thou i'd make a life of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises matching thy inference 'tis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are more virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me no iago i'll see before i doubt when i doubt prove and on the proof there is no more but this away at once with love or jealousy dost thou say so and so she did i am bound to thee forever not a jot not a jot i will not no not much moved i do not think but desdemona's honest and yet how nature erring from itself  farewell farewell if more thou dost perceive let me know more set on thy wife to observe leave me iago why did i marry this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more much more than he unfolds fear not my government this fellow's of exceeding honesty and knows all qualities with a learn\u00e8d spirit of human dealings if i do prove her haggard though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings i'd whistle her off and let her down the wind to prey at fortune haply for i am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have or for i am declined into the vale of years yet that's not much  she's gone i am abused and my relief must be to loathe her o curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapor of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others' uses yet 'tis the plague of great ones prerogatived are they less than the base 'tis destiny unshunnable like death even then this fork\u00e8d plague is fated to us when we do quicken look where she comes if she be false heaven mocks itself i'll not believe 't i am to blame i have a pain upon my forehead here your napkin is too little let it alone come i'll go in with you ha ha false to me avaunt begone thou hast set me on the rack i swear 'tis better to be much abused than but to know 't a little what sense had i of her stol'n hours of lust i saw 't not thought it not it harmed not me i slept the next night well fed well was free and merry i found not cassio's kisses on her lips he that is robbed not wanting what is stol'n let him not know 't and he's not robbed at all i had been happy if the general camp pioners and all had tasted her sweet body so i had nothing known o now forever farewell the tranquil mind farewell content farewell the plum\u00e8d troops and the big wars that makes ambition virtue o farewell farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spirit stirring drum th' ear piercing fife the royal banner and all quality pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war and o you mortal engines whose rude throats th' immortal jove's dread clamors counterfeit farewell othello's occupation's gone villain be sure thou prove my love a whore be sure of it give me the ocular proof or by the worth of mine eternal soul thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my waked wrath make me to see 't or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life if thou dost slander her and torture me never pray more abandon all remorse on horror's head horrors accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that nay stay thou shouldst be honest by the world i think my wife be honest and think she is not i think that thou art just and think thou art not i'll have some proof her name that was as fresh as dian's visage is now begrimed and black as mine own face if there be cords or knives poison or fire or suffocating streams i'll not endure it would i were satisfied would nay and i will death and damnation o give me a living reason she's disloyal o monstrous monstrous but this denoted a foregone conclusion 'tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream i'll tear her all to pieces i gave her such a one 'twas my first gift if it be that  o that the slave had forty thousand lives one is too poor too weak for my revenge now do i see 'tis true look here iago all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven 'tis gone arise black vengeance from the hollow hell yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught for 'tis of aspics' tongues o blood blood blood never iago like to the pontic sea whose icy current and compulsive course ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on to the propontic and the hellespont even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them up now by yond marble heaven in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words i greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous and will upon the instant put thee to 't within these three days let me hear thee say that cassio's not alive damn her lewd minx o damn her damn her come go with me apart i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil now art thou my lieutenant well my good lady o hardness to dissemble  how do you desdemona give me your hand this hand is moist my lady this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer much castigation exercise devout for here's a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels 'tis a good hand a frank one a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands but our new heraldry is hands not hearts what promise chuck i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me lend me thy handkerchief that which i gave you not that's a fault that handkerchief did an egyptian to my mother give she was a charmer and could almost read the thoughts of people she told her while she kept it 'twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to

wived to give it her i did so and take heed on 't make it a darling like your precious eye to lose 't or give 't away were such perdition as nothing else could match 'tis true there's magic in the web

affliction had they rained all kind of sores and shames on my bare head steeped me in poverty to the very lips given to captivity me and my utmost hopes i should have found in some place of my soul a drop of patience but alas to make me a fix\u00e8d figure for the time of scorn to point his slow unmoving finger at  yet could i bear that too well very well but there where i have garnered up my heart where either i must live or bear no life the fountain from the which my current runs or else dries up to be discarded thence or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in turn thy complexion there patience thou young and rose lipped cherubin ay there look grim as hell o ay as summer flies are in the shambles that quicken even with blowing o thou weed who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst ne'er been born was this fair paper this most goodly book made to write whore upon what committed committed o thou public commoner i should make very forges of my cheeks that would to cinders burn up modesty did i but speak thy deeds what committed heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets is hushed within the hollow mine of earth and will not hear 't what committed impudent strumpet are not you a strumpet what not a whore is 't possible i cry you mercy then i took you for that cunning whore of venice that married with othello you mistress that have the office opposite to saint peter and keeps the gate of hell you you ay you we have done our course there's money for your pains i pray you turn the key and keep our counsel o pardon me 'twill do me good to walk will you walk sir o desdemona  get you to bed on th' instant i will be returned forthwith dismiss your

dear lies dead and your unblest fate hies strumpet i come forth of my heart those charms thine eyes are blotted thy bed lust stained shall with lust's blood be spotted it is the cause it is the cause my soul let me not name it to you you chaste stars it is the cause yet i'll not shed her blood nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow and smooth as monumental alabaster yet she must die else she'll betray more men put out the light and then put out the light if i quench thee thou flaming minister i can again thy former light restore should i repent me but once put out thy light thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature i know not where is that promethean heat that can thy light relume when i have plucked the rose i cannot give it vital growth again it needs must wither i'll smell it on the tree o balmy breath that dost almost persuade justice to break her sword one more one more be thus when thou art dead and i will kill thee and love thee after one more and this the last so sweet was ne'er so fatal i must weep but they are cruel tears this sorrow's heavenly it strikes where it doth love she wakes ay desdemona have you prayed tonight desdemon if you bethink yourself of any crime unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace solicit for it straight well do it and be brief i will walk by i would not kill thy unprepar\u00e8d spirit no heaven forfend i would not kill thy soul ay i do amen with all my heart humh think on thy sins ay and for that thou diest peace and be still that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee thou gav'st to cassio sweet soul take heed take heed of perjury thou art on thy deathbed yes presently therefore confess thee freely of thy sin for to deny each article with oath cannot remove nor choke the strong conception that i do groan withal thou art to die i say amen by heaven i saw my handkerchief in 's hand o perjured woman thou dost stone my heart and mak'st me call what i intend to do a murder which i thought a sacrifice i saw the handkerchief he hath confessed that he hath used thee ay no his mouth is stopped honest iago hath ta'en order for 't had all his hairs been lives my great revenge had stomach for them all out strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face down strumpet nay if you strive  being done there is no pause it is too late what noise is this not dead not yet quite dead i that am cruel am yet merciful i would not have thee linger in thy pain so so who's there yes 'tis emilia by and by she's dead 'tis like she comes to speak of cassio's death the noise was here ha no more moving still as the grave shall she come in were 't good i think she stirs again no what's best to do if she come in she'll sure speak to my wife my wife my wife what wife i have no wife o insupportable o heavy hour methinks it should be now a huge eclipse of sun and moon and that th' affrighted globe should yawn at alteration i had forgot thee o come in emilia  soft by and by let me the curtains draw  where art thou what's the matter with thee now what now it is the very error of the moon she comes more nearer earth than she was wont and makes men mad roderigo killed and cassio killed not cassio killed then murder's out of tune and sweet revenge grows harsh that what why how should she be murdered you heard her say herself it was not i she's like a liar gone to burning hell 'twas i that killed her she turned to folly and she was a whore she was false as water cassio did top her ask thy husband else o i were damned beneath all depth in hell but that i did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity thy husband knew it all thy husband ay with cassio had she been true if heaven would make me such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite i'd not have sold her for it ay 'twas he that told me on her first an honest man he is and hates the slime that sticks on filthy deeds what needs this iterance woman i say thy husband he woman i say thy husband dost understand the word my friend thy husband honest honest iago hah peace you were best nay stare not masters it is true indeed o o o o she was foul  i scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopped i know this act shows horrible and grim 'tis pitiful but yet iago knows that she with cassio hath the act of shame a thousand times committed cassio confessed it and she did gratify his amorous works with that recognizance and pledge of love which i first gave her i saw it in his hand it was a handkerchief an antique token my father gave my mother are there no stones in heaven but what serves for the thunder precious villain i am not valiant neither but every puny whipster gets my sword but why should honor outlive honesty let it go all i have another weapon in this chamber it is a sword of spain the ice brook's temper o here it is uncle i must come forth look in upon me then and speak with me or naked as i am i will assault thee behold i have a weapon a better never did itself sustain upon a soldier's thigh i have seen the day that with this little arm and this good sword i have made my way through more impediments than twenty times your stop but o vain boast  who can control his fate 'tis not so now be not afraid though you do see me weaponed here is my journey's end here is my butt and very sea mark of my utmost sail do you go back dismayed 'tis a lost fear man but a rush against othello's breast and he retires where should othello go now how dost thou look now o ill starred wench pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven and fiends will snatch at it cold cold my girl even like thy chastity o curs\u00e8d curs\u00e8d slave  whip me you devils from the possession of this heavenly sight blow me about in winds roast me in sulfur wash me in steep down gulfs of liquid fire o desdemon dead desdemon dead o o that's he that was othello here i am i look down towards his feet but that's a fable  if that thou be'st a devil i cannot kill thee i am not sorry neither i'd have thee live for in my sense 'tis happiness to die why anything an honorable murderer if you will for naught i did in hate but all in honor ay i do believe it and i ask your pardon will you i pray demand that demi devil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body well thou dost best o villain o thou pernicious caitiff  how came you cassio by that handkerchief that was my wife's o fool fool fool soft you a word or two before you go i have done the state some service and they know 't no more of that i pray you in your letters when you shall these unlucky deeds relate speak of me as i am nothing extenuate nor set down aught in malice then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well of one not easily jealous but being wrought perplexed in the extreme of one whose hand like the base judean threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes albeit unused to the melting mood drops tears as fast as the arabian trees their medicinable gum set you down this and say besides that in aleppo once where a malignant and a turbanned turk beat a venetian and traduced the state i took by th' throat the circumcis\u00e8d dog and smote him thus i kissed thee ere i killed thee no way but this killing myself to die upon a kiss", "TN_Malvolio": "yes and shall do till the pangs of death shake him infirmity that decays the wise doth ever make the better fool i marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal i saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone look you now he's out of his guard already unless you laugh and minister occasion to him he is gagged i protest i take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools' zanies madam yond young fellow swears he will speak with you i told him you were sick he takes on him to understand so much and therefore comes to speak with you i told him you were asleep he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too and therefore comes to speak with you what is to be said to him lady he's fortified against any denial has been told so and he says he'll stand at your door like a sheriff's post and be the supporter to a bench but he'll speak with you why of mankind of very ill manner he'll speak with you will you or no not yet old enough for a man nor young enough for a boy as a squash is before 'tis a peascod or a codling when 'tis almost an apple 'tis with him in standing water between boy and man he is very well favored and he speaks very shrewishly one would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him gentlewoman my lady calls here madam at your service madam i will were not you even now with the countess olivia she returns this ring to you sir you might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself she adds moreover that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him and one thing more that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs unless it be to report your lord's taking of this receive it so come sir you peevishly threw it to her and her will is it should be so returned if it be worth stooping for there it lies in your eye if not be it his that finds it my masters are you mad or what are you have you no wit manners nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night do you make an ale house of my lady's house that you squeak out your coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice is there no respect of place persons nor time in you sir toby i must be round with you my lady bade me tell you that though she harbors you as her kinsman she's nothing allied to your disorders if you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors you are welcome to the house if not an it would please you to take leave of her she is very willing to bid you farewell is 't even so this is much credit to you mistress mary if you prized my lady's favor at anything more than contempt you would not give means for this uncivil rule she shall know of it by this hand 'tis but fortune all is fortune maria once told me she did affect me and i have heard herself come thus near that should she fancy it should be one of my complexion besides she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her what should i think on 't to be count malvolio there is example for 't the lady of the strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe having been three months married to her sitting in my state  calling my officers about me in my branched velvet gown having come from a daybed where i have left olivia sleeping  and then to have the humor of state and after a demure travel of regard telling them i know my place as i would they should do theirs to ask for my kinsman toby  seven of my people with an obedient start make out for him i frown the while and perchance wind up my watch or play with my some rich jewel toby approaches curtsies there to me  i extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control  saying cousin toby my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech  you must amend your drunkenness besides you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight  one sir andrew what employment have we here by my life this is my lady's hand these be her very 's her 's and her 's and thus she makes her great 's it is in contempt of question her hand to the unknown beloved this and my good wishes her very phrases by your leave wax soft and the impressure her lucrece with which she uses to seal 'tis my lady to whom should this be jove knows i love but who lips do not move no man must know no man must know what follows the numbers altered no man must know if this should be thee malvolio i may command where i adore but silence like a lucrece knife with bloodless stroke my heart doth gore moai doth sway my life moai doth sway my life nay but first let me see let me see let me see i may command where i adore why she may command me i serve her she is my lady why this is evident to any formal capacity there is no obstruction in this and the end what should that alphabetical position portend if i could make that resemble something in me softly moai  m malvolio m why that begins my name m but then there is no consonancy in the sequel that suffers under probation a should follow but o does and then i comes behind moai this simulation is not as the former and yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for every one of these letters are in my name soft here follows prose if this fall into thy hand revolve in my stars i am above thee but be not afraid of greatness some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon 'em thy fates open their hands let thy blood and spirit embrace them and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be cast thy humble slough and appear fresh be opposite with a kinsman surly with servants let thy tongue tang arguments of state put thyself into the trick of singularity she thus advises thee that sighs for thee remember who commended thy yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever cross gartered i say remember go to thou art made if thou desir'st to be so if not let me see thee a steward still the fellow of servants and not worthy to touch fortune's fingers farewell she that would alter services with thee the fortunate unhappy daylight and champian discovers not more this is open i will be proud i will read politic authors i will baffle sir toby i will wash off gross acquaintance i will be point devise the very man i do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me for every reason excites to this that my lady loves me she did commend my yellow stockings of late she did praise my leg being cross gartered and in this she manifests herself to my love and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking i thank my stars i am happy i will be strange stout in yellow stockings and cross gartered even with the swiftness of putting on jove and my stars be praised here is yet a postscript thou canst not choose but know who i am if thou entertain'st my love let it appear in thy smiling thy smiles become thee well therefore in my presence still smile dear my sweet i prithee jove i thank thee i will smile i will do everything that thou

well 'tis too true she is mad believe you'll find it so 'tis likely i'll tell you quickly as i late was angling in the great lake that lies behind the palace from the far shore thick set with reeds and sedges  as patiently i was attending sport i heard a voice a shrill one and attentive i gave my ear when i might well perceive 'twas one that sung and by the smallness of it a boy or woman i then left my angle to his own skill came near but yet perceived not who made the sound the rushes and the reeds had so encompassed it i laid me down and listened to the words she sung for then through a small glade cut by the fishermen i saw it was your daughter she sung much but no sense only i heard her repeat this often palamon is gone is gone to th' wood to gather mulberries i'll find him out tomorrow his shackles will betray him he'll be taken and what shall i do then i'll bring a bevy a hundred black eyed maids that love as i do with chaplets on their heads of daffadillies with cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses and all we'll dance an antic 'fore the duke and beg his pardon then she talked of you sir  that you must lose your head tomorrow morning and she must gather flowers to bury you and see the house made handsome then she sung nothing but willow willow willow and between ever was palamon fair palamon and palamon was a tall young man the place was knee deep where she sat her careless tresses a wreath of bulrush rounded about her stuck thousand freshwater flowers of several colors that methought she appeared like the fair nymph that feeds the lake with waters or as iris newly dropped down from heaven rings she made of rushes that grew by and to 'em spoke the prettiest posies thus our true love's tied this you may lose not me and many a one and then she wept and sung again and sighed and with the same breath smiled and kissed her hand i made in to her she saw me and straight sought the flood i saved her and set her safe to land when presently she slipped away and to the city made with such a cry and swiftness that believe me she left me far behind her three or four i saw from far off cross her one of 'em i knew to be your brother where she stayed and fell scarce to be got away i left them with her and hither came to tell you here they are owgh owgh owgh 'tis up the wind's fair top the bowline out with the main sail where's your whistle master i did think so too and would account i had a great penn'orth on 't to give half my state that both she and i at this present stood unfeignedly on the same terms o very much the maids that kept her company have half persuaded her that i am palamon within this half hour she came smiling to me and asked me what i would eat and when i would kiss her i told her presently and kissed her twice then she told me she would watch with me tonight for well she knew what hour my fit would take me she would have me sing no alas i have no voice sir to confirm her that way why do you think she is not honest sir

where grace was said in any proportion or in any language ay why not grace is grace despite of all controversy as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all grace i grant as there may between the lists and the velvet thou art the list i think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech i will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst i live forget to drink after thee behold behold where madam mitigation comes i have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to  judge a french crown more nay not as one would say healthy but

meet me two hours since and he was ever precise in promise keeping away let's go learn the truth of it why how now claudio whence comes this restraint if i could speak so wisely under an arrest i would send for certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth i had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the mortality of imprisonment what's thy offense claudio what is 't murder lechery a

if myself might be his judge he should receive his punishment in thanks he hath got his friend with child 'tis true i would not though 'tis my familiar sin with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest tongue far from heart play with all virgins so i hold you as a thing enskied and sainted by your renouncement an immortal spirit and to be talked with in sincerity as with a saint do not believe it

plenteous womb expresseth his full tilth and husbandry is she your cousin she it is this is the point the duke is very strangely gone from hence bore many gentlemen myself being one in hand and hope of action but we do learn by those that know the very nerves of state his givings out were of an infinite distance from his true meant design upon his place and with full line of his authority governs lord angelo a man whose blood is very snow broth one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge with profits of the mind study and fast he to give fear to use and liberty which have for long run by the hideous law as mice by lions hath picked out an act under whose heavy sense your brother's life falls into forfeit he arrests him on it and follows close the rigor of the statute to make him an example all hope is gone unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo and that's my pith of business 'twixt you and your poor brother has censured him already and as i hear the provost hath a warrant for 's execution assay the power you have our doubts are traitors and makes us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt go to lord angelo and let him learn to know when maidens sue men give like gods but when they weep and kneel all their petitions are as freely theirs as they themselves would owe them but

allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down they say this angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation is it true think you some report a sea maid spawned him some that he was begot between two stockfishes but it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice that i know to be true and he is a motion generative that's infallible why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man would the duke that is absent have done this ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service and that instructed him to mercy o sir you are deceived who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clack dish the duke had crotchets in him he would be drunk too that let me inform you sir i was an inward of his a shy fellow was the duke and i believe i know the cause of his withdrawing no pardon 'tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips but this i can let you understand the greater file

answered he would never bring them to light would he were returned marry this claudio is condemned for untrussing farewell good friar i prithee pray for me the duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on fridays he's now past it yet and i say to thee  he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic say that i said so farewell good even friar where's the provost o pretty

i do he's a better woodman than thou tak'st him for nay tarry i'll go along with thee i can tell thee pretty tales of the duke i was once before him for getting a wench with child yes marry did i but i was fain to forswear it they would else have married me to the rotten medlar by my troth i'll go with thee to the lane's end if bawdy talk offend you we'll have very little of it nay friar i am a

i help them an not myself let me embrace the sour adversaries for wise men say it is the wisest course my queen and son are gone to france for aid and as i hear the great commanding warwick is thither gone to crave the french king's sister to wife for edward if this news be true poor queen and son your labor is but lost for warwick is a subtle orator and lewis a prince soon won with moving words by this account then margaret may win him for she's a woman to be pitied much her sighs will make a batt'ry in his breast her tears will pierce into a marble heart the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn and nero will be tainted with remorse to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears ay but she's come to beg warwick to give she on his left side craving aid for henry he on his right asking a wife for edward she weeps and says her henry is deposed he smiles and says his edward is installed that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong inferreth arguments of mighty strength and in conclusion wins the king from her with promise of his sister and what else to strengthen and support king edward's place o margaret thus 'twill be and

mind and that's enough my crown is in my heart not on my head not decked with diamonds and indian stones nor to be seen my crown is called content a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy but did you never swear and break an oath where did you dwell when i was king of england i was anointed king at nine months old my father and my grandfather were kings and you were sworn true subjects unto me and tell me then have you not broke your oaths why am i dead do i not breathe a man ah simple men you know not what you swear look as i blow this feather from my face and as the air blows it to me again obeying with my wind when i do blow and yielding to another when it blows commanded always by the greater gust such is the lightness of you common men but do not break your oaths for of that sin my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty go where you will the king shall be commanded and be you kings command and i'll obey so would you be again to henry if he were seated as king edward is in god's name lead your king's name be obeyed and what god will that let your king perform and what he will i humbly yield unto master lieutenant now that god and friends have shaken edward from the regal seat and turned my captive state to liberty my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys at our enlargement what are thy due fees for what lieutenant for well using me nay be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure ay such a pleasure as encag\u00e8d birds conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty  but warwick after god thou sett'st me free and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee he was the author thou the instrument therefore that i may conquer fortune's spite by living low where fortune cannot hurt me and that the people of this bless\u00e8d land may not be punished with my thwarting stars warwick although my head still wear the crown i here resign my government to thee for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds warwick and clarence give me both your hands now join your hands and with your hands your hearts that no dissension hinder government i make you both protectors of this land while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion spend my latter days to sin's rebuke and my creator's praise but with the first of all your chief affairs let me entreat for i command

me his natural brother therefore use thy discretion i had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger and thou wert best look to 't for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not

i know you by description  such garments and such years the boy is fair of female favor and bestows himself like a ripe sister the woman low and browner than her brother are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for orlando doth commend him to you both and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin are you he some of my shame if you will know of me what man i am and how and why and where this handkercher was stained when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour and pacing through the forest chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell he threw his eye aside  and mark what object did present itself under an old oak whose boughs were mossed with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself who with her head nimble in threats approached the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlinked itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bush's shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for 'tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural twice did he turn his back and purposed so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awaked 'twas i but 'tis not i i do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am by and by when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bathed  as how i came into that desert place  in brief he led me to the gentle duke who gave me fresh array and entertainment committing me unto my brother's love who led me instantly unto his cave there stripped himself and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away which all this while had bled and now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind brief i recovered him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind many will swoon when they do look on blood look he recovers be of good cheer youth you a man you lack a man's heart this was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man that will i for i must bear answer back how you excuse my brother rosalind neither call the giddiness of it in question the poverty of her the small acquaintance my sudden wooing nor her sudden consenting but say with me i love aliena say with her that she loves me consent with both that we may enjoy each other it shall be to your

reckless and fearless of what's past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all

afternoon and how shall we continue claudio to save me from the danger that might come if he were known alive i am your free dependent here is the head i'll carry it myself i'll make all speed it was commanded so no my good lord it was by private message pardon me noble lord i thought it was a fault but knew it not yet did repent me after more advice for testimony whereof one in the prison that

master brook you come to know what hath passed between me and ford's wife master brook i will not lie to you i was at her house the hour she appointed me very ill favoredly master brook no master brook but the peaking cornuto her husband master brook dwelling in a continual 'larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of our encounter after we had embraced kissed protested and as it were spoke the prologue of our comedy and at his heels a rabble of his companions thither provoked and instigated by his distemper and forsooth to search his house for his wife's love while i was there you shall hear as good luck would have it comes in one mistress page gives intelligence of ford's approach and in her invention and ford's wife's distraction they conveyed me into a buck basket by the lord a buck basket rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy napkins that master brook there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril nay you shall hear master brook what i have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good being thus crammed in the basket a couple of ford's knaves his hinds were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to datchet lane they took me on their shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the door who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket i quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it but fate ordaining he should be a cuckold held his hand well on went he for a search and away went i for foul clothes but mark the sequel master brook i suffered the pangs of three several deaths first an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bellwether next to be compassed like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head and then to be stopped in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease think of that a man of my kidney think of that that am as subject to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution and thaw it was a miracle to 'scape suffocation and in the height of this bath when i was more than half stewed in grease like a dutch dish to be thrown into the thames and cooled glowing hot in that surge like a horseshoe think of that hissing hot think of that master brook master brook i will be thrown into etna as i have been into thames ere i will leave her thus her husband is this morning gone a birding i have received from her another embassy of meeting 'twixt eight and nine is the hour master brook is it i will then address me to my appointment come to me at your convenient leisure and you shall know how i speed and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her adieu you shall have her master brook master brook you shall cuckold ford mistress ford your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance i see you are obsequious in your love and i profess requital to a hair's breadth not only mistress ford in the simple office of love but in all the accoutrement compliment and ceremony of it but are you sure of your husband now no i'll come no more i' th' basket may i not go out ere he come what shall i do i'll creep up into the chimney where is it i'll go out then good hearts devise something any extremity rather than a mischief how now mine host there was mine host an old fat woman even now with me but she's gone ay marry was it mussel shell what would you with her i spake with the old woman about it marry she says that the very same man that beguiled master slender of his chain cozened him of it what are they let us know 'tis 'tis his fortune to have her or no go say the woman told me so ay sir like who more bold ay that there was mine host one that hath taught me more wit than ever i learned before in my life and i paid nothing for it neither but was paid for my learning i would all the world might be cozened for i have been cozened and beaten too if it should come to the ear of the court how i have been transformed and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgeled they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me i warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till i were as crestfallen as a dried pear i never prospered since i forswore myself at primero well if my wind were but long enough i would repent now whence come you the devil take one party and his dam the other and so they shall be both bestowed i have suffered more for their sakes more than the villainous inconstancy of man's disposition is able to bear what tell'st thou me of black and blue i was beaten myself into all the colors of the rainbow and i was like to be apprehended for the witch of brentford but that my admirable dexterity of wit my counterfeiting the action of an old woman delivered me the knave constable had set me i' th' stocks i' th' common stocks for a witch come up into my chamber prithee no more prattling go i'll hold this is the third time i hope good luck lies in odd numbers away go they say there is divinity in odd numbers either in nativity chance or death away away i say time wears hold up your head and mince how now master brook master brook the matter will be known tonight or never be you in the park about midnight at herne's oak and you shall see wonders i went to her master brook as you see like a poor old man but i came from her master brook

which stains the stony entrance of this sepulcher what mean these masterless and gory swords to lie discolored by this place of peace romeo o pale who else what paris too and steeped in blood ah what an unkind hour is guilty of this lamentable chance the lady stirs i hear some noise lady come from that nest of death contagion and unnatural sleep a greater power than we can contradict hath thwarted our intents come come away thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead and paris too come i'll dispose of thee among a sisterhood of holy nuns stay not to question for the watch is coming come go good juliet i dare no longer stay i am the greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murder and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemn\u00e8d and myself excused i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeo's faithful wife i married them and their stol'n marriage day was tybalt's doomsday whose untimely death banished the new made bridegroom from this city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined you to remove that siege of grief from her betrothed and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutored by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave being the time the potion's force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stayed by accident and yesternight returned my letter back then all alone at the prefix\u00e8d hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred's vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awakening here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificed some hour before his time unto the rigor of severest law", "H5_Burgundy": "my duty to you both on equal love great kings of france and england that i have labored with all my wits my pains and strong endeavors to bring your most imperial majesties unto this bar and royal interview your mightiness on both parts best can witness since then my office hath so far prevailed that face to face and royal eye to eye you have congreeted let it not disgrace me if i demand before this royal view what rub or what impediment there is why that the naked poor and mangled peace dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births should not in this best garden of the world our fertile france put up her lovely visage alas she hath from france too long been chased and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps corrupting in its own fertility her vine the merry cheerer of the heart unprun\u00e8d dies her hedges even pleached like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair put forth disordered twigs her fallow leas the darnel hemlock and rank fumitory doth root upon while that the coulter rusts that should deracinate such savagery the even mead that erst brought sweetly forth the freckled cowslip burnet and green clover wanting the scythe withal uncorrected rank conceives by idleness and nothing teems but hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burrs losing both beauty and utility and all our vineyards fallows meads and hedges defective in their natures grow to wildness even so our houses and ourselves and children have lost or do not learn for want of time the sciences that should become our country but grow like savages as soldiers will that nothing do but meditate on blood to swearing and stern looks diffused attire and everything that seems unnatural which to reduce into our former favor you are assembled and my speech entreats that i may know the let why gentle peace should not expel these inconveniences and bless us with her former qualities the king hath heard them to the which as yet there is no answer made god save your majesty my royal cousin teach you our princess english is she not apt pardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you for that if you would conjure in her you must make a circle if conjure up love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked and blind can you blame her then being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self it were my lord a hard condition for a maid to consign to they are then excused my lord when they see not what they do i will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach her to know my meaning for maids well summered and warm kept are like flies at bartholomew tide blind though they have their eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not abide looking on as love is my lord before it loves amen", "Mac_Ross": "god save the king from fife great king where the norweyan banners flout the sky and fan our people cold norway himself with terrible numbers assisted by that most disloyal traitor the thane of cawdor began a dismal conflict till that bellona's bridegroom lapped in proof confronted him with self comparisons point against point rebellious arm 'gainst arm curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude the victory fell on us that now sweno the norways' king craves composition nor would we deign him burial of his men till he disburs\u00e8d at saint colme's inch ten thousand dollars to our general use i'll see it done the king hath happily received macbeth the news of thy success and when he reads thy personal venture in the rebels' fight his wonders and his praises do contend which should be thine or his silenced with that in viewing o'er the rest o' th' selfsame day he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks nothing afeard of what thyself didst make strange images of death as thick as tale came post with post and every one did bear thy praises in his kingdom's great defense and poured them down before him and for an earnest of a greater honor he bade me from him call thee thane of cawdor in which addition hail most worthy thane for it is thine so all well contented ha good father thou seest the heavens as troubled with man's act threatens his bloody stage by th' clock 'tis day and yet dark night strangles the

blame upon his promise please 't your highness to grace us with your royal company gentlemen rise his highness is not well what sights my lord you must have patience madam you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear my dearest coz i pray you school yourself but for your husband he is noble wise judicious and best knows the fits o' th' season i dare not speak much further but cruel are the times when we are traitors and do not know ourselves when we hold rumor from what we fear yet know not what we fear but float upon a wild and violent sea each way and move i take my leave of you shall not be long but i'll be here again things at the worst will cease or else climb upward to what they were before my pretty cousin blessing upon you i am so much a fool should i stay longer it would be my disgrace and your discomfort i take my leave at once sir amen alas poor country almost afraid to know itself it cannot be called our mother but our grave where nothing but who knows nothing is once seen to smile where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air are made not marked where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy the dead man's knell is there scarce asked for who and good men's lives expire before the flowers in their caps dying or ere they sicken that of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker each minute teems a new one why well well too no they were well at peace when i did leave 'em when i came hither to transport the tidings which i have heavily borne there ran a rumor of many worthy fellows that were out which was to my belief witnessed the rather for that i saw the tyrant's power afoot now is the time of help your eye in scotland would create soldiers make our women fight to doff their dire distresses would i could answer this comfort with the like but i have words that would be howled out in the desert air where hearing should not latch them no mind that's honest but in it shares some woe though the main part pertains to you alone let not your ears despise my tongue forever which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard your castle is surprised your wife and babes savagely slaughtered to relate the manner were on the quarry of these murdered deer to add the death of you wife children servants all that could be found i have said your son my lord has paid a soldier's debt he only lived but till he was a man the which no sooner had his prowess confirmed in the unshrinking station where he fought but like a man he died ay and brought off the field your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth for then it hath no end ay on the front hail king of scotland"}
