now daughter sylvia you are hard beset  sir valentine your father is in good health what say you to a letter from your friends of much good news know you don antonio your countryman hath he not a son you know him well beshrew me sir but if he make this good he is as worthy for an empress' love as meet to be an emperor's counselor well sir this gentleman is come to me with commendation from great potentates and here he means to spend his time awhile i think 'tis no unwelcome news to you welcome him then according to his worth sylvia i speak to you and you sir thurio for valentine i need not cite him to it i will send him hither to you presently sir thurio give us leave i pray awhile we have some secrets to confer about now tell me proteus what's your will with me proteus i thank thee for thine honest care which to requite command me while i live this love of theirs myself have often seen haply when they have judged me fast asleep and oftentimes have purposed to forbid sir valentine her company and my court but fearing lest my jealous aim might err and so unworthily disgrace the man  a rashness that i ever yet have shunned  i gave him gentle looks thereby to find that which thyself hast now disclosed to me and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this knowing that tender youth is soon suggested i nightly lodge her in an upper tower the key whereof myself have ever kept and thence she cannot be conveyed away upon mine honor he shall never know that i had any light from thee of this sir valentine whither away so fast be they of much import nay then no matter stay with me awhile i am to break with thee of some affairs that touch me near wherein thou must be secret 'tis not unknown to thee that i have sought to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter no trust me she is peevish sullen froward proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty neither regarding that she is my child nor fearing me as if i were her father and may i say to thee this pride of hers upon advice hath drawn my love from her and where i thought the remnant of mine age should have been cherished by her childlike duty i now am full resolved to take a wife and turn her out to who will take her in then let her beauty be her wedding dower for me and my possessions she esteems not there is a lady in verona here whom i affect but she is nice and coy and nought esteems my agèd eloquence now therefore would i have thee to my tutor  for long agone i have forgot to court besides the fashion of the time is changed  how and which way i may bestow myself to be regarded in her sun bright eye but she did scorn a present that i sent her but she i mean is promised by her friends unto a youthful gentleman of worth and kept severely from resort of men that no man hath access by day to her ay but the doors be locked and keys kept safe that no man hath recourse to her by night her chamber is aloft far from the ground and built so shelving that one cannot climb it without apparent hazard of his life now as thou art a gentleman of blood advise me where i may have such a ladder this very night for love is like a child that longs for everything that he can come by but hark thee i will go to her alone how shall i best convey the ladder thither a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn then let me see thy cloak i'll get me one of such another length how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak i pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me what letter is this same what's here to sylvia and here an engine fit for my proceeding i'll be so bold to break the seal for once my thoughts do harbor with my sylvia nightly and slaves they are to me that send them flying o could their master come and go as lightly himself would lodge where senseless they are lying my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them while i their king that thither them importune do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them because myself do want my servants' fortune i curse myself for they are sent by me that they should harbor where their lord should be what's here sylvia this night i will enfranchise thee 'tis so and here's the ladder for the purpose why phaëton for thou art merops' son  wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car and with thy daring folly burn the world wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee go base intruder overweening slave bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates and think my patience more than thy desert is privilege for thy departure hence thank me for this more than for all the favors which all too much i have bestowed on thee but if thou linger in my territories longer than swiftest expedition will give thee time to leave our royal court by heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love i ever bore my daughter or thyself begone i will not hear thy vain excuse but as thou lov'st thy life make speed from hence sir thurio fear not but that she will love you now valentine is banished from her sight this weak impress of love is as a figure trenchèd in ice which with an hour's heat dissolves to water and doth lose his form a little time will melt her frozen thoughts and worthless valentine shall be forgot how now sir proteus is your countryman according to our proclamation gone my daughter takes his going grievously so i believe but thurio thinks not so proteus the good conceit i hold of thee for thou hast shown some sign of good desert makes me the better to confer with thee thou know'st how willingly i would effect the match between sir thurio and my daughter and also i think thou art not ignorant how she opposes her against my will ay and perversely she persevers so what might we do to make the girl forget the love of valentine and love sir thurio ay but she'll think that it is spoke in hate then you must undertake to slander him where your good word cannot advantage him your slander never can endamage him therefore the office is indifferent being entreated to it by your friend and proteus we dare trust you in this kind because we know on valentine's report you are already love's firm votary and cannot soon revolt and change your mind upon this warrant shall you have access where you with sylvia may confer at large  for she is lumpish heavy melancholy and for your friend's sake will be glad of you  where you may temper her by your persuasion to hate young valentine and love my friend ay much is the force of heaven bred poesy this discipline shows thou hast been in love about it gentlemen even now about it i will pardon you how now sir proteus how now thurio which of you saw eglamour of late saw you my daughter why then she's fled unto that peasant valentine and eglamour is in her company 'tis true for friar lawrence met them both as he in penance wandered through the forest him he knew well and guessed that it was she but being masked he was not sure of it besides she did intend confession at patrick's cell this even and there she was not these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence therefore i pray you stand not to discourse but mount you presently and meet with me upon the rising of the mountain foot that leads toward mantua whither they are fled dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me sir valentine the more degenerate and base art thou to make such means for her as thou hast done and leave her on such slight conditions  now by the honor of my ancestry i do applaud thy spirit valentine and think thee worthy of an empress' love know then i here forget all former griefs cancel all grudge repeal thee home again plead a new state in thy unrivaled merit to which i thus subscribe sir valentine thou art a gentleman and well derived take thou thy sylvia for thou hast deserved her i grant it for thine own whate'er it be thou hast prevailed i pardon them and thee dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts come let us go we will include all jars with triumphs mirth and rare solemnity i think the boy hath grace in him he blushes what mean you by that saying
