trick i'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered and give them to a dog for a new year's gift 'sblood the rogues slighted me into the river with as little remorse as they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies fifteen i' th' litter and you may know by my size that i have a kind of alacrity in sinking if the bottom were as deep as hell i should down i had been drowned but that the shore was shelvy and shallow a death that i abhor for the water swells a man and what a thing should i have been when i had been swelled by the lord i should have been a mountain of mummy come let me pour in some sack to the thames water for my belly's as cold as if i had swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the reins call her in take away these chalices go brew me a pottle of sack finely simple of itself i'll no pullet sperm in my brewage how now mistress ford i have had ford enough i was thrown into the ford i have my belly full of ford so did i mine to build upon a foolish woman's promise well i will visit her tell her so and bid her think what a man is let her consider his frailty and then judge of my merit do so between nine and ten say'st thou well be gone i will not miss her i marvel i hear not of master brook he sent me word to stay within i like his money well o here he comes now master brook you come to know what hath passed between me and ford's wife master brook i will not lie to you i was at her house the hour she appointed me very ill favoredly master brook no master brook but the peaking cornuto her husband master brook dwelling in a continual 'larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of our encounter after we had embraced kissed protested and as it were spoke the prologue of our comedy and at his heels a rabble of his companions thither provoked and instigated by his distemper and forsooth to search his house for his wife's love while i was there you shall hear as good luck would have it comes in one mistress page gives intelligence of ford's approach and in her invention and ford's wife's distraction they conveyed me into a buck basket by the lord a buck basket rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy napkins that master brook there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril nay you shall hear master brook what i have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good being thus crammed in the basket a couple of ford's knaves his hinds were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to datchet lane they took me on their shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the door who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket i quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it but fate ordaining he should be a cuckold held his hand well on went he for a search and away went i for foul clothes but mark the sequel master brook i suffered the pangs of three several deaths first an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bellwether next to be compassed like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head and then to be stopped in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease think of that a man of my kidney think of that that am as subject to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution and thaw it was a miracle to 'scape suffocation and in the height of this bath when i was more than half stewed in grease like a dutch dish to be thrown into the thames and cooled glowing hot in that surge like a horseshoe think of that hissing hot think of that master brook master brook i will be thrown into etna as i have been into thames ere i will leave her thus her husband is this morning gone a birding i have received from her another embassy of meeting 'twixt eight and nine is the hour master brook is it i will then address me to my appointment come to me at your convenient leisure and you shall know how i speed and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her adieu you shall have her master brook master brook you shall cuckold ford mistress ford your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance i see you are obsequious in your love and i profess requital to a hair's breadth not only mistress ford in the simple office of love but in all the accoutrement compliment and ceremony of it but are you sure of your husband now no i'll come no more i' th' basket may i not go out ere he come what shall i do i'll creep up into the chimney where is it i'll go out then good hearts devise something any extremity rather than a mischief how now mine host there was mine host an old fat woman even now with me but she's gone ay marry was it mussel shell what would you with her i spake with the old woman about it marry she says that the very same man that beguiled master slender of his chain cozened him of it what are they let us know 'tis 'tis his fortune to have her or no go say the woman told me so ay sir like who more bold ay that there was mine host one that hath taught me more wit than ever i learned before in my life and i paid nothing for it neither but was paid for my learning i would all the world might be cozened for i have been cozened and beaten too if it should come to the ear of the court how i have been transformed and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgeled they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me i warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till i were as crestfallen as a dried pear i never prospered since i forswore myself at primero well if my wind were but long enough i would repent now whence come you the devil take one party and his dam the other and so they shall be both bestowed i have suffered more for their sakes more than the villainous inconstancy of man's disposition is able to bear what tell'st thou me of black and blue i was beaten myself into all the colors of the rainbow and i was like to be apprehended for the witch of brentford but that my admirable dexterity of wit my counterfeiting the action of an old woman delivered me the knave constable had set me i' th' stocks i' th' common stocks for a witch come up into my chamber prithee no more prattling go i'll hold this is the third time i hope good luck lies in odd numbers away go they say there is divinity in odd numbers either in nativity chance or death away away i say time wears hold up your head and mince how now master brook master brook the matter will be known tonight or never be you in the park about midnight at herne's oak and you shall see wonders i went to her master brook as you see like a poor old man but i came from her master brook like a poor old woman that same knave ford her husband hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him master brook that ever governed frenzy i will tell you he beat me grievously in the shape of a woman for in the shape of man master brook i fear not goliath with a weaver's beam because i know also life is a shuttle i am in haste go along with me i'll tell you all master brook since i plucked geese played truant and whipped top i knew not what 'twas to be beaten till lately follow me i'll tell you strange things of this knave ford on whom tonight i will be revenged and i will deliver his wife into your hand follow strange things in hand master brook follow the windsor bell hath struck twelve the minute draws on now the hot blooded gods assist me remember jove thou wast a bull for thy europa love set on thy horns o powerful love that in some respects makes a beast a man in some other a man a beast you were also jupiter a swan for the love of leda o omnipotent love how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose a fault done first in the form of a beast o jove a beastly fault and then another fault in the semblance of a fowl think on 't jove a foul fault when gods have hot backs what shall poor men do for me i am here a windsor stag and the fattest i think i' th' forest send me a cool rut time jove or who can blame me to piss my tallow who comes here my doe my doe with the black scut let the sky rain potatoes let it thunder to the tune of greensleeves hail kissing comfits and snow eryngoes let there come a tempest of provocation i will shelter me here divide me like a bribed buck each a haunch i will keep my sides to myself my shoulders for the fellow of this walk and my horns i bequeath your husbands am i a woodman ha speak i like herne the hunter why now is cupid a child of conscience he makes restitution as i am a true spirit welcome what should this be i think the devil will not have me damned lest the oil that's in me should set hell on fire he would never else cross me thus they are fairies he that speaks to them shall die i'll wink and couch no man their works must eye heavens defend me from that welsh fairy lest he transform me to a piece of cheese o o o i do begin to perceive that i am made an ass and these are not fairies i was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies and yet the guiltiness of my mind the sudden surprise of my powers drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason that they were fairies see now how wit may be made a jack a lent when 'tis upon ill employment have i laid my brain in the sun and dried it that it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as this am i ridden with a welsh goat too shall i have a coxcomb of frieze 'tis time i were choked with a piece of toasted cheese seese and putter have i lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of english this is enough to be the decay of lust and late walking through the realm well i am your theme you have the start of me i am dejected i am not able to answer the welsh flannel ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me use me as you will i am glad though you have ta'en a special stand to strike at me that your arrow hath glanced when night dogs run all sorts of deer are chased
