were you in doubt sir that you asked her if signior leonato be her father she would not have his head on her shoulders for all messina as like him as she is what my dear lady disdain are you yet living then is courtesy a turncoat but it is certain i am loved of all ladies only you excepted and i would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard heart for truly i love none god keep your ladyship still in that mind so some gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate scratched face well you are a rare parrot teacher i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer but keep your way i' god's name i have done i noted her not but i looked on her do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex why i' faith methinks she's too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation i can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is i do not like her would you buy her that you enquire after her yea and a case to put it into but speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting jack to tell us cupid is a good hare finder and vulcan a rare carpenter come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song i can see yet without spectacles and i see no such matter there's her cousin an she were not possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of may doth the last of december but i hope you have no intent to turn husband have you is 't come to this in faith hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion shall i never see a bachelor of threescore again go to i' faith an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away sundays look don pedro is returned to seek you i would your grace would constrain me to tell you hear count claudio i can be secret as a dumb man i would have you think so but on my allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is in love with who now that is your grace's part mark how short his answer is with hero leonato's short daughter like the old tale my lord it is not so nor 'twas not so but indeed god forbid it should be so and by my two faiths and troths my lord i spoke mine that i neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me i will die in it at the stake that a woman conceived me i thank her that she brought me up i likewise give her most humble thanks but that i will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me because i will not do them the wrong to mistrust any i will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is for the which i may go the finer i will live a bachelor with anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love prove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a ballad maker's pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind cupid if i do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on the shoulder and called adam the savage bull may but if ever the sensible benedick bear it pluck off the bull's horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write here is good horse to hire let them signify under my sign here you may see benedick the married man i look for an earthquake too then i have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and so i commit you  nay mock not mock not the body of your discourse is sometimes guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further examine your conscience and so i leave you well i would you did like me which is one i love you the better the hearers may cry amen no you shall pardon me not now what's he not i believe me i pray you what is he when i know the gentleman i'll tell him what you say in every good thing count claudio come will you go with me even to the next willow about your own business county what fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck like an usurer's chain or under your arm like a lieutenant's scarf you must wear it one way for the prince hath got your hero why that's spoken like an honest drover so they sell bullocks but did you think the prince would have served you thus ho now you strike like the blind man 'twas the boy that stole your meat and you'll beat the post alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges but that my lady beatrice should know me and not know me the prince's fool ha it may be i go under that title because i am merry yea but so i am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out well i'll be revenged as i may troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren i told him and i think i told him true that your grace had got the goodwill of this young lady and i offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped the flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyed with finding a bird's nest shows it his companion and he steals it yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as i take it have stolen his bird's nest if their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly o she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her she told me not thinking i had been myself that i was the prince's jester that i was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me she speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star i would not marry her though she were endowed with all that adam had left him before he transgressed she would have made hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal ate in good apparel i would to god some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follows her will your grace command me any service to the world's end i will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on i will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of asia bring you the length of prester john's foot fetch you a hair off the great cham's beard do you any embassage to the pygmies rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy you have no employment for me o god sir here's a dish i love not i cannot endure my lady tongue boy in my chamber window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard i know that but i would have thee hence and here again i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is claudio i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes may i be so converted and see with these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but i'll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich she shall be that's certain wise or i'll none virtuous or i'll never cheapen her fair or i'll never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not i for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what color it please god ha the prince and monsieur love i will hide me in the arbor now divine air now is his soul ravished is it not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out of men's bodies well a horn for my money when all's done an he had been a dog that should have howled thus they would have hanged him and i pray god his bad voice bode no mischief i had as lief have heard the night raven come what plague could have come after it is 't possible sits the wind in that corner i should think this a gull but that the white bearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide himself in such reverence this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent love me why it must be requited i hear how i am censured they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is fair 'tis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous 'tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horribly in love with her i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor no the world must be peopled when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married here comes beatrice by this day she's a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in her fair beatrice i thank you for your pains you take pleasure then in the message ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner there's a double meaning in that i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me that's as much as to say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i am a jew i will go get her picture gallants i am not as i have been i have the toothache hang it well everyone can master a grief but he that has it yet is this no charm for the toothache  old signior walk aside with me i have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobby horses must not hear how now interjections why then some be of laughing as ah ha he this looks not like a nuptial how doth the lady sir sir be patient for my part i am so attired in wonder i know not what to say lady were you her bedfellow last night two of them have the very bent of honor and if their wisdoms be misled in this the practice of it lives in john the bastard whose spirits toil in frame of villainies signior leonato let the friar advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio yet by mine honor i will deal in this as secretly and justly as your soul should with your body lady beatrice have you wept all this while i will not desire that surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged is there any way to show such friendship may a man do it i do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that strange by my sword beatrice thou lovest me i will swear by it that you love me and i will make him eat it that says i love not you with no sauce that can be devised to it i protest i love thee what offense sweet beatrice and do it with all thy heart come bid me do anything for thee ha not for the wide world tarry sweet beatrice beatrice  we'll be friends first is claudio thine enemy hear me beatrice  nay but beatrice  beat  tarry good beatrice by this hand i love thee think you in your soul the count claudio hath wronged hero enough i am engaged i will challenge him i will kiss your hand and so i leave you by this hand claudio shall render me a dear account as you hear of me so think of me go comfort your cousin i must say she is dead and so farewell good day my lord in a false quarrel there is no true valor i came to seek you both it is in my scabbard shall i draw it sir i shall meet your wit in the career an you charge it against me i pray you choose another subject shall i speak a word in your ear you are a villain i jest not i will make it good how you dare with what you dare and when you dare do me right or i will protest your cowardice you have killed a sweet lady and her death shall fall heavy on you let me hear from you sir your wit ambles well it goes easily fare you well boy you know my mind i will leave you now to your gossip like humor you break jests as braggarts do their blades which god be thanked hurt not my lord for your many courtesies i thank you i must discontinue your company your brother the bastard is fled from messina you have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady for my lord lackbeard there he and i shall meet and till then peace be with him pray thee sweet mistress margaret deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of beatrice in so high a style margaret that no man living shall come over it for in most comely truth thou deservest it thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth it catches a most manly wit margaret it will not hurt a woman and so i pray thee call beatrice i give thee the bucklers if you use them margaret you must put in the pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids and therefore will come the god of love that sits above and knows me and knows me how pitiful i deserve  i mean in singing but in loving leander the good swimmer troilus the first employer of panders and a whole book full of these quondam carpetmongers whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse why they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love marry i cannot show it in rhyme i have tried i can find out no rhyme to lady but baby an innocent rhyme for scorn horn a hard rhyme for school fool a babbling rhyme very ominous endings no i was not born under a rhyming planet nor i cannot woo in festival terms sweet beatrice wouldst thou come when i called thee o stay but till then only foul words and thereupon i will kiss thee thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense so forcible is thy wit but i must tell thee plainly claudio undergoes my challenge and either i must shortly hear from him or i will subscribe him a coward and i pray thee now tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me suffer love a good epithet i do suffer love indeed for i love thee against my will thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably an old an old instance beatrice that lived in the time of good neighbors if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps question why an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum therefore is it most expedient for the wise if don worm his conscience find no impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his own virtues as i am to myself so much for praising myself who i myself will bear witness is praiseworthy and now tell me how doth your cousin and how do you serve god love me and mend there will i leave you too for here comes one in haste i will live in thy heart die in thy lap and be buried in thy eyes and moreover i will go with thee to thy uncle's and so am i being else by faith enforced to call young claudio to a reckoning for it friar i must entreat your pains i think to bind me or undo me one of them  signior leonato truth it is good signior your niece regards me with an eye of favor and i do with an eye of love requite her your answer sir is enigmatical but for my will my will is your goodwill may stand with ours this day to be conjoined in the state of honorable marriage  in which good friar i shall desire your help bull jove sir had an amiable low and some such strange bull leapt your father's cow and got a calf in that same noble feat much like to you for you have just his bleat soft and fair friar which is beatrice do not you love me why then your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived they swore you did troth no no more than reason they swore that you were almost sick for me 'tis no such matter then you do not love me a miracle here's our own hands against our hearts come i will have thee but by this light i take thee for pity peace i will stop your mouth i'll tell thee what prince a college of wit crackers cannot flout me out of my humor dost thou think i care for a satire or an epigram no if a man will be beaten with brains he shall wear nothing handsome about him in brief since i do purpose to marry i will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it and therefore never flout at me for what i have said against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my conclusion for thy part claudio i did think to have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my kinsman live unbruised and love my cousin come come we are friends let's have a dance ere we are married that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives' heels first of my word therefore play music  prince thou art sad get thee a wife get thee a wife there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn think not on him till tomorrow i'll devise thee brave punishments for him strike up pipers
