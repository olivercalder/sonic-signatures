i can but say their protestation over so much dear liege i have already sworn that is to live and study here three years but there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term which i hope well is not enrollèd there and one day in a week to touch no food and but one meal on every day besides the which i hope is not enrollèd there and then to sleep but three hours in the night and not be seen to wink of all the day  when i was wont to think no harm all night and make a dark night too of half the day  which i hope well is not enrollèd there o these are barren tasks too hard to keep not to see ladies study fast not sleep let me say no my liege an if you please i only swore to study with your grace and stay here in your court for three years' space by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest what is the end of study let me know things hid and barred you mean from common sense come on then i will swear to study so to know the thing i am forbid to know as thus to study where i well may dine when i to feast expressly am forbid or study where to meet some mistress fine when mistresses from common sense are hid or having sworn too hard a keeping oath study to break it and not break my troth if study's gain be thus and this be so study knows that which yet it doth not know swear me to this and i will ne'er say no why all delights are vain and that most vain which with pain purchased doth inherit pain as painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth while truth the while doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look light seeking light doth light of light beguile so ere you find where light in darkness lies your light grows dark by losing of your eyes study me how to please the eye indeed by fixing it upon a fairer eye who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed and give him light that it was blinded by study is like the heaven's glorious sun that will not be deep searched with saucy looks small have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others' books these earthly godfathers of heaven's lights that give a name to every fixèd star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and wot not what they are too much to know is to know naught but fame and every godfather can give a name the spring is near when green geese are a breeding fit in his place and time something then in rhyme well say i am why should proud summer boast before the birds have any cause to sing why should i joy in any abortive birth at christmas i no more desire a rose than wish a snow in may's new fangled shows but like of each thing that in season grows so you to study now it is too late climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you and though i have for barbarism spoke more than for that angel knowledge you can say yet confident i'll keep what i have sworn and bide the penance of each three years' day give me the paper let me read the same and to the strictest decrees i'll write my name item that no woman shall come within a mile of my court hath this been proclaimed let's see the penalty on pain of losing her tongue who devised this penalty sweet lord and why a dangerous law against gentility item if any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possible devise this article my liege yourself must break for well you know here comes in embassy the french king's daughter with yourself to speak  a maid of grace and complete majesty  about surrender up of aquitaine to her decrepit sick and bedrid father therefore this article is made in vain or vainly comes th' admirèd princess hither so study evermore is overshot while it doth study to have what it would it doth forget to do the thing it should and when it hath the thing it hunteth most 'tis won as towns with fire so won so lost necessity will make us all forsworn three thousand times within this three years' space for every man with his affects is born not by might mastered but by special grace if i break faith this word shall speak for me i am forsworn on mere necessity so to the laws at large i write my name and he that breaks them in the least degree stands in attainder of eternal shame suggestions are to other as to me but i believe although i seem so loath i am the last that will last keep his oath but is there no quick recreation granted armado is a most illustrious wight a man of fire new words fashion's own knight this fellow what wouldst this is he how low soever the matter i hope in god for high words to hear or forbear hearing well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness in what manner for the following sir as we would hear an oracle this is not so well as i looked for but the best that ever i heard it is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin i'll lay my head to any goodman's hat these oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn sirrah come on

heedfully o'ereye more sacks to the mill o heavens i have my wish dumaine transformed four woodcocks in a dish o most profane coxcomb by earth she is not corporal there you lie an amber colored raven

saucers sweet misprision once more i'll mark how love can vary wit now step i forth to whip hypocrisy ah good my liege i pray thee pardon me good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove these worms for loving that art most in love your eyes do make no coaches in your tears there is no certain princess that appears you'll not be perjured 'tis a hateful thing tush none but minstrels like of sonneting but are you not ashamed nay are you not all three of you to be thus much o'ershot you found his mote the king your mote did see but i a beam do find in each of three o what a scene of fool'ry have i seen of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen o me with what strict patience have i sat to see a king transformèd to a gnat to see great hercules whipping a gig and profound solomon to tune a jig and nestor play at pushpin with the boys and critic timon laugh at idle toys where lies thy grief o tell me good dumaine and gentle longaville where lies thy pain and where my liege's all about the breast a caudle ho not you to me but i betrayed by you i that am honest i that hold it sin to break the vow i am engagèd in i am betrayed by keeping company with men like you men of inconstancy when shall you see me write a thing in rhyme or groan for joan or spend a minute's time in pruning me when shall you hear that i will praise a hand a foot a face an eye a gait a state a brow a breast a waist a leg a limb  i post from love good lover let me go a toy my liege a toy your grace needs not fear it ah you whoreson loggerhead you were born to do me shame  guilty my lord guilty i confess i confess that you three fools lacked me fool to make up the mess he he and you and you my liege and i are pickpurses in love and we deserve to die o dismiss this audience and i shall tell you more true true we are four will these turtles be gone sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace as true we are as flesh and blood can be the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face young blood doth not obey an old decree we cannot cross the cause why we were born therefore of all hands must we be forsworn did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline that like a rude and savage man of ind at the first op'ning of the gorgeous east bows not his vassal head and strucken blind kisses the base ground with obedient breast what peremptory eagle sighted eye dares look upon the heaven of her brow that is not blinded by her majesty my eyes are then no eyes nor i berowne o but for my love day would turn to night of all complexions the culled sovereignty do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek where several worthies make one dignity where nothing wants that want itself doth seek lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues  fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not to things of sale a seller's praise belongs she passes praise then praise too short doth blot a withered hermit fivescore winters worn might shake off fifty looking in her eye beauty doth varnish age as if newborn and gives the crutch the cradle's infancy o 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine is ebony like her o word divine a wife of such wood were felicity o who can give an oath where is a book that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack if that she learn not of her eye to look no face is fair that is not full so black devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light o if in black my lady's brows be decked it mourns that painting and usurping hair should ravish doters with a false aspect and therefore is she born to make black fair her favor turns the fashion of the days for native blood is counted painting now and therefore red that would avoid dispraise paints itself black to imitate her brow your mistresses dare never come in rain for fear their colors should be washed away i'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here o if the streets were pavèd with thine eyes her feet were much too dainty for such tread nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn o 'tis more than need have at you then affection's men at arms o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beauty's tutors have enriched you with other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practicers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learnèd in a lady's eyes lives not alone immurèd in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind a lover's ear will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stopped love's feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockled snails love's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste for valor is not love a hercules still climbing trees in the hesperides subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical as bright apollo's lute strung with his hair and when love speaks the voice of all the gods make heaven drowsy with the harmony never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were tempered with love's sighs o then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility from women's eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in ought proves excellent then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools for wisdom's sake a word that all men love or for love's sake a word that loves all men or for men's sake the authors of these women or women's sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths it is religion to be thus forsworn for charity itself fulfills the law and who can sever love from charity advance your standards and upon them lords pell mell down with them but be first advised in conflict that you get the sun of them first from the park let us conduct them thither then homeward every man attach the hand of his fair mistress in the afternoon we will with some strange pastime solace them such as the shortness of the time can shape for revels dances masques and merry hours forerun fair love strewing her way with flowers allons allons sowed cockle reaped no corn and justice always whirls in equal measure light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn if so our copper buys no better treasure their eyes villain their eyes once to behold rogue is this your perfectness begone you rogue nothing but peace and gentle visitation tell her we measure them by weary steps we number nothing that we spend for you our duty is so rich so infinite that we may do it still without account vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face that we like savages may worship it white handed mistress one sweet word with thee nay then two treys an if you grow so nice metheglin wort and malmsey well run dice there's half a dozen sweets one word in secret thou grievest my gall therefore meet by heaven all dry beaten with pure scoff this fellow pecks up wit as pigeons peas and utters it again when god doth please he is wit's peddler and retails his wares at wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs and we that sell by gross the lord doth know have not the grace to grace it with such show this gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve had he been adam he had tempted eve he can carve too and lisp why this is he that kissed his hand away in courtesy this is the ape of form monsieur the nice that when he plays at tables chides the dice in honorable terms nay he can sing a mean most meanly and in ushering mend him who can the ladies call him sweet the stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet this is the flower that smiles on everyone to show his teeth as white as whale's bone and consciences that will not die in debt pay him the due of honey tongued boyet see where it comes behavior what wert thou till this madman showed thee and what art thou now this jest is dry to me gentle sweet your wits makes wise things foolish when we greet with eyes' best seeing heaven's fiery eye by light we lose light your capacity is of that nature that to your huge store wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor i am a fool and full of poverty o i am yours and all that i possess i cannot give you less where when what vizard why demand you this thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury can any face of brass hold longer out here stand i lady dart thy skill at me bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit and i will wish thee nevermore to dance nor nevermore in russian habit wait o never will i trust to speeches penned nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue nor never come in vizard to my friend nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper's song taffeta phrases silken terms precise three piled hyperboles spruce affectation figures pedantical these summer flies have blown me full of maggot ostentation i do forswear them and i here protest by this white glove how white the hand god knows  henceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed in russet yeas and honest kersey noes and to begin wench so god help me law my love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw yet i have a trick of the old rage bear with me i am sick i'll leave it by degrees soft let us see write lord have mercy on us on those three they are infected in their hearts it lies they have the plague and caught it of your eyes these lords are visited you are not free for the lord's tokens on

here was a consent knowing aforehand of our merriment to dash it like a christmas comedy some carry tale some please man some slight zany some mumble news some trencher knight some dick that smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick to make my lady laugh when she's disposed told our intents before which once disclosed the ladies did change favors and then we following the signs wooed but the sign of she now to our perjury to add more terror we are again forsworn in will and error much upon this 'tis and might not you forestall our sport to make us thus untrue do not you know my lady's foot by th' squier and laugh upon the apple of her eye and stand between her back sir and the fire holding a trencher jesting merrily you put our page out go you are allowed die when you will a smock

to have one show worse than the king's and his company a right description of our sport my lord why ask you there is five in the first show the pedant the braggart the hedge priest the fool and the

neglected time played foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies hath much deformed us fashioning our humors even to the opposèd end of our intents and what in us hath seemed ridiculous  as love is full of unbefitting strains all wanton as a child skipping and vain formed by the eye and therefore like the eye full of strange shapes of habits and of forms varying in subjects as the eye doth roll to every varied object in his glance which parti coated presence of loose love put on by us if in your heavenly eyes have misbecomed our oaths and gravities those heavenly eyes that look into these faults suggested us to make therefore ladies our love being yours the error that love makes is likewise yours we to ourselves prove false by being once false forever to be true to those that make us
