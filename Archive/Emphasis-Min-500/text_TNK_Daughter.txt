these strewings are for their chamber 'tis pity they are in prison and 'twere pity they should be out i do think they have patience to make any adversity ashamed the prison itself is proud of 'em and they have all the world in their chamber by my troth i think fame but stammers 'em they stand a grise above the reach of report nay most likely for they are noble suff'rers i marvel how they would have looked had they been victors that with such a constant nobility enforce a freedom out of bondage making misery their mirth and affliction a toy to jest at it seems to me they have no more sense of their captivity than i of ruling athens they eat well look merrily discourse of many things but nothing of their own restraint and disasters yet sometimes a divided sigh martyred as 'twere i' th' deliverance will break from one of them when the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that i could wish myself a sigh to be so chid or at least a sigher to be comforted no sir no that's palamon arcite is the lower of the twain you may perceive a part of him it is a holiday to look on them lord the diff'rence of men why should i love this gentleman 'tis odds he never will affect me i am base my father the mean keeper of his prison and he a prince to marry him is hopeless to be his whore is witless out upon 't what pushes are we wenches driven to when fifteen once has found us first i saw him i seeing thought he was a goodly man he has as much to please a woman in him if he please to bestow it so as ever these eyes yet looked on next i pitied him and so would any young wench o' my conscience that ever dreamed or vowed her maidenhead to a young handsome man then i loved him extremely loved him infinitely loved him and yet he had a cousin fair as he too but in my heart was palamon and there lord what a coil he keeps to hear him sing in an evening what a heaven it is and yet his songs are sad ones fairer spoken was never gentleman when i come in to bring him water in a morning first he bows his noble body then salutes me thus fair gentle maid good morrow may thy goodness get thee a happy husband once he kissed me i loved my lips the better ten days after would he would do so ev'ry day he grieves much  and me as much to see his misery what should i do to make him know i love him for i would fain enjoy him say i ventured to set him free what says the law then thus much for law or kindred i will do it and this night or tomorrow he shall love me let all the dukes and all the devils roar he is at liberty i have ventured for him and out i have brought him to a little wood a mile hence i have sent him where a cedar higher than all the rest spreads like a plane fast by a brook and there he shall keep close till i provide him files and food for yet his iron bracelets are not off o love what a stout hearted child thou art my father durst better have endured cold iron than done it i love him beyond love and beyond reason or wit or safety i have made him know it i care not i am desperate if the law find me and then condemn me for 't some wenches some honest hearted maids will sing my dirge and tell to memory my death was noble dying almost a martyr that way he takes i purpose is my way too sure he cannot be so unmanly as to leave me here if he do maids will not so easily trust men again and yet he has not thanked me for what i have done no not so much as kissed me and that methinks is not so well nor scarcely could i persuade him to become a free man he made such scruples of the wrong he did to me and to my father yet i hope when he considers more this love of mine will take more root within him let him do what he will with me so he use me kindly for use me so he shall or i'll proclaim him and to his face no man i'll presently provide him necessaries and pack my clothes up and where there is a path of ground i'll venture so he be with me by him like a shadow i'll ever dwell within this hour the hubbub will be all o'er the prison i am then kissing the man they look for farewell father get many more such prisoners and such daughters and shortly you may keep yourself now to him he has mistook the brake i meant is gone after his fancy 'tis now well nigh morning no matter would it were perpetual night and darkness lord o' th' world hark 'tis a wolf in me hath grief slain fear and but for one thing i care for nothing and that's palamon i reck not if the wolves would jaw me so he had this file what if i hallowed for him i cannot hallow if i whooped what then if he not answered i should call a wolf and do him but that service i have heard strange howls this livelong night why may 't not be they have made prey of him he has no weapons he cannot run the jingling of his gyves might call fell things to listen who have in them a sense to know a man unarmed and can smell where resistance is i'll set it down he's torn to pieces they howled many together and then they fed on him so much for that be bold to ring the bell how stand i then all's chared when he is gone no no i lie my father's to be hanged for his escape myself to beg if i prized life so much as to deny my act but that i would not should i try death by dozens i am moped food took i none these two days sipped some water i have not closed mine eyes save when my lids scoured off their brine alas dissolve my life let not my sense unsettle lest i should drown or stab or hang myself o state of nature fail together in me since thy best props are warped so which way now the best way is the next way to a grave each errant step beside is torment lo the moon is down the crickets chirp the screech owl calls in the dawn all offices are done save what i fail in but the point is this  an end and that is all i am very cold and all the stars are out too the little stars and all that look like aglets the sun has seen my folly palamon alas no he's in heaven where am i now yonder's the sea and there's a ship how 't tumbles and there's a rock lies watching under water now now it beats upon it now now now there's a leak sprung a sound one how they cry open her before the wind you'll lose all else up with a course or two and tack about boys good night good night you're gone i am very hungry would i could find a fine frog he would tell me news from all parts o' th' world then would i make a carrack of a cockleshell and sail by east and northeast to the king of pygmies for he tells fortunes rarely now my father twenty to one is trussed up in a trice tomorrow morning i'll say never a word for i'll cut my green coat a foot above my knee and i'll clip my yellow locks an inch below mine eye hey nonny nonny nonny he's buy me a white cut forth for to ride and i'll go seek him through the world that is so wide hey nonny nonny nonny o

for in the next world will dido see palamon and then will she be out of love with aeneas now for this charm that i told you of you must bring a piece of silver on the tip of your tongue or no ferry then if it be your chance to come where the blessed spirits are there's a sight now we maids that have our livers perished cracked to pieces with love we shall come there and do nothing all day long but pick flowers with proserpine then will i make palamon a nosegay then let him mark me then faith i'll tell you sometime we go to barley break we of the blessed alas 'tis a sore life they have i' th' other place such burning frying boiling hissing howling chatt'ring cursing o they have shrewd measure take heed if one be mad or hang or drown themselves thither they go jupiter bless us and there

with child they are in this place they shall stand in fire up to the navel and in ice up to th' heart and there th' offending part burns and the deceiving part freezes in troth a very grievous punishment as one would think for such a trifle believe me one would marry a leprous witch to be rid on 't i'll assure you to hear there a proud lady and a proud city wife howl together i were a beast
