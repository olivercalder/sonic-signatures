what work 's my countrymen in hand where go you with bats and clubs the matter speak i pray you why masters my good friends mine honest neighbors will you undo yourselves i tell you friends most charitable care have the patricians of you for your wants your suffering in this dearth you may as well strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them against the roman state whose course will on the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong link asunder than can ever appear in your impediment for the dearth the gods not the patricians make it and your knees to them not arms must help alack you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you and you slander the helms o' th' state who care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious or be accused of folly i shall tell you a pretty tale it may be you have heard it but since it serves my purpose i will venture to stale 't a little more there was a time when all the body's members rebelled against the belly thus accused it that only like a gulf it did remain i' th' midst o' th' body idle and unactive still cupboarding the viand never bearing like labor with the rest where th' other instruments did see and hear devise instruct walk feel and mutually participate did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body the belly answered  sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus  for look you i may make the belly smile as well as speak it tauntingly replied to th' discontented members the mutinous parts that envied his receipt even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you what then 'fore me this fellow speaks what then what then well what then i will tell you if you'll bestow a small of what you have little  patience awhile you'st hear the belly's answer note me this good friend your most grave belly was deliberate not rash like his accusers and thus answered true is it my incorporate friends quoth he that i receive the general food at first which you do live upon and fit it is because i am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body but if you do remember i send it through the rivers of your blood even to the court the heart to th' seat o' th' brain and through the cranks and offices of man the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live and though that all at once you my good friends this says the belly mark me  though all at once cannot see what i do deliver out to each yet i can make my audit up that all from me do back receive the flour of all and leave me but the bran what say you to 't the senators of rome are this good belly and you the mutinous members for examine their counsels and their cares digest things rightly touching the weal o' th' common you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves what do you think you the great toe of this assembly for that being one o' th' lowest basest poorest of this most wise rebellion thou goest foremost thou rascal that art worst in blood to run lead'st first to win some vantage but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs rome and her rats are at the point of battle the one side must have bale hail noble martius for corn at their own rates whereof they say the city is well stored nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you what says the other troop what is granted them this is strange o true bred the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight not according to the prayer of the people for they love not martius pray you who does the wolf love ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble martius he's a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you in what enormity is martius poor in that you two have not in abundance this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city i mean of us o' th' right hand file do you because you talk of pride now will you not be angry why 'tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so you blame martius for being proud i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves o that you could why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber in 't said to be something imperfect in favoring the first complaint hasty and tinder like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as you are i cannot call you lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it i cannot say your worships have delivered the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too what harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too you know neither me yourselves nor anything you are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a faucet seller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves you are a pair of strange ones our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honorable a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entombed in an ass's packsaddle yet you must be saying martius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary hangmen good e'en to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you how now my as fair as noble ladies and the moon were she earthly no nobler whither do you follow your eyes so fast ha martius coming home take my cap jupiter and i thank thee hoo martius coming home i will make my very house reel tonight a letter for me a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven years' health in which time i will make a lip at the physician the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horse drench is he not wounded he was wont to come home wounded so do i too if it be not too much brings he victory in his pocket the wounds become him has he disciplined aufidius soundly and 'twas time for him too i'll warrant him that an he had stayed by him i would not have been so 'fidiused for all the chests in corioles and the gold that's in them is the senate possessed of this wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his true purchasing true i'll be sworn they are true where is he wounded god save your good worships martius is coming home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded one i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh there's nine that i know now it's twenty seven every gash was an enemy's grave hark the trumpets welcome to rome renownèd coriolanus now the gods crown thee a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome a curse begin at very root on 's heart that is not glad to see thee you are three that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men we have some old crab trees here at home that will not be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our after meeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our well found successes to report a little of that worthy work performed by martius caius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honors like himself that's off that's off i would you rather had been silent please you to hear cominius speak he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow  worthy cominius speak nay keep your place pray now sit down masters of the people your multiplying spawn how can he flatter  that's thousand to one good one when you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honor than one on 's ears to hear it proceed cominius worthy man he's right noble let him be called for the senate coriolanus are well pleased to make thee consul it then remains that you do speak to the people put them not to 't pray you go fit you to the custom and take to you as your predecessors have your honor with your form do not stand upon 't  we recommend to you tribunes of the people our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honor o sir you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have done 't o me the gods you must not speak of that you must desire them to think upon you you'll mar all i'll leave you pray you speak to 'em i pray you in wholesome manner you have stood your limitation and the tribunes endue you with the people's voice remains that in th' official marks invested you anon do meet the senate i'll keep you company will you along the matter be calm be calm let's be calm not now not now well no more what what his choler well well no more of that come enough on both sides more respect peace peace peace stay hold peace what is about to be i am out of breath confusion's near i cannot speak you tribunes to th' people coriolanus patience  speak good sicinius fie fie fie this is the way to kindle not to quench and so are like to do hear me one word beseech you tribunes hear me but a word be that you seem truly your country's friend and temp'rately proceed to what you would thus violently redress down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile help martius help you that be noble help him young and old go get you to your house begone away all will be naught else shall it be put to that for 'tis a sore upon us you cannot tent yourself begone beseech you begone put not your worthy rage into your tongue one time will owe another i could myself take up a brace o' th' best of them yea the two tribunes pray you begone i'll try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little this must be patched with cloth of any color his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove for 's power to thunder his heart's his mouth what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry does forget that ever he heard the name of death here's goodly work i would they were in tiber what the vengeance could he not speak 'em fair you worthy tribunes  sir sir  do not cry havoc where you should but hunt with modest warrant hear me speak as i do know the consul's worthiness so can i name his faults the consul coriolanus if by the tribunes' leave and yours good people i may be heard i would crave a word or two the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time now the good gods forbid that our renownèd rome whose gratitude towards her deservèd children is enrolled in jove's own book like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own o he's a limb that has but a disease  mortal to cut it off to cure it easy what has he done to rome that's worthy death killing our enemies the blood he hath lost  which i dare vouch is more than that he hath by many an ounce he dropped it for his country and what is left to lose it by his country were to us all that do 't and suffer it a brand to th' end o' th' world one word more one word this tiger footed rage when it shall find the harm of unscanned swiftness will too late tie leaden pounds to 's heels proceed by process lest parties as he is beloved break out and sack great rome with romans consider this he has been bred i' th' wars since he could draw a sword and is ill schooled in bolted language meal and bran together he throws without distinction give me leave i'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril i'll bring him to you let me desire your company he must come or what is worst will follow come come you have been too rough something too rough you must return and mend it well said noble woman before he should thus stoop to th' herd but that the violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic for the whole state i would put mine armor on which i can scarcely bear return to th' tribunes repent what you have spoke a good demand noble lady  come go with us speak fair you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the loss of what is past this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being asked as free as words to little purpose only fair speech ay but mildly calmly i do beseech you a noble wish lo citizens he says he is content the warlike service he has done consider think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves i' th' holy churchyard consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you nay temperately your promise is this the promise that you made your mother that's worthily as any ear can hear come let's not weep if i could shake off but one seven years from these old arms and legs by the good gods i'd with thee every foot peace peace be not so loud come come peace you have told them home and by my troth you have cause you'll sup with me fie fie fie hail to you both all's well and might have been much better if he could have temporized nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife hear nothing from him i think not so 'tis aufidius who hearing of our martius' banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world which were inshelled when martius stood for rome and durst not once peep out cannot be we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like hath been within my age but reason with the fellow before you punish him where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atone than violent'st contrariety what news what news what's the news what's the news pray now your news  you have made fair work i fear me pray your news if martius should be joined with volscians  you have made good work you and your apron men you that stood so much upon the voice of occupation and the breath of garlic eaters as hercules did shake down mellow fruit you have made fair work we are all undone unless the noble man have mercy 'tis true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it i have not the face to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands you and your crafts you have crafted fair how was 't we we loved him but like beasts and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o' th' city here come the clusters  and is aufidius with him you are they that made the air unwholesome when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus' exile now he's coming and not a hair upon a soldier's head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down and pay you for your voices 'tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal we have deserved it you have made good work you and your cry  shall 's to the capitol no i'll not go you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general who loved him in a most dear particular he called me father but what o' that go you that banished him a mile before his tent fall down and knee the way into his mercy nay if he coyed to hear cominius speak i'll keep at home do you hear why so you have made good work a pair of tribunes that have wracked rome to make coals cheap a noble memory very well could he say less for one poor grain or two i am one of those his mother wife his child and this brave fellow too we are the grains you are the musty chaff and you are smelt above the moon we must be burnt for you no i'll not meddle what should i do well and say that martius return me as cominius is returned unheard what then but as a discontented friend grief shot with his unkindness say 't be so i'll undertake 't i think he'll hear me yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me he was not taken well he had not dined the veins unfilled our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuffed these pipes and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priestlike fasts therefore i'll watch him till he be dieted to my request and then i'll set upon him good faith i'll prove him speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge of my success you guard like men 'tis well but by your leave i am an officer of state and come to speak with coriolanus from rome good my friends if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name hath touched your ears it is menenius i tell thee fellow thy general is my lover i have been the book of his good acts whence men have read his fame unparalleled happily amplified for i have ever verified my friends  of whom he's chief with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes like to a bowl upon a subtle ground i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise have almost stamped the leasing therefore fellow i must have leave to pass prithee fellow remember my name is menenius always factionary on the party of your general has he dined can'st thou tell for i would not speak with him till after dinner i am as thy general is sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me with estimation i mean thy general nay but fellow fellow  now you companion i'll say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from my son coriolanus guess but by my entertainment with him if thou stand'st not i' th' state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueler in suffering behold now presently and swoon for what's to come upon thee the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does o my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee here's water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this who like a block hath denied my access to thee how away i neither care for th' world nor your general for such things as you i can scarce think there's any you're so slight he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst for you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age i say to you as i was said to away see you yond coign o' th' capitol yond cornerstone if it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of rome especially his mother may prevail with him but i say there is no hope in 't our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution there is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub this martius is grown from man to dragon he has wings he's more than a creeping thing so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight year old horse the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery he sits in his state as a thing made for alexander what he bids be done is finished with his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in i paint him in the character mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find and all this is long of you no in such a case the gods will not be good unto us when we banished him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us this is good news i will go meet the ladies this volumnia is worth of consuls senators patricians a city full of tribunes such as you a sea and land full you have prayed well today this morning for ten thousand of your throats i'd not have given a doit hark how they joy
