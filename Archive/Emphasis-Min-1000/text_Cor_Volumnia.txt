i pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort if my son were my husband i should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love when yet he was but tender bodied and the only son of my womb when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding i considering how honor would become such a person that it was no better than picture like to hang by th' wall if renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame to a cruel war i sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak i tell thee daughter i sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man then his good report should have been my son i therein would have found issue hear me profess sincerely had i a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good martius i had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action indeed you shall not methinks i hear hither your husband's drum see him pluck aufidius down by th' hair as children from a bear the volsces shunning him methinks i see him stamp thus and call thus come on you cowards you were got in fear though you were born in rome his bloody brow with his mailed hand then wiping forth he goes like to a harvestman that's tasked to mow or all or lose his hire away you fool it more becomes a man than gilt his trophy the breasts of hecuba when she did suckle hector looked not lovelier than hector's forehead when it spit forth blood at grecian sword contemning tell valeria we are fit to bid her welcome he'll beat aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck sweet madam he had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster one on 's father's moods she shall she shall why i pray you let her alone lady as she is now she will but disease our better mirth honorable menenius my boy martius approaches for the love of juno let's go ay worthy menenius and with most prosperous approbation look here's a letter from him the state hath another his wife another and i think there's one at home for you o he is wounded i thank the gods for 't on 's brows menenius he comes the third time home with the oaken garland titus lartius writes they fought together but aufidius got off good ladies let's go yes yes yes the senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly true pow waw i' th' shoulder and i' th' left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i' th' body he had before this last expedition twenty five wounds upon him these are the ushers of martius before him he carries noise and behind him he leaves tears death that dark spirit in 's nervy arm doth lie which being advanced declines and then men die welcome to rome renownèd coriolanus nay my good soldier up my gentle martius worthy caius and by deed achieving honor newly named  what is it coriolanus must i call thee but o thy wife  i know not where to turn o welcome home  and welcome general and you're welcome all i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy only there's one thing wanting which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee o sir sir sir i would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out you might have been enough the man you are with striving less to be so lesser had been the thwartings of your dispositions if you had not showed them how you were disposed ere they lacked power to cross you ay and burn too pray be counseled i have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble but when extremities speak i have heard you say honor and policy like unsevered friends i' th' war do grow together grant that and tell me in peace what each of them by th' other lose that they combine not there if it be honor in your wars to seem the same you are not which for your best ends you adopt your policy how is it less or worse that it shall hold companionship in peace with honor as in war since that to both it stands in like request because that now it lies you on to speak to th' people not by your own instruction nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but roted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth now this no more dishonors you at all than to take in a town with gentle words which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required i should do so in honor i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin i prithee now my son go to them with this bonnet in thy hand and thus far having stretched it here be with them  thy knee bussing the stones for in such business action is eloquence and the eyes of th' ignorant more learnèd than the ears waving thy head which often thus correcting thy stout heart now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling or say to them thou art their soldier and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which thou dost confess were fit for thee to use as they to claim in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far as thou hast power and person prithee now go and be ruled although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower here is cominius he must and will  prithee now say you will and go about it i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said my praises made thee first a soldier so to have my praise for this perform a part thou hast not done before at thy choice then to beg of thee it is my more dishonor than thou of them come all to ruin let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death with as big heart as thou do as thou list thy valiantness was mine thou suck'st it from me but owe thy pride thyself do your will now the red pestilence strike all trades in rome and occupations perish my first son whither wilt thou go take good cominius with thee awhile determine on some course more than a wild exposure to each chance that starts i' th' way before thee o you're well met the hoarded plague o' th' gods requite your love if that i could for weeping you should hear  nay and you shall hear some will you be gone ay fool is that a shame note but this fool was not a man my father hadst thou foxship to banish him that struck more blows for rome than thou hast spoken words more noble blows than ever thou wise words and for rome's good i'll tell thee what yet go nay but thou shalt stay too i would my son were in arabia and thy tribe before him his good sword in his hand bastards and all good man the wounds that he does bear for rome i would he had 'twas you incensed the rabble cats that can judge as fitly of his worth as i can of those mysteries which heaven will not have earth to know now pray sir get you gone you have done a brave deed ere you go hear this as far as doth the capitol exceed the meanest house in rome so far my son  this lady's husband here this do you see  whom you have banished does exceed you all take my prayers with you i would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses could i meet 'em but once a day it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to 't anger's my meat i sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding come let's go leave this faint puling and lament as i do in anger juno like come come come o stand up blest whilst with no softer cushion than the flint i kneel before thee and unproperly show duty as mistaken all this while between the child and parent thou art my warrior i holp to frame thee do you know this lady this is a poor epitome of yours which by th' interpretation of full time may show like all yourself your knee sirrah even he your wife this lady and myself are suitors to you o no more no more you have said you will not grant us anything for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already yet we will ask that if you fail in our request the blame may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us should we be silent and not speak our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that thy sight which should make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother wife and child to see the son the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out and to poor we thine enmity's most capital thou barr'st us our prayers to the gods which is a comfort that all but we enjoy for how can we  alas how can we for our country pray whereto we are bound together with thy victory whereto we are bound alack or we must lose the country our dear nurse or else thy person our comfort in the country we must find an evident calamity though we had our wish which side should win for either thou must as a foreign recreant be led with manacles through our streets or else triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood for myself son i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine if i cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread  trust to 't thou shalt not on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world nay go not from us thus if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans thereby to destroy the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us as poisonous of your honor no our suit is that you reconcile them while the volsces may say this mercy we have showed the romans this we received and each in either side give the all hail to thee and cry be blest for making up this peace thou know'st great son the end of war's uncertain but this certain that if thou conquer rome the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name whose repetition will be dogged with curses whose chronicle thus writ the man was noble but with his last attempt he wiped it out destroyed his country and his name remains to th' ensuing age abhorred speak to me son thou hast affected the fine strains of honor to imitate the graces of the gods to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' th' air and yet to charge thy sulfur with a bolt that should but rive an oak why dost not speak think'st thou it honorable for a noble man still to remember wrongs daughter speak you he cares not for your weeping speak thou boy perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons there's no man in the world more bound to 's mother yet here he lets me prate like one i' th' stocks thou hast never in thy life showed thy dear mother any courtesy when she poor hen fond of no second brood has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaden with honor say my request's unjust and spurn me back but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee that thou restrain'st from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs he turns away  down ladies let us shame him with our knees to his surname coriolanus 'longs more pride than pity to our prayers down an end this is the last so we will home to rome and die among our neighbors nay behold 's this boy that cannot tell what he would have but kneels and holds up hands for fellowship does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny 't come let us go this fellow had a volscian to his mother his wife is in corioles and his child like him by chance yet give us our dispatch i am hushed until our city be afire and then i'll speak a little
