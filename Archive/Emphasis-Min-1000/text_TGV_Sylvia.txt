my will is even this that presently you hie you home to bed thou subtle perjured false disloyal man think'st thou i am so shallow so conceitless to be seducèd by thy flattery that hast deceived so many with thy vows return return and make thy love amends for me by this pale queen of night i swear i am so far from granting thy request that i despise thee for thy wrongful suit and by and by intend to chide myself even for this time i spend in talking to thee say that she be yet valentine thy friend survives to whom thyself art witness i am betrothed and art thou not ashamed to wrong him with thy importunacy and so suppose am i for in his grave assure thyself my love is burièd go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence or at the least in hers sepulcher thine i am very loath to be your idol sir but since your falsehood shall become you well to worship shadows and adore false shapes send to me in the morning and i'll send it and so good rest who calls sir eglamour a thousand times good morrow o eglamour thou art a gentleman  think not i flatter for i swear i do not  valiant wise remorseful well accomplished thou art not ignorant what dear good will i bear unto the banished valentine nor how my father would enforce me marry vain thurio whom my very soul abhorred thyself hast loved and i have heard thee say no grief did ever come so near thy heart as when thy lady and thy true love died upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity sir eglamour i would to valentine to mantua where i hear he makes abode and for the ways are dangerous to pass i do desire thy worthy company upon whose faith and honor i repose urge not my father's anger eglamour but think upon my grief a lady's grief and on the justice of my flying hence to keep me from a most unholy match which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues i do desire thee even from a heart as full of sorrows as the sea of sands to bear me company and go with me if not to hide what i have said to thee that i may venture to depart alone this evening coming at friar patrick's cell where i intend holy confession good morrow kind sir eglamour what would you with her if that i be she from whom o he sends you for a picture ursula bring my picture there go give your master this tell him from me one julia that his changing thoughts forget would better fit his chamber than this shadow i pray thee let me look on that again there hold i will not look upon your master's lines i know they are stuffed with protestations and full of new found oaths which he will break as easily as i do tear his paper the more shame for him that he sends it me for i have heard him say a thousand times his julia gave it him at his departure though his false finger have profaned the ring mine shall not do his julia so much wrong what sayst thou dost thou know her belike she thinks that proteus hath forsook her is she not passing fair how tall was she she is beholding to thee gentle youth alas poor lady desolate and left i weep myself to think upon thy words here youth there is my purse i give thee this for thy sweet mistress' sake because thou lov'st her farewell amen amen go on good eglamour out at the postern by the abbey wall i fear i am attended by some spies a thousand more mischances than this one have learned me how to brook this patiently o valentine this i endure for thee o miserable unhappy that i am by thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy had i been seizèd by a hungry lion i would have been a breakfast to the beast rather than have false proteus rescue me o heaven be judge how i love valentine whose life's as tender to me as my soul and full as much for more there cannot be i do detest false perjured proteus therefore begone solicit me no more when proteus cannot love where he's beloved read over julia's heart thy first best love for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith into a thousand oaths and all those oaths descended into perjury to love me thou hast no faith left now unless thou 'dst two and that's far worse than none better have none than plural faith which is too much by one thou counterfeit to thy true friend all men but proteus o heaven
