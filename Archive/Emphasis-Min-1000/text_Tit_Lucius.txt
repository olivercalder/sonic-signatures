give us the proudest prisoner of the goths that we may hew his limbs and on a pile ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh before this earthy prison of their bones that so the shadows be not unappeased nor we disturbed with prodigies on earth away with him and make a fire straight and with our swords upon a pile of wood let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed see lord and father how we have performed our roman rites alarbus' limbs are lopped and entrails feed the sacrificing fire whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky remaineth naught but to inter our brethren and with loud larums welcome them to rome proud saturnine interrupter of the good that noble minded titus means to thee and that he will and shall if lucius live my lord you are unjust and more than so in wrongful quarrel you have slain your son dead if you will but not to be his wife that is another's lawful promised love but let us give him burial as becomes give mutius burial with our brethren dear father soul and substance of us all  there lie thy bones sweet mutius with thy friends' till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb no man shed tears for noble mutius he lives in fame that died in virtue's cause we do and vow to heaven and to his highness that what we did was mildly as we might tend'ring our sister's honor and our own o noble father you lament in vain the tribunes hear you not no man is by and you recount your sorrows to a stone my gracious lord no tribune hears you speak to rescue my two brothers from their death for which attempt the judges have pronounced my everlasting doom of banishment ay me this object kills me speak gentle sister who hath martyred thee o say thou for her who hath done this deed sweet father cease your tears for at your grief see how my wretched sister sobs and weeps ah my lavinia i will wipe thy cheeks stay father for that noble hand of thine that hath thrown down so many enemies shall not be sent my hand will serve the turn my youth can better spare my blood than you and therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives by heaven it shall not go sweet father if i shall be thought thy son let me redeem my brothers both from death then i'll go fetch an ax ah that this sight should make so deep a wound and yet detested life not shrink thereat that ever death should let life bear his name where life hath no more interest but to breathe farewell andronicus my noble father the woefull'st man that ever lived in rome farewell proud rome till lucius come again he loves his pledges dearer than his life farewell lavinia my noble sister o would thou wert as thou tofore hast been but now nor lucius nor lavinia lives but in oblivion and hateful griefs if lucius live he will requite your wrongs and make proud saturnine and his empress beg at the gates like tarquin and his queen now will i to the goths and raise a power to be revenged on rome and saturnine approvèd warriors and my faithful friends i have receivèd letters from great rome which signifies what hate they bear their emperor and how desirous of our sight they are therefore great lords be as your titles witness imperious and impatient of your wrongs and wherein rome hath done you any scathe let him make treble satisfaction i humbly thank him and i thank you all but who comes here led by a lusty goth o worthy goth this is the incarnate devil that robbed andronicus of his good hand this is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye and here's the base fruit of her burning lust  say wall eyed slave whither wouldst thou convey this growing image of thy fiendlike face why dost not speak what deaf not a word  a halter soldiers hang him on this tree and by his side his fruit of bastardy too like the sire for ever being good first hang the child that he may see it sprawl a sight to vex the father's soul withal get me a ladder say on and if it please me which thou speak'st thy child shall live and i will see it nourished tell on thy mind i say thy child shall live who should i swear by thou believest no god that granted how canst thou believe an oath even by my god i swear to thee i will o most insatiate and luxurious woman o detestable villain call'st thou that trimming o barbarous beastly villains like thyself art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds bring down the devil for he must not die so sweet a death as hanging presently sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more let him come near welcome aemilius what's the news from rome aemilius let the emperor give his pledges unto my father and my uncle marcus and we will come march away uncle marcus since 'tis my father's mind that i repair to rome i am content good uncle take you in this barbarous moor this ravenous tiger this accursèd devil let him receive no sust'nance fetter him till he be brought unto the empress' face for testimony of her foul proceedings and see the ambush of our friends be strong i fear the emperor means no good to us away inhuman dog unhallowed slave  sirs help our uncle to convey him in the trumpets show the emperor is at hand what boots it thee to call thyself a sun can the son's eye behold his father bleed there's meed for meed death for a deadly deed then gracious auditory be it known to you that chiron and the damned demetrius were they that murderèd our emperor's brother and they it were that ravishèd our sister for their fell faults our brothers were beheaded our father's tears despised and basely cozened of that true hand that fought rome's quarrel out and sent her enemies unto the grave lastly myself unkindly banishèd the gates shut on me and turned weeping out to beg relief among rome's enemies who drowned their enmity in my true tears and oped their arms to embrace me as a friend i am the turned forth be it known to you that have preserved her welfare in my blood and from her bosom took the enemy's point sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body alas you know i am no vaunter i my scars can witness dumb although they are that my report is just and full of truth but soft methinks i do digress too much citing my worthless praise o pardon me for when no friends are by men praise themselves thanks gentle romans may i govern so to heal rome's harms and wipe away her woe but gentle people give me aim awhile for nature puts me to a heavy task stand all aloof but uncle draw you near to shed obsequious tears upon this trunk o take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips these sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstained face the last true duties of thy noble son come hither boy come come and learn of us to melt in showers thy grandsire loved thee well many a time he danced thee on his knee sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow many a story hath he told to thee and bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind and talk of them when he was dead and gone set him breast deep in earth and famish him there let him stand and rave and cry for food if anyone relieves or pities him for the offense he dies this is our doom some stay to see him fastened in the earth some loving friends convey the emperor hence and give him burial in his fathers' grave my father and lavinia shall forthwith be closèd in our household's monument as for that ravenous tiger tamora no funeral rite nor man in mourning weed no mournful bell shall ring her burial but throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey her life was beastly and devoid of pity and being dead let birds on her take pity
