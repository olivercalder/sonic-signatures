your father for the contract you pretend with that base wretch  one bred of alms and fostered with cold dishes with scraps o' th' court it is no contract none and though it be allowed in meaner parties  yet who than he more mean to knit their souls on whom there is no more dependency but brats and beggary in self figured knot yet you are curbed from that enlargement by the consequence o' th' crown and must not foil the precious note of it with a base slave a hilding for a livery a squire's cloth a pantler not so eminent the south fog rot him his garment now the devil  his garment you have abused me his meanest garment i will inform your father i'll be revenged his mean'st garment well there be many caesars ere such another julius britain's a world by itself and we will nothing pay for wearing our own noses come there's no more tribute to be paid our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and as i said there is no more such caesars other of them may have crooked noses but to owe such straight arms none we have yet many among us can grip as hard as cassibelan i do not say i am one but i have a hand why tribute why should we pay tribute if caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light else sir no more tribute pray you now his majesty bids you welcome make pastime with us a day or two or longer if you seek us afterwards in other terms you shall find us in our saltwater girdle if you beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in the adventure our crows shall fare the better for you and there's an end receive it friendly but from this time forth i wear it as your enemy 'tis all the better your valiant britons have their wishes in it that man of hers pisanio her old servant i have not seen these two days 'tis certain she is fled go in and cheer the king he rages none dare come about him i love and hate her for she's fair and royal and that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite than lady ladies woman from every one the best she hath and she of all compounded outsells them all i love her therefore but disdaining me and throwing favors on the low posthumus slanders so her judgment that what's else rare is choked and in that point i will conclude to hate her nay indeed to be revenged upon her for when fools shall who is here what are you packing sirrah come hither ah you precious pander villain where is thy lady in a word or else thou art straightway with the fiends where is thy lady or by jupiter  i will not ask again close villain i'll have this secret from thy heart or rip thy heart to find it is she with posthumus from whose so many weights of baseness cannot a dram of worth be drawn where is she sir come nearer no farther halting satisfy me home what is become of her all worthy villain discover where thy mistress is at once at the next word no more of worthy lord speak or thy silence on the instant is thy condemnation and thy death let's see 't i will pursue her even to augustus' throne humh sirrah is this letter true it is posthumus' hand i know 't sirrah if thou wouldst not be a villain but do me true service undergo those employments wherein i should have cause to use thee with a serious industry  that is what villainy soe'er i bid thee do to perform it directly and truly i would think thee an honest man thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment wilt thou serve me for since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar posthumus thou canst not in the course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of mine wilt thou serve me give me thy hand here's my purse hast any of thy late master's garments in thy possession the first service thou dost me fetch that suit hither let it be thy first service go meet thee at milford haven i forgot to ask him one thing i'll remember 't anon even there thou villain posthumus will i kill thee i would these garments were come she said upon a time  the bitterness of it i now belch from my heart  that she held the very garment of posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person together with the adornment of my qualities with that suit upon my back will i ravish her first kill him and in her eyes there shall she see my valor which will then be a torment to her contempt he on the ground my speech of insultment ended on his dead body and when my lust hath dined which as i say to vex her i will execute in the clothes that she so praised to the court i'll knock her back foot her home again she hath despised me rejoicingly and i'll be merry in my revenge be those the garments how long is 't since she went to milford haven bring this apparel to my chamber that is the second thing that i have commanded thee the third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design be but duteous and true preferment shall tender itself to thee my revenge is now at milford would i had wings to follow it come and be true i am near to th' place where they should meet if pisanio have mapped it truly how fit his garments serve me why should his mistress who was made by him that made the tailor not be fit too the rather saving reverence of the word for 'tis said a woman's fitness comes by fits therein i must play the workman i dare speak it to myself for it is not vainglory for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber i mean the lines of my body are as well drawn as his no less young more strong not beneath him in fortunes beyond him in the advantage of the time above him in birth alike conversant in general services and more remarkable in single oppositions yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite what mortality is posthumus thy head which now is growing upon thy shoulders shall within this hour be off thy mistress enforced thy garments cut to pieces before thy face and all this done spurn her home to her father who may haply be a little angry or my so rough usage but my mother having power of his testiness shall turn all into my commendations my horse is tied up safe out sword and to a sore purpose fortune put them into my hand this is the very description of their meeting place and the fellow dares not deceive me i cannot find those runagates that villain hath mocked me i am faint soft what are you that fly me thus some villain mountaineers i have heard of such what slave art thou thou art a robber a lawbreaker a villain yield thee thief thou villain base know'st me not by my clothes thou precious varlet my tailor made them not thou injurious thief hear but my name and tremble cloten thou villain to thy further fear nay to thy mere confusion thou shalt know i am son to th' queen art not afeard die the death when i have slain thee with my proper hand i'll follow those that even now fled hence and on the gates of lud's town set your heads yield rustic mountaineer
