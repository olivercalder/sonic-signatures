hist romeo hist o for a falc'ner's voice to lure this tassel gentle back again bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud else would i tear the cave where echo lies and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine with repetition of my romeo romeo what o'clock tomorrow shall i send to thee i will not fail 'tis twenty year till then i have forgot why i did call thee back i shall forget to have thee still stand there rememb'ring how i love thy company 'tis almost morning i would have thee gone and yet no farther than a wanton's bird that lets it hop a little from his hand like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves and with a silken thread plucks it back again so loving jealous of his liberty sweet so would i yet i should kill thee with much cherishing good night good night parting is such sweet sorrow that i shall say good night till it be morrow the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse in half an hour she promised to return perchance she cannot meet him that's not so o she is lame love's heralds should be thoughts which ten times faster glides than the sun's beams driving back shadows over louring hills therefore do nimble pinioned doves draw love and therefore hath the wind swift cupid wings now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day's journey and from nine till twelve is three long hours yet she is not come had she affections and warm youthful blood she would be as swift in motion as a ball my words would bandy her to my sweet love and his to me but old folks many feign as they were dead unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead o god she comes o honey nurse what news hast thou met with him send thy man away now good sweet nurse o lord why lookest thou sad though news be sad yet tell them merrily if good thou shamest the music of sweet news by playing it to me with so sour a face i would thou hadst my bones and i thy news nay come i pray thee speak good good nurse speak how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath the excuse that thou dost make in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse is thy news good or bad answer to that say either and i'll stay the circumstance let me be satisfied is 't good or bad no no but all this did i know before what says he of our marriage what of that i' faith i am sorry that thou art not well sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love where is my mother why she is within where should she be how oddly thou repliest your love says like an honest gentleman where is your mother here's such a coil come what says romeo i have hie to high fortune honest nurse farewell good even to my ghostly confessor as much to him else is his thanks too much conceit more rich in matter than in words brags of his substance not of ornament they are but beggars that can count their worth but my true love is grown to such excess i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth gallop apace you fiery footed steeds towards phoebus' lodging such a wagoner as phaëton would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately spread thy close curtain love performing night that runaways' eyes may wink and romeo leap to these arms untalked of and unseen lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties or if love be blind it best agrees with night come civil night thou sober suited matron all in black and learn me how to lose a winning match played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks with thy black mantle till strange love grow bold think true love acted simple modesty come night come romeo come thou day in night for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow upon a raven's back come gentle night come loving black browed night give me my romeo and when i shall die take him and cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun o i have bought the mansion of a love but not possessed it and though i am sold not yet enjoyed so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them o here comes my nurse and she brings news and every tongue that speaks but romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence  now nurse what news what hast thou there the cords that romeo bid thee fetch ay me what news why dost thou wring thy hands can heaven be so envious what devil art thou that dost torment me thus this torture should be roared in dismal hell hath romeo slain himself say thou but ay and that bare vowel i shall poison more than the death darting eye of cockatrice i am not i if there be such an i or those eyes shut that makes thee answer ay if he be slain say ay or if not no brief sounds determine my weal or woe o break my heart poor bankrout break at once to prison eyes ne'er look on liberty vile earth to earth resign end motion here and thou and romeo press one heavy bier what storm is this that blows so contrary is romeo slaughtered and is tybalt dead my dearest cousin and my dearer lord then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom for who is living if those two are gone o god did romeo's hand shed tybalt's blood o serpent heart hid with a flow'ring face did ever dragon keep so fair a cave beautiful tyrant fiend angelical dove feathered raven wolvish ravening lamb despisèd substance of divinest show just opposite to what thou justly seem'st a damnèd saint an honorable villain o nature what hadst thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound o that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace blistered be thy tongue for such a wish he was not born to shame upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit for 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned sole monarch of the universal earth o what a beast was i to chide at him shall i speak ill of him that is my husband ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name when i thy three hours wife have mangled it but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin that villain cousin would have killed my husband back foolish tears back to your native spring your tributary drops belong to woe which you mistaking offer up to joy my husband lives that tybalt would have slain and tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband all this is comfort wherefore weep i then some word there was worser than tybalt's death that murdered me i would forget it fain but o it presses to my memory like damnèd guilty deeds to sinners' minds tybalt is dead and romeo banishèd that banishèd that one word banishèd hath slain ten thousand tybalts tybalt's death was woe enough if it had ended there or if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be ranked with other griefs why followed not when she said tybalt's dead thy father or thy mother nay or both which modern lamentation might have moved but with a rearward following tybalt's death romeo is banishèd to speak that word is father mother tybalt romeo juliet all slain all dead romeo is banishèd there is no end no limit measure bound in that word's death no words can that woe sound where is my father and my mother nurse wash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spent when theirs are dry for romeo's banishment  take up those cords poor ropes you are beguiled both you and i for romeo is exiled he made you for a highway to my bed but i a maid die maiden widowèd come cords come nurse i'll to my wedding bed and death not romeo take my maidenhead o find him give this ring to my true knight and bid him come to take his last farewell wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree believe me love it was the nightingale yond light is not daylight i know it i it is some meteor that the sun exhaled to be to thee this night a torchbearer and light thee on thy way to mantua therefore stay yet thou need'st not to be gone it is it is hie hence begone away it is the lark that sings so out of tune straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps some say the lark makes sweet division this doth not so for she divideth us some say the lark and loathèd toad changed eyes o now i would they had changed voices too since arm from arm that voice doth us affray hunting thee hence with hunt's up to the day o now begone more light and light it grows nurse then window let day in and let life out art thou gone so love lord ay husband friend i must hear from thee every day in the hour for in a minute there are many days o by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo o think'st thou we shall ever meet again o god i have an ill divining soul methinks i see thee now thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale o fortune fortune all men call thee fickle if thou art fickle what dost thou with him that is renowned for faith be fickle fortune for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long but send him back who is 't that calls it is my lady mother is she not down so late or up so early what unaccustomed cause procures her hither madam i am not well yet let me weep for such a feeling loss feeling so the loss i cannot choose but ever weep the friend what villain madam villain and he be many miles asunder  god pardon him i do with all my heart and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart ay madam from the reach of these my hands would none but i might venge my cousin's death indeed i never shall be satisfied with romeo till i behold him dead  is my poor heart so for a kinsman vexed madam if you could find out but a man to bear a poison i would temper it that romeo should upon receipt thereof soon sleep in quiet o how my heart abhors to hear him named and cannot come to him to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that hath slaughtered him and joy comes well in such a needy time what are they beseech your ladyship madam in happy time what day is that now by saint peter's church and peter too he shall not make me there a joyful bride i wonder at this haste that i must wed ere he that should be husband comes to woo i pray you tell my lord and father madam i will not marry yet and when i do i swear it shall be romeo whom you know i hate rather than paris these are news indeed not proud you have but thankful that you have proud can i never be of what i hate but thankful even for hate that is meant love good father i beseech you on my knees hear me with patience but to speak a word is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief  o sweet my mother cast me not away delay this marriage for a month a week or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies o god o nurse how shall this be prevented my husband is on earth my faith in heaven how shall that faith return again to earth unless that husband send it me from heaven by leaving earth comfort me counsel me  alack alack that heaven should practice stratagems upon so soft a subject as myself  what sayst thou hast thou not a word of joy some comfort nurse speak'st thou from thy heart amen well thou hast comforted me marvelous much go in and tell my lady i am gone having displeased my father to lawrence' cell to make confession and to be absolved ancient damnation o most wicked fiend is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue which she hath praised him with above compare so many thousand times go counselor thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain i'll to the friar to know his remedy if all else fail myself have power to die that may be sir when i may be a wife what must be shall be to answer that i should confess to you i will confess to you that i love him if i do so it will be of more price being spoke behind your back than to your face the tears have got small victory by that for it was bad enough before their spite that is no slander sir which is a truth and what i spake i spake it to my face it may be so for it is not mine own  are you at leisure holy father now or shall i come to you at evening mass o shut the door and when thou hast done so come weep with me past hope past care past help tell me not friar that thou hearest of this unless thou tell me how i may prevent it if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise and with this knife i'll help it presently god joined my heart and romeo's thou our hands and ere this hand by thee to romeo's sealed shall be the label to another deed or my true heart with treacherous revolt turn to another this shall slay them both therefore out of thy long experienced time give me some present counsel or behold 'twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the umpire arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honor bring be not so long to speak i long to die if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy o bid me leap rather than marry paris from off the battlements of any tower or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk where serpents are chain me with roaring bears or hide me nightly in a charnel house o'ercovered quite with dead men's rattling bones with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls or bid me go into a new made grave and hide me with a dead man in his shroud things that to hear them told have made me tremble and i will do it without fear or doubt to live an unstained wife to my sweet love give me give me o tell not me of fear love give me strength and strength shall help afford farewell dear father where i have learned me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you and your behests and am enjoined by holy lawrence to fall prostrate here to beg your pardon pardon i beseech you henceforward i am ever ruled by you i met the youthful lord at lawrence' cell and gave him what becomèd love i might not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty nurse will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ay those attires are best but gentle nurse i pray thee leave me to myself tonight for i have need of many orisons to move the heavens to smile upon my state which well thou knowest is cross and full of sin no madam we have culled such necessaries as are behooveful for our state tomorrow so please you let me now be left alone and let the nurse this night sit up with you for i am sure you have your hands full all in this so sudden business farewell god knows when we shall meet again i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins that almost freezes up the heat of life i'll call them back again to comfort me  nurse what should she do here my dismal scene i needs must act alone come vial what if this mixture do not work at all shall i be married then tomorrow morning no no this shall forbid it lie thou there what if it be a poison which the friar subtly hath ministered to have me dead lest in this marriage he should be dishonored because he married me before to romeo i fear it is and yet methinks it should not for he hath still been tried a holy man how if when i am laid into the tomb i wake before the time that romeo come to redeem me there's a fearful point shall i not then be stifled in the vault to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in and there die strangled ere my romeo comes or if i live is it not very like the horrible conceit of death and night together with the terror of the place  as in a vault an ancient receptacle where for this many hundred years the bones of all my buried ancestors are packed where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth lies fest'ring in his shroud where as they say at some hours in the night spirits resort  alack alack is it not like that i so early waking what with loathsome smells and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth that living mortals hearing them run mad  o if i wake shall i not be distraught environèd with all these hideous fears and madly play with my forefathers' joints and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud and in this rage with some great kinsman's bone as with a club dash out my desp'rate brains o look methinks i see my cousin's ghost seeking out romeo that did spit his body upon a rapier's point stay tybalt stay romeo romeo romeo here's drink i drink to thee o comfortable friar where is my lord i do remember well where i should be and there i am where is my romeo go get thee hence for i will not away what's here a cup closed in my true love's hand poison i see hath been his timeless end  o churl drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after i will kiss thy lips haply some poison yet doth hang on them to make me die with a restorative thy lips are warm yea noise then i'll be brief o happy dagger this is thy sheath there rust and let me die
