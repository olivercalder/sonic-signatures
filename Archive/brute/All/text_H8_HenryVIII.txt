earthly queens she's noble born and like her true nobility she has carried herself towards me my lord cardinal i do excuse you yea upon mine honor i free you from 't you are not to be taught that you have many enemies that know not why they are so but like to village curs bark when their fellows do by some of these the queen is put in anger you're excused but will you be more justified you ever have wished the sleeping of this business never desired it to be stirred but oft have hindered oft the passages made toward it on my honor i speak my good lord cardinal to this point and thus far clear him now what moved me to 't i will be bold with time and your attention then mark th' inducement thus it came give heed to 't my conscience first received a tenderness scruple and prick on certain speeches uttered by th' bishop of bayonne then french ambassador who had been hither sent on the debating a marriage 'twixt the duke of orleans and our daughter mary i' th' progress of this business ere a determinate resolution he i mean the bishop did require a respite wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate respecting this our marriage with the dowager sometime our brother's wife this respite shook the bosom of my conscience entered me yea with a spitting power and made to tremble the region of my breast which forced such way that many mazed considerings did throng and pressed in with this caution first methought i stood not in the smile of heaven who had commanded nature that my lady's womb if it conceived a male child by me should do no more offices of life to 't than the grave does to th' dead for her male issue or died where they were made or shortly after this world had aired them hence i took a thought this was a judgment on me that my kingdom well worthy the best heir o' th' world should not be gladded in 't by me then follows that i weighed the danger which my realms stood in by this my issue's fail and that gave to me many a groaning throe thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience i did steer toward this remedy whereupon we are now present here together that's to say i meant to rectify my conscience which i then did feel full sick and yet not well by all the reverend fathers of the land and doctors learnèd first i began in private with you my lord of lincoln you remember how under my oppression i did reek when i first moved you i have spoke long be pleased yourself to say how far you satisfied me i then moved you my lord of canterbury and got your leave to make this present summons unsolicited i left no reverend person in this court but by particular consent proceeded under your hands and seals therefore go on for no dislike i' th' world against the person of the good queen but the sharp thorny points of my allegèd reasons drives this forward prove but our marriage lawful by my life and kingly dignity we are contented to wear our mortal state to come with her katherine our queen before the primest creature that's paragoned o' th' world i may perceive these cardinals trifle with me i abhor this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome my learnèd and well belovèd servant cranmer prithee return with thy approach i know my comfort comes along break up the court i say set on what piles of wealth hath he accumulated to his own portion and what expense by th' hour seems to flow from him how i' th' name of thrift does he rake this together now my lords saw you the cardinal it may well be there is a mutiny in 's mind this morning papers of state he sent me to peruse as i required and wot you what i found there on my conscience put unwittingly  forsooth an inventory thus importing the several parcels of his plate his treasure rich stuffs and ornaments of household which i find at such proud rate that it outspeaks possession of a subject if we did think his contemplation were above the earth and fixed on spiritual object he should still dwell in his musings but i am afraid his thinkings are below the moon not worth his serious considering good my lord you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory of your best graces in your mind the which you were now running o'er you have scarce time to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span to keep your earthly audit sure in that i deem you an ill husband and am glad to have you therein my companion you have said well 'tis well said again and 'tis a kind of good deed to say well and yet words are no deeds my father loved you he said he did and with his deed did crown his word upon you since i had my office i have kept you next my heart have not alone employed you where high profits might come home but pared my present havings to bestow my bounties upon you have i not made you the prime man of the state i pray you tell me if what i now pronounce you have found true and if you may confess it say withal if you are bound to us or no what say you fairly answered a loyal and obedient subject is therein illustrated the honor of it does pay the act of it as i' th' contrary the foulness is the punishment i presume that as my hand has opened bounty to you my heart dropped love my power rained honor more on you than any so your hand and heart your brain and every function of your power should notwithstanding that your bond of duty as 'twere in love's particular be more to me your friend than any 'tis nobly spoken  take notice lords he has a loyal breast for you have seen him open 't read o'er this and after this and then to breakfast with what appetite you have charles i will play no

integrity is rooted in us thy friend give me thy hand stand up prithee let's walk now by my halidom what manner of man are you my lord i looked you would have given me your petition that i should have ta'en some pains to bring together yourself and your accusers and to have heard you without endurance further know you not how your state stands i' th' world with the whole world your enemies are many and not small their practices must bear the same proportion and not ever the justice and the truth o' th' question carries the due o' th' verdict with it at what ease might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt to swear against you such things have been done you are potently opposed and with a malice of as great size ween you of better luck i mean in perjured witness than your master whose minister you are whiles here he lived upon this naughty earth go to go to you take a precipice for no leap of danger and woo your own destruction be of good cheer they shall no more prevail than we give way to keep comfort to you and this morning see you do appear before them if they shall chance in charging you with matters to commit you the best persuasions to the contrary fail not to use and with what vehemency th' occasion shall instruct you if entreaties will render you no remedy this ring deliver them and your appeal to us there make before them look the good man weeps he's honest on mine honor god's blest mother i swear he is truehearted and a soul none better in my kingdom get you gone and do as i have bid you he has strangled his language in his tears now by thy looks i guess

another 'tis well there's one above 'em yet i had thought they had parted so much honesty among 'em  at least good manners as not thus to suffer a man of his place and so near our favor to dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures and at the door too like a post with packets by holy mary butts there's knavery let 'em alone and draw the curtain close we shall hear more anon you were ever good at sudden commendations bishop of winchester but know i come not to hear such flattery now and in my presence they are too thin and base to hide offenses to me you cannot reach you play the
