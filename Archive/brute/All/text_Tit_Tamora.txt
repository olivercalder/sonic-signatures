stay roman brethren gracious conqueror victorious titus rue the tears i shed a mother's tears in passion for her son and if thy sons were ever dear to thee o think my son to be as dear to me sufficeth not that we are brought to rome to beautify thy triumphs and return captive to thee and to thy roman yoke but must my sons be slaughtered in the streets for valiant doings in their country's cause o if to fight for king and commonweal were piety in thine it is in these andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods draw near them then in being merciful sweet mercy is nobility's true badge thrice noble titus spare my first born son o cruel irreligious piety and here in sight of heaven to rome i swear if saturnine advance the queen of goths she will a handmaid be to his desires a loving nurse a mother to his youth my worthy lord if ever tamora were gracious in those princely eyes of thine then hear me speak indifferently for all and at my suit sweet pardon what is past not so my lord the gods of rome forfend i should be author to dishonor you but on mine honor dare i undertake for good lord titus' innocence in all whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs then at my suit look graciously on him lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart my lord be ruled by me be won at last dissemble all your griefs and discontents you are but newly planted in your throne lest then the people and patricians too upon a just survey take titus' part and so supplant you for ingratitude which rome reputes to be a heinous sin yield at entreats and then let me alone i'll find a day to massacre them all and raze their faction and their family the cruel father and his traitorous sons to whom i sued for my dear son's life and make them know what 'tis to let a queen kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain come come sweet emperor come andronicus  take up this good old man and cheer the heart that dies in tempest of thy angry frown titus i am incorporate in rome a roman now adopted happily and must advise the emperor for his good this day all quarrels die andronicus  and let it be mine honor good my lord that i have reconciled your friends and you  for you prince bassianus i have passed my word and promise to the emperor that you will be more mild and tractable  and fear not lords and you lavinia by my advice all humbled on your knees you shall ask pardon of his majesty nay nay sweet emperor we must all be friends the tribune and his nephews kneel for grace i will not be denied sweetheart look back my lovely aaron wherefore look'st thou sad when everything doth make a gleeful boast the birds chant melody on every bush the snakes lies rollèd in the cheerful sun the green leaves quiver with the cooling wind and make a checkered shadow on the ground under their sweet shade aaron let us sit and whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds replying shrilly to the well tuned horns as if a double hunt were heard at once let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise and after conflict such as was supposed the wand'ring prince and dido once enjoyed when with a happy storm they were surprised and curtained with a counsel keeping cave we may each wreathèd in the other's arms our pastimes done possess a golden slumber whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds be unto us as is a nurse's song of lullaby to bring her babe asleep ah my sweet moor sweeter to me than life saucy controller of my private steps had i the power that some say dian had thy temples should be planted presently with horns as was acteon's and the hounds should drive upon thy new transformèd limbs unmannerly intruder as thou art why i have patience to endure all this have i not reason think you to look pale these two have ticed me hither to this place a barren detested vale you see it is the trees though summer yet forlorn and lean overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe here never shines the sun here nothing breeds unless the nightly owl or fatal raven and when they showed me this abhorrèd pit they told me here at dead time of the night a thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins would make such fearful and confusèd cries as any mortal body hearing it should straight fall mad or else die suddenly no sooner had they told this hellish tale but straight they told me they would bind me here unto the body of a dismal yew and leave me to this miserable death and then they called me foul adulteress lascivious goth and all the bitterest terms that ever ear did hear to such effect and had you not by wondrous fortune come this vengeance on me had they executed revenge it as you love your mother's life or be you not henceforth called my children give me the poniard you shall know my boys your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong but when you have the honey you desire let not this wasp outlive us both to sting i will not hear her speak away with her i know not what it means away with her hadst thou in person ne'er offended me even for his sake am i pitiless  remember boys i poured forth tears in vain to save your brother from the sacrifice but fierce andronicus would not relent therefore away with her and use her as you will the worse to her the better loved of me what begg'st thou then fond woman let me go so should i rob my sweet sons of their fee no let them satisfy their lust on thee farewell my sons see that you make her sure ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed till all the andronici be made away now will i hence to seek my lovely moor and let my spleenful sons this trull deflower where is my lord the king where is thy brother bassianus then all too late i bring this fatal writ the complot of this timeless tragedy and wonder greatly that man's face can fold in pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny what are they in this pit o wondrous thing how easily murder is discoverèd andronicus himself did take it up andronicus i will entreat the king fear not thy sons they shall do well enough my gracious lord my lovely saturnine lord of my life commander of my thoughts calm thee and bear the faults of titus' age th' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heart and rather comfort his distressèd plight than prosecute the meanest or the best for these contempts why thus it shall become high witted tamora to gloze with all but titus i have touched thee to the quick thy lifeblood out if aaron now be wise then is all safe the anchor in the port how now good fellow wouldst thou speak with us empress i am but yonder sits the emperor come sirrah you must be hanged why should you fear is not your city strong king be thy thoughts imperious like thy name is the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it the eagle suffers little birds to sing and is not careful what they mean thereby knowing that with the shadow of his wings he can at pleasure stint their melody even so mayst thou the giddy men of rome then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor i will enchant the old andronicus with words more sweet and yet more dangerous than baits to fish or honey stalks to sheep whenas the one is wounded with the bait the other rotted with delicious feed if tamora entreat him then he will for i can smooth and fill his agèd ears with golden promises that were his heart almost impregnable his old ears deaf yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue go thou before to be our ambassador say that the emperor requests a parley of warlike lucius and appoint the meeting even at his father's house the old andronicus now will i to that old andronicus and temper him with all the art i have to pluck proud lucius from the warlike goths and now sweet emperor be blithe again and bury all thy fear in my devices thus in this strange and sad habiliment i will encounter with andronicus and say i am revenge sent from below to join with him and right his heinous wrongs knock at his study where they say he keeps to ruminate strange plots of dire revenge tell him revenge is come to join with him and work confusion on his enemies titus i am come to talk with thee if thou didst know me thou wouldst talk with me know thou sad man i am not tamora she is thy enemy and i thy friend i am revenge sent from th' infernal kingdom to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind by working wreakful vengeance on thy foes come down and welcome me to this world's light confer with me of murder and of death there's not a hollow cave or lurking place no vast obscurity or misty vale where bloody murder or detested rape can couch for fear but i will find them out and in their ears tell them my dreadful name revenge which makes the foul offender quake i am therefore come down and welcome me these are my ministers and come with me rape and murder therefore callèd so 'cause they take vengeance of such kind of men this closing with him fits his lunacy whate'er i forge to feed his brainsick humors do you uphold and maintain in your speeches for now he firmly takes me for revenge and being credulous in this mad thought i'll make him send for lucius his son and whilst i at a banquet hold him sure i'll find some cunning practice out of hand to scatter and disperse the giddy goths or at the least make them his enemies see here he comes and i must ply my theme what wouldst thou have us do andronicus show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong and i will be revengèd on them all well hast thou lessoned us this shall we do but would it please thee good andronicus to send for lucius thy thrice valiant son who leads towards rome a band of warlike goths and bid him come and banquet at thy house when he is here even at thy solemn feast i will bring in the empress and her sons the emperor himself and all thy foes and at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel and on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart what says andronicus to this device now will i hence about thy business and take my ministers along with me what say you boys will you abide with him whiles i go tell my lord the emperor how i have governed our determined jest yield to his humor smooth and speak him fair and tarry with him till i turn again farewell andronicus revenge now goes to lay a complot to betray thy foes we are beholding to you good andronicus why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus
