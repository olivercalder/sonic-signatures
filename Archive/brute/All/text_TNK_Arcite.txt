dear palamon dearer in love than blood and our prime cousin yet unhardened in the crimes of nature let us leave the city thebes and the temptings in 't before we further sully our gloss of youth and here to keep in abstinence we shame as in incontinence for not to swim i' th' aid o' th' current were almost to sink at least to frustrate striving and to follow the common stream 'twould bring us to an eddy where we should turn or drown if labor through our gain but life and weakness are you not out meet you no ruin but the soldier in the cranks and turns of thebes you did begin as if you met decays of many kinds perceive you none that do arouse your pity but th' unconsidered soldier 'tis not this i did begin to speak of this is virtue of no respect in thebes i spake of thebes  how dangerous if we will keep our honors it is for our residing where every evil hath a good color where every seeming good's a certain evil where not to be e'en jump as they are here were to be strangers and such things to be mere monsters our uncle creon clear spirited cousin let's leave his court that we may nothing share of his loud infamy for our milk will relish of the pasture and we must be vile or disobedient not his kinsmen in blood unless in quality let him approach but that we fear the gods in him he brings not a jot of terror to us yet what man thirds his own worth the case is each of ours  when that his action's dregged with mind assured 'tis bad he goes about so we must is 't said this war's afoot or it shall be on fail of some condition let th' event that never erring arbitrator tell us when we know all ourselves and let us follow the becking of our chance how do you sir i believe it and to that destiny have patiently laid up my hour to come no palamon those hopes are prisoners with us here we are and here the graces of our youths must wither like a too timely spring here age must find us and which is heaviest palamon unmarried the sweet embraces of a loving wife loaden with kisses armed with thousand cupids shall never clasp our necks no issue know us  no figures of ourselves shall we e'er see to glad our age and like young eagles teach 'em boldly to gaze against bright arms and say remember what your fathers were and conquer the fair eyed maids shall weep our banishments and in their songs curse ever blinded fortune till she for shame see what a wrong she has done to youth and nature this is all our world we shall know nothing here but one another hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes the vine shall grow but we shall never see it summer shall come and with her all delights but dead cold winter must inhabit here still yet cousin even from the bottom of these miseries from all that fortune can inflict upon us i see two comforts rising two mere blessings if the gods please to hold here a brave patience and the enjoying of our griefs together whilst palamon is with me let me perish if i think this our prison shall we make worthy uses of this place that all men hate so much let's think this prison holy sanctuary to keep us from corruption of worse men we are young and yet desire the ways of honor that liberty and common conversation the poison of pure spirits might like women woo us to wander from what worthy blessing can be but our imaginations may make it ours and here being thus together we are an endless mine to one another we are one another's wife ever begetting new births of love we are father friends acquaintance we are in one another families i am your heir and you are mine this place is our inheritance no hard oppressor dare take this from us here with a little patience we shall live long and loving no surfeits seek us the hand of war hurts none here nor the seas swallow their youth were we at liberty a wife might part us lawfully or business quarrels consume us envy of ill men crave our acquaintance i might sicken cousin where you should never know it and so perish without your noble hand to close mine eyes or prayers to the gods a thousand chances were we from hence would sever us i would hear you still sure there cannot till our deaths it cannot and after death our spirits shall be led to those that love eternally speak on sir pray forward will you go forward cousin cousin cousin how do you sir why palamon why what's the matter man ha she is wondrous fair 'tis a rare one yes a matchless beauty i cannot tell what you have done i have beshrew mine eyes for 't now i feel my shackles who would not before my liberty that's nothing i saw her too i will not as you do to worship her as she is heavenly and a blessèd goddess i love her as a woman to enjoy her so both may love not love at all who shall deny me yes i love her and if the lives of all my name lay on it i must do so i love her with my soul if that will lose you farewell palamon i say again i love and in loving her maintain i am as worthy and as free a lover and have as just a title to her beauty as any palamon or any living that is a man's son yes and have found me so why are you moved thus let me deal coldly with you am not i part of your blood part of your soul you have told me that i was palamon and you were arcite am not i liable to those affections those joys griefs angers fears my friend shall suffer why then would you deal so cunningly so strangely so unlike a noble kinsman to love alone speak truly do you think me unworthy of her sight because another first sees the enemy shall i stand still and let mine honor down and never charge but say that one had rather combat me you are mad fie sir you play the child extremely i will love her i must i ought to do so and i dare and all this justly thou dar'st not fool thou canst not thou art feeble put my head out i'll throw my body out and leap the garden when i see her next and pitch between her arms to anger thee do i am ready keeper banished the kingdom 'tis a benefit a mercy i must thank 'em for but banished the free enjoying of that face i die for o 'twas a studied punishment a death beyond imagination such a vengeance that were i old and wicked all my sins could never pluck upon me palamon thou hast the start now thou shalt stay and see her bright eyes break each morning 'gainst thy window and let in life into thee thou shalt feed upon the sweetness of a noble beauty that nature ne'er exceeded nor ne'er shall good gods what happiness has palamon twenty to one he'll come to speak to her and if she be as gentle as she's fair i know she's his he has a tongue will tame tempests and make the wild rocks wanton come what can come the worst is death i will not leave the kingdom i know mine own is but a heap of ruins and no redress there if i go he has her i am resolved another shape shall make me or end my fortunes either way i am happy i'll see her and be near her or no more by your leaves honest friends pray you whither go you yes 'tis a question to me that know not not far sir are there such games today what pastimes are they not yet sir this is an offered opportunity i durst not wish for well i could have wrestled  the best men called it excellent and run swifter than wind upon a field of corn curling the wealthy ears never flew i'll venture and in some poor disguise be there who knows whether my brows may not be girt with garlands and happiness prefer me to a place where i may ever dwell in sight of her i am proud to please you this but far off prince my father said so and to those gentle uses gave me life his youngest sir a little of all noble qualities i could have kept a hawk and well have hallowed to a deep cry of dogs i dare not praise my feat in horsemanship yet they that knew me would say it was my best piece last and greatest i would be thought a soldier noble theseus to purchase name and do my ablest service to such a well found wonder as thy worth for only in thy court of all the world dwells fair eyed honor sir you're a noble giver dearest beauty thus let me seal my vowed faith when your servant your most unworthy creature but offends you command him die he shall i like him better prince i shall not then freeze in my saddle if i do not let me find that my father ever

will 't please you arm sir or if you feel yourself not fitting yet and furnished with your old strength i'll stay cousin and ev'ry day discourse you into health as i am spared your person i am friends

and spare not i'll give you cause sweet cousin that was a very good one and that day i well remember you outdid me cousin i never saw such valor when you charged upon the left wing of the enemy i spurred hard to come up and under me i had a right good horse yes but all was vainly labored in me you outwent me nor could my wishes reach you yet a little i did by imitation when i saw you charge first methought i heard a dreadful clap of thunder break from the troop no no 'tis well now i am perfect take my sword i hold it better and me my love is there aught else to say here palamon this hand shall never more come near thee with such friendship if i fall curse me and say i was a coward for none but such dare die in these just trials once more farewell my cousin lo cousin lo our folly has undone us this is the duke a hunting as i told you if we be found we are wretched o retire for honor's sake and safely presently into your bush again sir we shall find too many hours to die in gentle cousin if you be seen you perish instantly for breaking prison and i if you reveal me for my contempt then all the world will scorn us and say we had a noble difference but base disposers of it you are not mad then come what can come thou shalt know palamon i dare as well die as discourse or sleep only this fears me the law will have the honor of our ends have at thy life we seek not thy breath of mercy theseus 'tis to me a thing as soon to die as thee to say it and no more moved where this man calls me traitor let me say thus much if in love be treason in service of so excellent a beauty as i love most and in that faith will perish as i have brought my life here to confirm it as i have served her truest worthiest as i dare kill this cousin that denies it so let me be most traitor and you please me for scorning thy edict duke ask that lady why she is fair and why her eyes command me stay here to love her and if she say traitor i am a villain fit to lie unburied no never duke 'tis worse to me than begging to take my life so basely though i think i never shall enjoy her yet i'll preserve the honor of affection and die for her make death a devil with all our souls any death thou canst invent duke if she refuse me yet my grave will wed me and soldiers sing my epitaph i embrace you i am in labor to push your name your ancient love our kindred out of my memory and i' th' selfsame place to seat something i would confound so hoist we the sails that must these vessels port even where the heavenly limiter pleases one farewell farewell sir knights kinsmen lovers yea my sacrifices

lions and the breath of tigers yea the fierceness too yea the speed also to go on i mean else wish we to be snails you know my prize must be dragged out of blood force and great feat must put my garland on where she sticks the queen of flowers our intercession then must be to him that makes the camp a cistern brimmed with the blood of men give me your aid and bend your spirits towards him thou mighty one that with thy power hast turned green neptune into purple whose approach comets prewarn whose havoc in vast field unearthèd skulls proclaim whose breath blows down the teeming ceres' foison who dost pluck with hand armipotent from forth blue clouds the masoned turrets that both mak'st and break'st the stony girths of cities me thy pupil youngest follower of thy drum instruct this day with military skill that to thy laud i may advance my streamer and by thee be styled the lord o' th' day give me great mars some token of thy pleasure o great corrector of enormous times shaker of o'er rank states thou grand decider of dusty and old titles that heal'st with blood the earth when it is sick and cur'st the world o' th' pleurisy of people i do take thy signs auspiciously and in thy name to my design march boldly let us go emily to buy you i have lost what's dearest to me save what is bought and yet i purchase cheaply as i do rate your value take emilia and with her all the
