new plays and maidenheads are near akin much followed both for both much money giv'n if they stand sound and well and a good play whose modest scenes blush on his marriage day and shake to lose his honor is like her that after holy tie and first night's stir yet still is modesty and still retains more of the maid to sight than husband's pains we pray our play may be so for i am sure it has a noble breeder and a pure a learn√®d and a poet never went more famous yet 'twixt po and silver trent chaucer of all admired the story gives there constant to eternity it lives if we let fall the nobleness of this and the first sound this child hear be a hiss how will it shake the bones of that good man and make him cry from underground o fan from me the witless chaff of such a writer that blasts my bays and my famed works makes lighter than robin hood this is the fear we bring for to say truth it were an endless thing and too ambitious to aspire to him weak as we are and almost breathless swim in this deep water do but you hold out your helping hands and we shall tack about and something do to save us you shall hear scenes though below his art may yet appear worth two hours' travel to his bones sweet sleep content to you if this play do not keep a little dull time from us we perceive our losses fall so thick we must needs leave
