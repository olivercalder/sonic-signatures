that our kingdom's earth should not be soiled with that dear blood which it hath fosterèd and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect of civil wounds plowed up with neighbor's sword and for we think the eagle wingèd pride of sky aspiring and ambitious thoughts with rival hating envy set on you to wake our peace which in our country's cradle draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep which so roused up with boist'rous untuned drums with harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray and grating shock of wrathful iron arms might from our quiet confines fright fair peace and make us wade even in our kindred's blood therefore we banish you our territories you cousin hereford upon pain of life till twice five summers have enriched our fields shall not regreet our fair dominions but tread the stranger paths of banishment norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom which i with some unwillingness pronounce the sly slow hours shall not determinate the dateless limit of thy dear exile the

plucked four away six frozen winters spent return with welcome home from banishment why uncle thou hast many years to live thy son is banished upon good advice whereto thy tongue a party verdict gave why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour cousin farewell and uncle bid him so six years we banish him and he shall go we did observe cousin aumerle how far brought you high hereford on his way and say what store of parting tears were shed what said our cousin when you parted with him he is our cousin cousin but 'tis doubt when time shall call him home from banishment whether our kinsman come to see his friends ourself and bushy bagot here and green observed his courtship to the common people how he did seem to dive into their hearts with humble and familiar courtesy what reverence he did throw away on slaves wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles and patient underbearing of his fortune as 'twere to banish their affects with him off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench a brace of draymen bid god speed him well and had the tribute of his supple knee with thanks my countrymen my loving friends as were our england in reversion his and he our subjects' next degree in hope we will

after to supply our wants for we will make for ireland presently bushy what news where lies he now put it god in the physician's mind to help him to his grave immediately the lining of his coffers shall make coats to deck our soldiers for these irish wars come gentlemen let's all go visit him pray god we may make haste and come too late what comfort man how is 't with agèd gaunt can sick men play so nicely with their names should dying men flatter with those that live thou now a dying sayest thou flatterest me i am in health i breathe and see thee ill a lunatic lean witted fool presuming on an ague's privilege darest with thy frozen admonition make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood with fury from his native residence now by my seat's right royal majesty wert thou not brother to great edward's son this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders and let them die that age and sullens have for both hast thou and both become the grave right you say true as hereford's love so his as theirs so mine and all be as it is what says he the ripest fruit first falls and so doth he his time is spent our pilgrimage must be so much for that now for our irish wars we must supplant those rough rugheaded kern which live like venom where no venom else but only they have privilege to live and for these great affairs do ask some charge towards our assistance we do seize to us the plate coin revenues and movables whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possessed why uncle what's the matter think what you will we seize into our hands his plate his goods his money and his lands go bushy to the earl of wiltshire straight bid him repair to us to ely house to see this business tomorrow next we will for ireland and 'tis time i trow and we create in absence of ourself our uncle york lord governor of england for he is just and always loved us well  come on our queen tomorrow must we part be merry for our time of stay is short barkloughly castle call they this at hand needs must i like it well i weep for joy to stand upon my kingdom once again dear earth i do salute thee with my hand though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs as a long parted mother with her child plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth and do thee favors with my royal hands feed not thy sovereign's foe my gentle earth nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom and heavy gaited toads lie in their way doing annoyance to the treacherous feet which with usurping steps do trample thee yield stinging nettles to mine enemies and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a mortal touch throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies mock not my senseless conjuration lords this earth shall have a feeling and these stones prove armèd soldiers ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellion's arms discomfortable cousin know'st thou not that when the searching eye of heaven is hid behind the globe that lights the lower world then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen in murders and in outrage boldly here but when from under this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole then murders treasons and detested sins the cloak of night being plucked from off their backs stand bare and naked trembling at themselves so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke who all this while hath reveled in the night whilst we were wand'ring with the antipodes shall see us rising in our throne the east his treasons will sit blushing in his face not able to endure the sight of day but self affrighted tremble at his sin not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king the breath of worldly men cannot depose the deputy elected by the lord for every man that bolingbroke hath pressed to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown god for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel then if angels fight weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right welcome my lord how far off lies your power but now the blood of twenty thousand men did triumph in my face and they are fled and till so much blood thither come again have i not reason to look pale and dead all souls that will be safe fly from my side for time hath set a blot upon my pride i had forgot myself am i not king awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest is not the king's name twenty thousand names arm arm my name a puny subject strikes at thy great glory look not to the ground you favorites of a king are we not high high be our thoughts i know my uncle york hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here mine ear is open and my heart prepared the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold say is my kingdom lost why 'twas my care and what loss is it to be rid of care strives bolingbroke to be as great as we greater he shall not be if he serve god we'll serve him too and be his fellow so revolt our subjects that we cannot mend they break their faith to god as well as us cry woe destruction ruin and decay the worst is death and death will have his day too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot what is become of bushy where is green that they have let the dangerous enemy measure our confines with such peaceful steps if we prevail their heads shall pay for it i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke o villains vipers damned without redemption dogs easily won to fawn on any man snakes in my heart blood warmed that sting my heart three judases each one thrice worse than judas would they make peace terrible hell make war upon their spotted souls for this no matter where of comfort no man speak let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth let's choose executors and talk of wills and yet not so for what can we bequeath save our deposèd bodies to the ground our lands our lives and all are bolingbroke's and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our bones for god's sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings  how some have been deposed some slain in war some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed some poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed all murdered for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp allowing him a breath a little scene to monarchize be feared and kill with looks infusing him with self and vain conceit as if this flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable and humored thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castle wall and farewell king cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence throw away respect tradition form and ceremonious duty for you have but mistook me all this while i live with bread like you feel want taste grief need friends subjected thus how can you say to me i am a king thou chid'st me well proud bolingbroke i come to change blows with thee for our day of doom  this ague fit of fear is overblown an easy task it is to win our own  say scroop where lies our uncle with his power speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour thou hast said enough beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth of that sweet way i was in to despair what say you now what comfort have we now by heaven i'll hate him everlastingly that bids me be of comfort anymore go to flint castle there i'll pine away a king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey that power i have discharge and let them go to ear the land that hath some hope to grow for i have none let no man speak again to alter this for counsel is but vain he does me double wrong that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue discharge my followers let them hence away from richard's night to bolingbroke's fair day we are amazed and thus long have we stood to watch the fearful bending of thy knee because we thought ourself thy lawful king an if we be how dare thy joints forget to pay their awful duty to our presence if we be not show us the hand of god that hath dismissed us from our stewardship for well we know no hand of blood and bone can gripe the sacred handle of our scepter unless he do profane steal or usurp and though you think that all as you have done have torn their souls by turning them from us and we are barren and bereft of friends yet know my master god omnipotent is mustering in his clouds on our behalf armies of pestilence and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of my precious crown tell bolingbroke for yon methinks he stands  that every stride he makes upon my land is dangerous treason he is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war but ere the crown he looks for live in peace ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons shall ill become the flower of england's face change the complexion of her maid pale peace to scarlet indignation and bedew her pastures' grass with faithful english blood northumberland say thus the king returns his noble cousin is right welcome hither and all the number of his fair demands shall be accomplished without contradiction with all the gracious utterance thou hast speak to his gentle hearing kind commends we do debase ourselves cousin do we not to look so poorly and to speak so fair shall we call back northumberland and send defiance to the traitor and so die o god o god that e'er this tongue of mine that laid the sentence of dread banishment on yon proud man should take it off again with words of sooth o that i were as great as is my grief or lesser than my name or that i could forget what i have been or not remember what i must be now swell'st thou proud heart i'll give thee scope to beat since foes have scope to beat both thee and me what must the king do now must he submit the king shall do it must he be deposed the king shall be contented must he lose the name of king i' god's name let it go i'll give my jewels for a set of beads my gorgeous palace for a hermitage my gay apparel for an almsman's gown my figured goblets for a dish of wood my scepter for a palmer's walking staff my subjects for a pair of carvèd saints and my large kingdom for a little grave a little little grave an obscure grave or i'll be buried in the king's highway some way of common trade where subjects' feet may hourly trample on their sovereign's head for on my heart they tread now whilst i live and buried once why not upon my head aumerle thou weep'st my tender hearted cousin we'll make foul weather with despisèd tears our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn and make a dearth in this revolting land or shall we play the wantons with our woes and make some pretty match with shedding tears as thus to drop them still upon one place till they have fretted us a pair of graves within the earth and therein laid there lies two kinsmen digged their graves with weeping eyes would not this ill do well well well i see i talk but idly and you laugh at me most mighty prince my lord northumberland what says king bolingbroke will his majesty give richard leave to live till richard die you make a leg and bolingbroke says ay down down i come like glist'ring phaëton wanting the manage of unruly jades in the base court base court where kings grow base to come at traitors' calls and do them grace in the base court come down down court down king for nightowls shriek where mounting larks should sing fair cousin you debase your princely knee to make the base earth proud with kissing it me rather had my heart might feel your love than my unpleased eye see your courtesy up cousin up your heart is up i know thus high at least although your knee be low your own is yours and i am yours and all well you deserve they well deserve to have that know the strong'st and surest way to get  uncle give me your hands nay dry your eyes tears show their love but want their remedies  cousin i am too young to be your father though you are old enough to be my heir what you will have i'll give and willing too for do we must what force will have us do set on towards london cousin is it so then i must not say no alack why am i sent for to a king before i have shook off the regal thoughts wherewith i reigned i hardly yet have learned to insinuate flatter bow and bend my knee give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me to this submission yet i well remember the favors of these men were they not mine did they not sometime cry all hail to me so judas did to christ but he in twelve found truth in all but one i in twelve thousand none god save the king will no man say amen am i both priest and clerk well then amen god save the king although i be not he and yet amen if heaven do think him me to do what service am i sent for hither give me the crown here cousin seize the crown here cousin on this side my hand on that side thine now is this golden crown like a deep well that owes two buckets filling one another the emptier ever dancing in the air the other down unseen and full of water that bucket down and full of tears am i drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high my crown i am but still my griefs are mine you may my glories and my state depose but not my griefs still am i king of those your cares set up do not pluck my cares down my care is loss of care by old care done your care is gain of care by new care won the cares i give i have though given away they 'tend the crown yet still with me they stay ay no no ay for i must nothing be therefore no no for i resign to thee now mark me how i will undo myself i give this heavy weight from off my head and this unwieldy scepter from my hand the pride of kingly sway from out my heart with mine own tears i wash away my balm with mine own hands i give away my crown with mine own tongue deny my sacred state with mine own breath release all duteous oaths all pomp and majesty i do forswear my manors rents revenues i forgo my acts decrees and statutes i deny god pardon all oaths that are broke to me god keep all vows unbroke are made to thee make me that nothing have with nothing grieved and thou with all pleased that hast all achieved long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit and soon lie richard in an earthy pit god save king henry unkinged richard says and send him many years of sunshine days what more remains must i do so and must i ravel out my weaved up follies gentle northumberland if thy offenses were upon record would it not shame thee in so fair a troop to read a lecture of them if thou wouldst there shouldst thou find one heinous article containing the deposing of a king and cracking the strong warrant of an oath marked with a blot damned in the book of heaven  nay all of you that stand and look upon me whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself though some of you with pilate wash your hands showing an outward pity yet you pilates have here delivered me to my sour cross and water cannot wash away your sin mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see and yet salt water blinds them not so much but they can see a sort of traitors here nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself i find myself a traitor with the rest for i have given here my soul's consent t' undeck the pompous body of a king made glory base and sovereignty a slave proud majesty a subject state a peasant no lord of thine thou haught insulting man nor no man's lord i have no name no title no not that name was given me at the font but 'tis usurped alack the heavy day that i have worn so many winters out and know not now what name to call myself o that i were a mockery king of snow standing before the sun of bolingbroke to melt myself away in water drops  good king great king and yet not greatly good an if my word be sterling yet in england let it command a mirror hither straight that it may show me what a face i have since it is bankrupt of his majesty fiend thou torments me ere i come to hell they shall be satisfied i'll read enough when i do see the very book indeed where all my sins are writ and that's myself give me that glass and therein will i read no deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck so many blows upon this face of mine and made no deeper wounds o flatt'ring glass like to my followers in prosperity thou dost beguile me was this face the face that every day under his household roof did keep ten thousand men was this the face that like the sun did make beholders wink is this the face which faced so many follies that was at last outfaced by bolingbroke a brittle glory shineth in this face as brittle as the glory is the face for there it is cracked in an hundred shivers  mark silent king the moral of this sport how soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face say that again the shadow of my sorrow ha let's see 'tis very true my grief lies all within and these external manners of laments are merely shadows to the unseen grief that swells with silence in the tortured soul there lies the substance and i thank thee king for thy great bounty that not only giv'st me cause to wail but teachest me the way how to lament the cause i'll beg one boon and then be gone and trouble you no more shall i obtain it fair cousin i am greater than a king for when i was a king my flatterers were then but subjects being now a subject i have a king here to my flatterer being so great i have no need to beg and shall i have then give me leave to go whither you will so i were from your sights o good convey conveyers are you all that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall join not with grief fair woman do not so to make my end too sudden learn good soul to think our former state a happy dream from which awaked the truth of what we are shows us but this i am sworn brother sweet to grim necessity and he and i will keep a league till death hie thee to france and cloister thee in some religious house our holy lives must win a new world's crown which our profane hours here have thrown down a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts i had been still a happy king of men good sometime queen prepare thee hence for france think i am dead and that even here thou takest as from my deathbed thy last living leave in winter's tedious nights sit by the fire with good old folks and let them tell thee tales of woeful ages long ago betid and ere thou bid good night to quite their griefs tell thou the lamentable tale of me and send the hearers weeping to their beds forwhy the senseless brands will sympathize the heavy accent of thy moving tongue and in compassion weep the fire out and some will mourn in ashes some coal black for the deposing of a rightful king northumberland thou ladder wherewithal the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne the time shall not be many hours of age more than it is ere foul sin gathering head shall break into corruption thou shalt think though he divide the realm and give thee half it is too little helping him to all he shall think that thou which knowest the way to plant unrightful kings wilt know again being ne'er so little urged another way to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne the love of wicked men converts to fear that fear to hate and hate turns one or both to worthy danger and deservèd death doubly divorced bad men you violate a twofold marriage twixt my crown and me and then betwixt me and my married wife let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me and yet not so for with a kiss 'twas made  part us northumberland i towards the north where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime my wife to france from whence set forth in pomp she came adornèd hither like sweet may sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart so two together weeping make one woe weep thou for me in france i for thee here better far off than near be ne'er the near go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans twice for one step i'll groan the way being short and piece the way out with a heavy heart come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief since wedding it there is such length in grief one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart we make woe wanton with this fond delay once more adieu the rest let sorrow say i have been studying how i may compare this prison where i live unto the world and for because the world is populous and here is not a creature but myself i cannot do it yet i'll hammer it out my brain i'll prove the female to my soul my soul the father and these two beget a generation of still breeding thoughts and these same thoughts people this little world in humors like the people of this world for no thought is contented the better sort as thoughts of things divine are intermixed with scruples and do set the word itself against the word as thus come little ones and then again it is as hard to come as for a camel to thread the postern of a small needle's eye thoughts tending to ambition they do plot unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails may tear a passage through the flinty ribs of this hard world my ragged prison walls and for they cannot die in their own pride thoughts tending to content flatter themselves that they are not the first of fortune's slaves nor shall not be the last like silly beggars who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame that many have and others must sit there and in this thought they find a kind of ease bearing their own misfortunes on the back of such as have before endured the like thus play i in one person many people and none contented sometimes am i king then treasons make me wish myself a beggar and so i am then crushing penury persuades me i was better when a king then am i kinged again and by and by think that i am unkinged by bolingbroke and straight am nothing but whate'er i be nor i nor any man that but man is with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased with being nothing music do i hear ha ha keep time how sour sweet music is when time is broke and no proportion kept so is it in the music of men's lives and here have i the daintiness of ear to check time broke in a disordered string but for the concord of my state and time had not an ear to hear my true time broke i wasted time and now doth time waste me for now hath time made me his numb'ring clock my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch whereto my finger like a dial's point is pointing still in cleansing them from tears now sir the sound that tells what hour it is are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans show minutes times and hours but my time runs posting on in bolingbroke's proud joy while i stand fooling here his jack of the clock this music mads me let it sound no more for though it have holp madmen to their wits in me it seems it will make wise men mad yet blessing on his heart that gives it me for 'tis a sign of love and love to richard is a strange brooch in this all hating world thanks noble peer the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear what art thou and how comest thou hither where no man never comes but that sad dog that brings me food to make misfortune live rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend how went he under him so proud that bolingbroke was on his back that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand this hand hath made him proud with clapping him would he not stumble would he not fall down since pride must have a fall and break the neck of that proud man that did usurp his back forgiveness horse why do i rail on thee since thou created to be awed by man wast born to bear i was not made a horse and yet i bear a burden like an ass spurred galled and tired by jauncing bolingbroke if thou love me 'tis time thou wert away taste of it first as thou art wont to do the devil take henry of lancaster and thee patience is stale and i am weary of it how now what means death in this rude assault villain thy own hand yields thy death's instrument go thou and fill another room in hell that hand shall burn in never quenching fire that staggers thus my person exton thy fierce hand hath with the king's blood stained the king's own land mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die
