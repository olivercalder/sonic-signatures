woman and i will do as we may i do beg your good will in this case in isbel's case and mine own service is no heritage and i think i shall never have the blessing of god till i have issue o' my body for they say bairns are blessings my poor body madam requires it i am driven on by the flesh and he must needs go that the devil drives faith madam i have other holy reasons such as they are i have been madam a wicked creature as you and all flesh and blood are and indeed i do marry that i may repent i am out o' friends madam and i hope to have friends for my wife's sake you're shallow madam in great friends for the knaves come to do that for me which i am aweary of he that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop if i be his cuckold he's my drudge he that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend ergo he that kisses my wife is my friend if men could be contented to be what they are there were no fear in marriage for young charbon the puritan and old poysam the papist howsome'er their hearts are severed in religion their heads are both one they may jowl horns together like any deer i' th' herd a prophet i madam and i speak the truth the next way for i the ballad will repeat which men full true shall find your marriage comes by destiny your cuckoo sings by kind was this fair face the cause quoth she why the grecians sackèd troy fond done done fond was this king priam's joy with that she sighèd as she stood with that she sighèd as she stood and gave this sentence then among nine bad if one be good among nine bad if one be good there's yet one good in ten one good woman in ten madam which is a purifying o' th' song would god would serve the world so all the year we'd find no fault with the tithe woman if i were the parson one in ten quoth he an we might have a good woman born but or every blazing star or at an earthquake 'twould mend the lottery well a man may draw his heart out ere he pluck one that man should be at woman's command and yet no hurt done though honesty be no puritan yet it will do no hurt it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart i am going forsooth the business is for helen to come hither i will show myself highly fed and lowly taught i know my business is but to the court truly madam if god have lent a man any manners he may easily put it off at court he that cannot make a leg put off 's cap kiss his hand and say nothing has neither leg hands lip nor cap and indeed such a fellow to say precisely were not for the court but for me i have an answer will serve all men it is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks the pin buttock the quatch buttock the brawn buttock or any buttock as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney as your french crown for your taffety punk as tib's rush for tom's forefinger as a pancake for shrove tuesday a morris for may day as the nail to his hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave as the nun's lip to the friar's mouth nay as the pudding to his skin from below your duke to beneath your constable it will fit any question but a trifle neither in good faith if the learned should speak truth of it here it is and all that belongs to 't ask me if i am a courtier it shall do you no harm to learn o lord sir there's a simple putting off more more a hundred of them o lord sir thick thick spare not me o lord sir nay put me to 't i warrant you o lord sir spare not me i ne'er had worse luck in my life in my o lord sir i see things may serve long but not serve ever o lord sir why there 't serves well again not much commendation to them most fruitfully i am there before my legs she is not well but yet she has her health she's very merry but yet she is not well but thanks be given she's very well and wants nothing i' th' world but yet she is not well truly she's very well indeed but for two things one that she's not in heaven whither god send her quickly the other that she's in earth from whence god send her quickly so that you had her wrinkles and i her money i would she did as you say marry you are the wiser man for many a man's tongue shakes out his master's undoing to say nothing to do nothing to know nothing and to have nothing is to be a great part of your title which is within a very little of nothing you should have said sir before a knave thou 'rt a knave that's before me thou 'rt a knave this had been truth sir did you find me in yourself sir or were you taught to find me the search sir was profitable and much fool may you find in you even to the world's pleasure and the increase of laughter by my troth i take my young lord to be a very melancholy man why he will look upon his boot and sing mend the ruff and sing ask questions and sing pick his teeth and sing i know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song i have no mind to isbel since i was at court our old lings and our isbels o' th' country are nothing like your old ling and your isbels o' th' court the brains of my cupid's knocked out and i begin to love as an old man loves money with no stomach e'en that you have there o madam yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady nay there is some comfort in the news some comfort your son will not be killed so soon as i thought he would so say i madam if he run away as i hear he does the danger is in standing to 't that's the loss of men though it be the getting of children here they come will tell you more for my part i only hear your son was run away indeed sir she was the sweet marjoram of the salad or rather the herb of grace i am no great nebuchadnezzar sir i have not much skill in grass a fool sir at a woman's service and a knave at a man's i would cozen the man of his wife and do his service and i would give his wife my bauble sir to do her service at your service why sir if i cannot serve you i can serve as great a prince as you are faith sir he has an english name but his phys'nomy is more hotter in france than there the black prince sir alias the prince of darkness alias the devil i am a woodland fellow sir that always loved a great fire and the master i speak of ever keeps a good fire but sure he is the prince of the world let his nobility remain in 's court i am for the house with the narrow gate which i take to be too little for pomp to enter some that humble themselves may but the many will be too chill and tender and they'll be for the flow'ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire if i put any tricks upon 'em sir they shall be jades' tricks which are their own right by the law of nature o madam yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet on 's face whether there be a scar under 't or no the velvet knows but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half but his right cheek is worn bare but it is your carbonadoed face 'faith there's a dozen of 'em with delicate fine hats and most courteous feathers which bow the head and nod at every man truly fortune's displeasure is but sluttish if it smell so strongly as thou speak'st of i will henceforth eat no fish of fortune's butt'ring prithee allow the wind indeed sir if your metaphor stink i will stop my nose or against any man's metaphor prithee get thee further foh prithee stand away a paper from fortune's close stool to give to a nobleman look here he comes himself here is a purr of fortune's sir or of fortune's cat but not a musk cat that has fall'n into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure and as he says is muddied withal pray you sir use the carp as you may for he looks like a poor decayed ingenious foolish rascally knave i do pity his distress in my smiles of comfort and leave him to your lordship
