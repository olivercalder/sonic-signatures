fellow of much license let him be called before us away with her to prison  go to no more words provost my brother angelo will not be altered claudio must die tomorrow let him be furnished with divines and have all charitable preparation if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be so with him good even good father of whence are you what news abroad i' th' world one that above all other
