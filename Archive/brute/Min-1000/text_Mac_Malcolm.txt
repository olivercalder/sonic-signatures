this is the sergeant who like a good and hardy soldier fought 'gainst my captivity hail brave friend say to the king the knowledge of the broil as thou didst leave it the worthy thane of ross my liege they are not yet come back but i have spoke with one that saw him die who did report that very frankly he confessed his treasons implored your highness' pardon and set forth a deep repentance nothing in his life became him like the leaving it he died as one that had been studied in his death to throw away the dearest thing he owed as 'twere a careless trifle o by whom why do we hold our tongues that most may claim this argument for ours nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion so all well contented what will you do let's not consort with them to show an unfelt sorrow is an office which the false man does easy i'll to england this murderous shaft that's shot hath not yet lighted and our safest way is to avoid the aim therefore to horse and let us not be dainty of leave taking but shift away there's warrant in that theft which steals itself when there's no mercy left let us seek out some desolate shade and there weep our sad bosoms empty what i believe i'll wail what know believe and what i can redress as i shall find the time to friend i will what you have spoke it may be so perchance this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues was once thought honest you have loved him well he hath not touched you yet i am young but something you may deserve of him through me and wisdom to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb t' appease an angry god but macbeth is a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge but i shall crave your pardon that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose angels are bright still though the brightest fell though all things foul would wear the brows of grace yet grace must still look so perchance even there where i did find my doubts why in that rawness left you wife and child those precious motives those strong knots of love without leave taking i pray you let not my jealousies be your dishonors but mine own safeties you may be rightly just whatever i shall think be not offended i speak not as in absolute fear of you i think our country sinks beneath the yoke it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash is added to her wounds i think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right and here from gracious england have i offer of goodly thousands but for all this when i shall tread upon the tyrant's head or wear it on my sword yet my poor country shall have more vices than it had before more suffer and more sundry ways than ever by him that shall succeed it is myself i mean in whom i know all the particulars of vice so grafted that when they shall be opened black macbeth will seem as pure as snow and the poor state esteem him as a lamb being compared with my confineless harms i grant him bloody luxurious avaricious false deceitful sudden malicious smacking of every sin that has a name but there's no bottom none in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters your matrons and your maids could not fill up the cistern of my lust and my desire all continent impediments would o'erbear that did oppose my will better macbeth than such an one to reign with this there grows in my most ill composed affection such a stanchless avarice that were i king i should cut off the nobles for their lands desire his jewels and this other's house and my more having would be as a sauce to make me hunger more that i should forge quarrels unjust against the good and loyal destroying them for wealth but i have none the king becoming graces as justice verity temp'rance stableness bounty perseverance mercy lowliness devotion patience courage fortitude i have no relish of them but abound in the division of each several crime acting it many ways nay had i power i should pour the sweet milk of concord into hell uproar the universal peace confound all unity on earth if such a one be fit to govern speak i am as i have spoken macduff this noble passion child of integrity hath from my soul wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts to thy good truth and honor devilish macbeth by many of these trains hath sought to win me into his power and modest wisdom plucks me from overcredulous haste but god above deal between thee and me for even now i put myself to thy direction and unspeak mine own detraction here abjure the taints and blames i laid upon myself for strangers to my nature i am yet unknown to woman never was forsworn scarcely have coveted what was mine own at no time broke my faith would not betray the devil to his fellow and delight no less in truth than life my first false speaking was this upon myself what i am truly is thine and my poor country's to command  whither indeed before thy here approach old siward with ten thousand warlike men already at a point was setting forth now we'll together and the chance of goodness be like our warranted quarrel why are you silent well more anon  comes the king forth i pray you i thank you doctor 'tis called the evil a most miraculous work in this good king which often since my here remain in england i have seen him do how he solicits heaven himself best knows but strangely visited people all swoll'n and ulcerous pitiful to the eye the mere despair of surgery he cures hanging a golden stamp about their necks put on with holy prayers and 'tis spoken to the succeeding royalty he leaves the healing benediction with this strange virtue he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy and sundry blessings hang about his throne that speak him full of grace my countryman but yet i know him not i know him now good god betimes remove the means that makes us strangers what's the newest grief be 't their comfort we are coming thither gracious england hath lent us good siward and ten thousand men an older and a better soldier none that christendom gives out merciful heaven  what man ne'er pull your hat upon your brows give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break be comforted let's make us med'cines of our great revenge to cure this deadly grief dispute it like a man be this the whetstone of your sword let grief convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it this tune goes manly come go we to the king our power is ready our lack is nothing but our leave macbeth is ripe for shaking and the powers above put on their instruments receive what cheer you may the night is long that never finds the day cousins i hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe let every soldier hew him down a bough and bear 't before him thereby shall we shadow the numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us 'tis his main hope for where there is advantage to be given both more and less have given him the revolt and none serve with him but constrain√®d things whose hearts are absent too now near enough your leafy screens throw down and show like those you are you worthy uncle shall with my cousin your right noble son lead our first battle worthy macduff and we shall take upon 's what else remains to do according to our order we have met with foes that strike beside us i would the friends we miss were safe arrived macduff is missing and your noble son he's worth more sorrow and that i'll spend for him we shall not spend a large expense of time before we reckon with your several loves and make us even with you my thanes and kinsmen henceforth be earls the first that ever scotland in such an honor named what's more to do which would be planted newly with the time as calling home our exiled friends abroad that fled the snares of watchful tyranny producing forth the cruel ministers of this dead butcher and his fiend like queen who as 'tis thought by self and violent hands took off her life this and what needful else that calls upon us by the grace of grace we will perform in measure time and place so thanks to all at once and to each one whom we invite to see us crowned at scone
