you have her father's love demetrius let me have hermia's do you marry him i am my lord as well derived as he as well possessed my love is more than his my fortunes every way as fairly ranked if not with vantage as demetrius' and which is more than all these boasts can be i am beloved of beauteous hermia why should not i then prosecute my right demetrius i'll avouch it to his head made love to nedar's daughter helena and won her soul and she sweet lady dotes devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry upon this spotted and inconstant man how now my love why is your cheek so pale how chance the roses there do fade so fast ay me for aught that i could ever read could ever hear by tale or history the course of true love never did run smooth but either it was different in blood  or else misgraffèd in respect of years  or else it stood upon the choice of friends  or if there were a sympathy in choice war death or sickness did lay siege to it making it momentany as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dream brief as the lightning in the collied night that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth and ere a man hath power to say behold the jaws of darkness do devour it up so quick bright things come to confusion a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia i have a widow aunt a dowager of great revenue and she hath no child from athens is her house remote seven leagues and she respects me as her only son there gentle hermia may i marry thee and to that place the sharp athenian law cannot pursue us if thou lovest me then steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night and in the wood a league without the town where i did meet thee once with helena to do observance to a morn of may there will i stay for thee keep promise love look here comes helena helen to you our minds we will unfold tomorrow night when phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the wat'ry glass decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass a time that lovers' flights doth still conceal through athens' gates have we devised to steal i will my hermia helena adieu as you on him demetrius dote on you fair love you faint with wand'ring in the wood and to speak troth i have forgot our way we'll rest us hermia if you think it good and tarry for the comfort of the day one turf shall serve as pillow for us both one heart one bed two bosoms and one troth o take the sense sweet of my innocence love takes the meaning in love's conference i mean that my heart unto yours is knit so that but one heart we can make of it two bosoms interchainèd with an oath  so then two bosoms and a single troth then by your side no bed room me deny for lying so hermia i do not lie amen amen to that fair prayer say i and then end life when i end loyalty here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake transparent helena nature shows art that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart where is demetrius o how fit a word is that vile name to perish on my sword content with hermia no i do repent the tedious minutes i with her have spent not hermia but helena i love who will not change a raven for a dove the will of man is by his reason swayed and reason says you are the worthier maid things growing are not ripe until their season so i being young till now ripe not to reason and touching now the point of human skill reason becomes the marshal to my will and leads me to your eyes where i o'erlook love's stories written in love's richest book she sees not hermia hermia sleep thou there and never mayst thou come lysander near for as a surfeit of the sweetest things the deepest loathing to the stomach brings or as the heresies that men do leave are hated most of those they did deceive so thou my surfeit and my heresy of all be hated but the most of me and all my powers address your love and might to honor helen and to be her knight why should you think that i should woo in scorn scorn and derision never come in tears look when i vow i weep and vows so born in their nativity all truth appears how can these things in me seem scorn to you bearing the badge of faith to prove them true i had no judgment when to her i swore demetrius loves her and he loves not you you are unkind demetrius be not so for you love hermia this you know i know and here with all goodwill with all my heart in hermia's love i yield you up my part and yours of helena to me bequeath whom i do love and will do till my death helen it is not so why should he stay whom love doth press to go lysander's love that would not let him bide fair helena who more engilds the night than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light why seek'st thou me could not this make thee know the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so stay gentle helena hear my excuse my love my life my soul fair helena thou canst compel no more than she entreat thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers  helen i love thee by my life i do i swear by that which i will lose for thee to prove him false that says i love thee not if thou say so withdraw and prove it too away you ethiop hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose or i will shake thee from me like a serpent thy love out tawny tartar out out loathèd med'cine o hated potion hence demetrius i will keep my word with thee what should i hurt her strike her kill her dead although i hate her i'll not harm her so ay by my life and never did desire to see thee more therefore be out of hope of question of doubt be certain nothing truer 'tis no jest that i do hate thee and love helena be not afraid she shall not harm thee helena get you gone you dwarf you minimus of hind'ring knotgrass made you bead you acorn  now she holds me not now follow if thou dar'st to try whose right of thine or mine is most in helena where art thou proud demetrius speak thou now i will be with thee straight he goes before me and still dares me on when i come where he calls then he is gone the villain is much lighter heeled than i i followed fast but faster he did fly that fallen am i in dark uneven way and here will rest me come thou gentle day for if but once thou show me thy gray light i'll find demetrius and revenge this spite pardon my lord my lord i shall reply amazèdly half sleep half waking but as yet i swear i cannot truly say how i came here but as i think for truly would i speak and now i do bethink me so it is i came with hermia hither our intent was to be gone from athens where we might without the peril of the athenian law  and he did bid us follow to the temple more than to us wait in your royal walks your board your bed he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop a good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true this lion is a very fox for his valor proceed moon and so the lion vanished less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
