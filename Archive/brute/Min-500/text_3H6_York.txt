uncles you are come to sandal in a happy hour the army of the queen mean to besiege us what with five thousand men five men to twenty though the odds be great i doubt not uncle of our victory many a battle have i won in france whenas the enemy hath been ten to one why should i not now have the like success the army of the queen hath got the field my uncles both are slain in rescuing me and all my followers to the eager foe turn back and fly like ships before the wind or lambs pursued by hunger starvèd wolves my sons god knows what hath bechancèd them but this i know they have demeaned themselves like men borne to renown by life or death three times did richard make a lane to me and thrice cried courage father fight it out and full as oft came edward to my side with purple falchion painted to the hilt in blood of those that had encountered him and when the hardiest warriors did retire richard cried charge and give no foot of ground and cried a crown or else a glorious tomb a scepter or an earthly sepulcher with this we charged again but out alas we budged again as i have seen a swan with bootless labor swim against the tide and spend her strength with over matching waves ah hark the fatal followers do pursue and i am faint and cannot fly their fury and were i strong i would not shun their fury the sands are numbered that makes up my life here must i stay and here my life must end come bloody clifford rough northumberland i dare your quenchless fury to more rage i am your butt and i abide your shot my ashes as the phoenix' may bring forth a bird that will revenge upon you all and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven scorning whate'er you can afflict me with why come you not what multitudes and fear o clifford but bethink thee once again and in thy thought o'errun my former time and if thou canst for blushing view this face and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this so triumph thieves upon their conquered booty so true men yield with robbers so o'ermatched she wolf of france but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth how ill beseeming is it in thy sex to triumph like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates but that thy face is vizard like unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay proud queen to make thee blush to tell thee whence thou cam'st of whom derived were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death 'tis beauty that doth oft make women proud but god he knows thy share thereof is small 'tis virtue that doth make them most admired the contrary doth make thee wondered at 'tis government that makes them seem divine the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion o tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide how couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a woman's face women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless bidd'st thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins these tears are my sweet rutland's obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death 'gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoman that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touched would not have stained with blood but you are more inhuman more inexorable o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania see ruthless queen a hapless father's tears this cloth thou dipped'st in blood of my sweet boy and i with tears do wash the blood away keep thou the napkin and go boast of this and if thou tell'st the heavy story right upon my soul the hearers will shed tears yea even my foes will shed fast falling tears and say alas it was a piteous deed there take the crown and with the crown my curse and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand  hard hearted clifford take me from the world my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads open thy gate of mercy gracious god my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee
