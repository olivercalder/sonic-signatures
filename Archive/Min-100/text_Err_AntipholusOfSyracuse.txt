buildings and then return and sleep within mine inn for with long travel i am stiff and weary get thee away a trusty villain sir that very oft when i am dull with care and melancholy lightens my humor with his merry jests what will you walk with me about the town and then go to my inn and dine with me farewell till then i will go lose myself and wander up and down to view the city he that commends me to mine own content commends me to the thing i cannot get i to the world am like a drop of water that in the ocean seeks another drop who falling there to find his fellow forth unseen inquisitive confounds himself so i to find a mother and a brother in quest of them unhappy lose myself here comes the almanac of my true date  what now how chance thou art returned so soon stop in your wind sir tell me this i pray where have you left the money that i gave you i am not in a sportive humor now tell me and dally not where is the money we being strangers here how dar'st thou trust so great a charge from thine own custody come dromio come these jests are out of season reserve them till a merrier hour than this where is the gold i gave in charge to thee come on sir knave have done your foolishness and tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge now as i am a christian answer me in what safe place you have bestowed my money or i shall break that merry sconce of yours that stands on tricks when i am undisposed where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me thy mistress' marks what mistress slave hast thou what wilt thou flout me thus unto my face being forbid there take you that sir knave upon my life by some device or other the villain is o'erraught of all my money they say this town is full of cozenage as nimble jugglers that deceive the eye dark working sorcerers that change the mind soul killing witches that deform the body disguisèd cheaters prating mountebanks and many suchlike liberties of sin if it prove so i will be gone the sooner i'll to the centaur to go seek this slave i greatly fear my money is not safe the gold i gave to dromio is laid up safe at the centaur and the heedful slave is wandered forth in care to seek me out by computation and mine host's report i could not speak with dromio since at first i sent him from the mart see here he comes how now sir is your merry humor altered as you love strokes so jest with me again you know no centaur you received no gold your mistress sent to have me home to dinner my house was at the phoenix wast thou mad that thus so madly thou didst answer me even now even here not half an hour since villain thou didst deny the gold's receipt and told'st me of a mistress and a dinner for which i hope thou felt'st i was displeased yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth think'st thou i jest hold take thou that and that because that i familiarly sometimes do use you for my fool and chat with you your sauciness will jest upon my love and make a common of my serious hours when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport but creep in crannies when he hides his beams if you will jest with me know my aspect and fashion your demeanor to my looks or i will beat this method in your sconce dost thou not know shall i tell you why why first for flouting me and then wherefore for urging it the second time to me thank me sir for what i'll make you amends next to give you nothing for something but say sir is it dinnertime in good time sir what's that well sir then 'twill be dry your reason well sir learn to jest in good time there's a time for all things by what rule sir let's hear it may he not do it by fine and recovery why is time such a niggard of hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement why but there's many a man hath more hair than wit why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit for what reason nay not sound i pray you nay not sure in a thing falsing name them you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things but your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover i knew 'twould be a bald conclusion but soft who wafts us yonder plead you to me fair dame i know you not in ephesus i am but two hours old as strange unto your town as to your talk who every word by all my wit being scanned wants wit in all one word to understand by dromio did you converse sir with this gentlewoman what is the course and drift of your compact villain thou liest for even her very words didst thou deliver to me on the mart how can she thus then call us by our names  unless it be by inspiration to me she speaks she moves me for her theme what was i married to her in my dream or sleep i now and think i hear all this what error drives our eyes and ears amiss until i know this sure uncertainty i'll entertain the offered fallacy i think thou art in mind and so am i thou hast thine own form am i in earth in heaven or in hell sleeping or waking mad or well advised known unto these and to myself disguised i'll say as they say and persever so and in this mist at all adventures go sweet mistress what your name is else i know not nor by what wonder you do hit of mine  less in your knowledge and your grace you show not than our earth's wonder more than earth divine teach me dear creature how to think and speak lay open to my earthy gross conceit smothered in errors feeble shallow weak the folded meaning of your words' deceit against my soul's pure truth why labor you to make it wander in an unknown field are you a god would you create me new transform me then and to your power i'll yield but if that i am i then well i know your weeping sister is no wife of mine nor to her bed no homage do i owe far more far more to you do i decline o train me not sweet mermaid with thy note to drown me in thy sister's flood of tears sing siren for thyself and i will dote spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs and as a bed i'll take them and there lie and in that glorious supposition think he gains by death that hath such means to die let love being light be drownèd if she sink not mad but mated how i do not know for gazing on your beams fair sun being by as good to wink sweet love as look on night thy sister's sister no it is thyself mine own self's better part mine eye's clear eye my dear heart's dearer heart my food my fortune and my sweet hope's aim my sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim call thyself sister sweet for i am thee thee will i love and with thee lead my life thou hast no husband yet nor i no wife give me thy hand why how now dromio where runn'st thou so fast thou art dromio thou art my man thou art thyself what woman's man and how besides thyself what claim lays she to thee what is she how dost thou mean a fat marriage what complexion is she of that's a fault that water will mend what's her name then she bears some breadth in what part of her body stands ireland where scotland where france where england where spain where america the indies where stood belgia the netherlands go hie thee presently post to the road an if the wind blow any way from shore i will not harbor in this town tonight if any bark put forth come to the mart where i will walk till thou return to me if everyone knows us and we know none 'tis time i think to trudge pack and be gone there's none but witches do inhabit here and therefore 'tis high time that i were hence she that doth call me husband even my soul doth for a wife abhor but her fair sister possessed with such a gentle sovereign grace of such enchanting presence and discourse hath almost made me traitor to myself but lest myself be guilty to self wrong i'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song ay that's my name what is your will that i shall do with this made it for me sir i bespoke it not i pray you sir receive the money now for fear you ne'er see chain nor money more what i should think of this i cannot tell but this i think there's no man is so vain that would refuse so fair an offered chain i see a man here needs not live by shifts when in the streets he meets such golden gifts i'll to the mart and there for dromio stay if any ship put out then straight away there's not a man i meet but doth salute me as if i were their well acquainted friend and everyone doth call me by my name some tender money to me some invite me some other give me thanks for kindnesses some offer me commodities to buy even now a tailor called me in his shop and showed me silks that he had bought for me and therewithal took measure of my body sure these are but imaginary wiles and lapland sorcerers inhabit here what gold is this what adam dost thou mean i understand thee not what thou mean'st an officer well sir there rest in your foolery is there any ships puts forth tonight may we be gone the fellow is distract and so am i and here we wander in illusions some blessèd power deliver us from hence satan avoid i charge thee tempt me not it is the devil why dromio avoid then fiend what tell'st thou me of supping thou art as you are all a sorceress i conjure thee to leave me and be gone avaunt thou witch come dromio let us go i see these witches are afraid of swords come to the centaur fetch our stuff from thence i long that we were safe and sound aboard i will not stay tonight for all the town therefore away to get our stuff aboard i think i had i never did deny it who heard me to deny it or forswear it thou art a villain to impeach me thus i'll prove mine honor and mine honesty against thee presently if thou dar'st stand egeon art thou not or else his ghost no sir not i i came from syracuse i gentle mistress and so do i yet did she call me so and this fair gentlewoman her sister here did call me brother what i told you then i hope i shall have leisure to make good if this be not a dream i see and hear i think it be sir i deny it not this purse of ducats i received from you and dromio my man did bring them me i see we still did meet each other's man and i was ta'en for him and he for me and thereupon these errors are arose he speaks to me i am your master dromio come go with us we'll look to that anon embrace thy brother there rejoice with him
