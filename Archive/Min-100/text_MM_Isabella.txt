and have you nuns no farther privileges yes truly i speak not as desiring more but rather wishing a more strict restraint upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare who's that which calls peace and prosperity who is 't that calls why her unhappy brother let me ask the rather for i now must make you know i am that isabella and his sister woe me for what sir make me not your story you do blaspheme the good in mocking me someone with child by him my cousin juliet adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names by vain though apt affection o let him marry her doth he so seek his life alas what poor ability's in me to do him good my power alas i doubt  i'll see what i can do i will about it straight no longer staying but to give the mother notice of my affair i humbly thank you commend me to my brother soon at night i'll send him certain word of my success good sir adieu i am a woeful suitor to your honor please but your honor hear me there is a vice that most i do abhor and most desire should meet the blow of justice for which i would not plead but that i must for which i must not plead but that i am at war 'twixt will and will not i have a brother is condemned to die i do beseech you let it be his fault and not my brother o just but severe law i had a brother then heaven keep your honor must he needs die yes i do think that you might pardon him and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy but can you if you would but might you do 't and do the world no wrong if so your heart were touched with that remorse as mine is to him too late why no i that do speak a word may call it back again well believe this no ceremony that to great ones longs not the king's crown nor the deputed sword the marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does if he had been as you and you as he you would have slipped like him but he like you would not have been so stern i would to heaven i had your potency and you were isabel should it then be thus no i would tell what 'twere to be a judge and what a prisoner alas alas why all the souls that were were forfeit once and he that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy how would you be if he which is the top of judgment should but judge you as you are o think on that and mercy then will breathe within your lips like man new made tomorrow o that's sudden spare him spare him he's not prepared for death even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you who is it that hath died for this offense there's many have committed it yet show some pity so you must be the first that gives this sentence and he that suffers o it is excellent to have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would never be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder merciful heaven thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt splits the unwedgeable and gnarlèd oak than the soft myrtle but man proud man dressed in a little brief authority most ignorant of what he's most assured his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as makes the angels weep who with our spleens would all themselves laugh mortal we cannot weigh our brother with ourself great men may jest with saints 'tis wit in them but in the less foul profanation that in the captain's but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy because authority though it err like others hath yet a kind of medicine in itself that skins the vice o' th' top go to your bosom knock there and ask your heart what it doth know that's like my brother's fault if it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his let it not sound a thought upon your tongue against my brother's life gentle my lord turn back hark how i'll bribe you good my lord turn back ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you not with fond sicles of the tested gold or stones whose rate are either rich or poor as fancy values them but with true prayers that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere sunrise prayers from preservèd souls from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal heaven keep your honor safe at what hour tomorrow shall i attend your lordship save your honor i am come to know your pleasure even so heaven keep your honor under your sentence when i beseech you that in his reprieve longer or shorter he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not 'tis set down so in heaven but not in earth sir believe this i had rather give my body than my soul how say you please you to do 't i'll take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all but charity that i do beg his life if it be sin heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit if that be sin i'll make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine and nothing of your answer let me be ignorant and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better so true as much for my poor brother as myself that is were i under the terms of death th' impression of keen whips i'd wear as rubies and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for ere i'd yield my body up to shame and 'twere the cheaper way better it were a brother died at once than that a sister by redeeming him should die forever ignomy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption o pardon me my lord it oft falls out to have what we would have we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love else let my brother die if not a fedary but only he owe and succeed thy weakness ay as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make forms women help heaven men their creation mar in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexions are and credulous to false prints i have no tongue but one gentle my lord let me entreat you speak the former language my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for 't i know your virtue hath a license in 't which seems a little fouler than it is to pluck on others ha little honor to be much believed and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming i will proclaim thee angelo look for 't sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretched throat i'll tell the world aloud what man thou art to whom should i complain did i tell this who would believe me o perilous mouths that bear in them one and the selfsame tongue either of condemnation or approof bidding the law make curtsy to their will hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite to follow as it draws i'll to my brother though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood yet hath he in him such a mind of honor that had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks he'd yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorred pollution then isabel live chaste and brother die more than our brother is our chastity i'll tell him yet of angelo's request and fit his mind to death for his soul's rest what ho peace here grace and good company my business is a word or two with claudio why as all comforts are most good most good indeed lord angelo having affairs to heaven intends you for his swift ambassador where you shall be an everlasting leiger therefore your best appointment make with speed tomorrow you set on none but such remedy as to save a head to cleave a heart in twain yes brother you may live there is a devilish mercy in the judge if you'll implore it that will free your life but fetter you till death ay just perpetual durance a restraint though all the world's vastidity you had to a determined scope in such a one as you consenting to 't would bark your honor from that trunk you bear and leave you naked o i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honor dar'st thou die the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies there spake my brother there my father's grave did utter forth a voice yes thou must die thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances this outward sainted deputy  whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i' th' head and follies doth enew as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil his filth within being cast he would appear a pond as deep as hell o 'tis the cunning livery of hell the damned'st body to invest and cover in prenzie guards dost thou think claudio if i would yield him my virginity thou mightst be freed yes he would give 't thee from this rank offense so to offend him still this night's the time that i should do what i abhor to name or else thou diest tomorrow o were it but my life i'd throw it down for your deliverance as frankly as a pin be ready claudio for your death tomorrow which is the least what says my brother and shamèd life a hateful alas alas o you beast o faithless coward o dishonest wretch wilt thou be made a man out of my vice is 't not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sister's shame what should i think heaven shield my mother played my father fair for such a warpèd slip of wilderness ne'er issued from his blood take my defiance die perish might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed i'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death no word to save thee o fie fie fie thy sin's not accidental but a trade mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd 'tis best that thou diest quickly what is your will i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile i am now going to resolve him i had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born but o how much is the good duke deceived in angelo if ever he return and i can speak to him i will open my lips in vain or discover his government let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name can this be so did angelo so leave her what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world what corruption in this life that it will let this man live but how out of this can she avail show me how good father the image of it gives me content already and i trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection i thank you for this comfort fare you well good father he hath a garden circummured with brick whose western side is with a vineyard backed and to that vineyard is a planchèd gate that makes his opening with this bigger key this other doth command a little door which from the vineyard to the garden leads there have i made my promise upon the heavy middle of the night to call upon him i have ta'en a due and wary note upon 't with whispering and most guilty diligence in action all of precept he did show me the way twice o'er no none but only a repair i' th' dark and that i have possessed him my most stay can be but brief for i have made him know i have a servant comes with me along that stays upon me whose persuasion is i come about my brother i do desire the like she'll take the enterprise upon her father if you advise it little have you to say when you depart from him but soft and low remember now my brother peace ho be here ho by your leave the better given me by so holy a man hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon nay but it is not so o i will to him and pluck out his eyes unhappy claudio wretched isabel injurious world most damnèd angelo i am directed by you to speak so indirectly i am loath i would say the truth but to accuse him so that is your part yet i am advised to do it he says to veil full purpose besides he tells me that if peradventure he speak against me on the adverse side i should not think it strange for 'tis a physic that's bitter to sweet end o peace the friar is come justice o royal duke vail your regard upon a wronged i would fain have said a maid o worthy prince dishonor not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and given me justice justice justice justice o worthy duke you bid me seek redemption of the devil hear me yourself for that which i must speak must either punish me not being believed or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here by course of justice most strange but yet most truly will i speak that angelo's forsworn is it not strange that angelo's a murderer is 't not strange that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite a virgin violator is it not strange and strange it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange nay it is ten times true for truth is truth to th' end of reck'ning o prince i conjure thee as thou believest there is another comfort than this world that thou neglect me not with that opinion that i am touched with madness make not impossible that which but seems unlike 'tis not impossible but one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute as angelo even so may angelo in all his dressings caracts titles forms be an archvillain believe it royal prince if he be less he's nothing but he's more had i more name for badness o gracious duke harp not on that nor do not banish reason for inequality but let your reason serve to make the truth appear where it seems hid and hide the false seems true i am the sister of one claudio condemned upon the act of fornication to lose his head condemned by angelo i in probation of a sisterhood was sent to by my brother one lucio as then the messenger  that's he indeed this gentleman told somewhat of my tale i went to this pernicious caitiff deputy  pardon it the phrase is to the matter in brief to set the needless process by how i persuaded how i prayed and kneeled how he refelled me and how i replied  for this was of much length the vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter he would not but by gift of my chaste body to his concupiscible intemperate lust release my brother and after much debatement my sisterly remorse confutes mine honor and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant for my poor brother's head o that it were as like as it is true and is this all then o you blessèd ministers above keep me in patience and with ripened time unfold the evil which is here wrapped up in countenance heaven shield your grace from woe as i thus wronged hence unbelievèd go one that i would were here friar lodowick o give me pardon that i your vassal have employed and pained your unknown sovereignty i do my lord most bounteous sir look if it please you on this man condemned as if my brother lived i partly think a due sincerity governed his deeds till he did look on me since it is so let him not die my brother had but justice in that he did the thing for which he died for angelo his act did not o'ertake his bad intent and must be buried but as an intent that perished by the way thoughts are no subjects intents but merely thoughts
