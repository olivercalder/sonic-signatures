as true as i believe you think them false that give you cause to prove my saying true what other harm have i good lady done but spoke the harm that is by others done pardon me madam i may not go without you to the kings therefore to be possessed with double pomp to guard a title that was rich before to gild refinèd gold to paint the lily to throw a perfume on the violet to smooth the ice or add another hue unto the rainbow or with taper light to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish is wasteful and ridiculous excess in this the antique and well noted face of plain old form is much disfigurèd and like a shifted wind unto a sail it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about startles and frights consideration makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected for putting on so new a fashioned robe to this effect before you were new crowned we breathed our counsel but it pleased your highness to overbear it and we are all well pleased since all and every part of what we would doth make a stand at what your highness will the color of the king doth come and go between his purpose and his conscience like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set his passion is so ripe it needs must break indeed we feared his sickness was past cure it is apparent foul play and 'tis shame that greatness should so grossly offer it so thrive it in your game and so farewell lords i will meet him at saint edmundsbury it is our safety and we must embrace this gentle offer of the perilous time the count melun a noble lord of france whose private with me of the dauphin's love is much more general than these lines import or rather then set forward for 'twill be two long days' journey lords or ere we meet the king hath dispossessed himself of us we will not line his thin bestainèd cloak with our pure honors nor attend the foot that leaves the print of blood where'er it walks return and tell him so we know the worst our griefs and not our manners reason now this is the prison what is he lies here murder as hating what himself hath done doth lay it open to urge on revenge sir richard what think you you have beheld or have you read or heard or could you think or do you almost think although you see that you do see could thought without this object form such another this is the very top the height the crest or crest unto the crest of murder's arms this is the bloodiest shame the wildest savagery the vilest stroke that ever wall eyed wrath or staring rage presented to the tears of soft remorse if that it be the work of any hand we had a kind of light what would ensue it is the shameful work of hubert's hand the practice and the purpose of the king from whose obedience i forbid my soul kneeling before this ruin of sweet life and breathing to his breathless excellence the incense of a vow a holy vow never to taste the pleasures of the world never to be infected with delight nor conversant with ease and idleness till i have set a glory to this hand by giving it the worship of revenge o he is bold and blushes not at death  avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone must i rob the law not till i sheathe it in a murderer's skin thou art a murderer stand by or i shall gall you faulconbridge trust not those cunning waters of his eyes for villainy is not without such rheum and he long traded in it makes it seem like rivers of remorse and innocency away with me all you whose souls abhor th' uncleanly savors of a slaughterhouse for i am stifled with this smell of sin upon our sides it never shall be broken and noble dauphin albeit we swear a voluntary zeal and unurged faith to your proceedings yet believe me prince i am not glad that such a sore of time should seek a plaster by contemned revolt and heal the inveterate canker of one wound by making many o it grieves my soul that i must draw this metal from my side to be a widow maker o and there where honorable rescue and defense cries out upon the name of salisbury but such is the infection of the time that for the health and physic of our right we cannot deal but with the very hand of stern injustice and confusèd wrong and is 't not pity o my grievèd friends that we the sons and children of this isle was born to see so sad an hour as this wherein we step after a stranger march upon her gentle bosom and fill up her enemies' ranks i must withdraw and weep upon the spot of this enforcèd cause to grace the gentry of a land remote and follow unacquainted colors here what here o nation that thou couldst remove that neptune's arms who clippeth thee about would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself and grapple thee unto a pagan shore where these two christian armies might combine the blood of malice in a vein of league and not to spend it so unneighborly i did not think the king so stored with friends that misbegotten devil faulconbridge in spite of spite alone upholds the day when we were happy we had other names wounded to death may this be possible may this be true we do believe thee and beshrew my soul but i do love the favor and the form of this most fair occasion by the which we will untread the steps of damnèd flight and like a bated and retirèd flood leaving our rankness and irregular course stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlooked and calmly run on in obedience even to our ocean to our great king john my arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence for i do see the cruel pangs of death right in thine eye away my friends new flight and happy newness that intends old right be of good comfort prince for you are born to set a form upon that indigest which he hath left so shapeless and so rude you breathe these dead news in as dead an ear  my liege my lord but now a king now thus it seems you know not then so much as we the cardinal pandulph is within at rest who half an hour since came from the dauphin and brings from him such offers of our peace as we with honor and respect may take with purpose presently to leave this war nay 'tis in a manner done already for many carriages he hath dispatched to the sea side and put his cause and quarrel to the disposing of the cardinal with whom yourself myself and other lords if you think meet this afternoon will post to consummate this business happily and the like tender of our love we make to rest without a spot forevermore
