before angiers well met brave austria  arthur that great forerunner of thy blood richard that robbed the lion of his heart and fought the holy wars in palestine by this brave duke came early to his grave and for amends to his posterity at our importance hither is he come to spread his colors boy in thy behalf and to rebuke the usurpation of thy unnatural uncle english john embrace him love him give him welcome hither a noble boy who would not do thee right women and fools break off your conference  king john this is the very sum of all england and ireland anjou touraine maine in right of arthur do i claim of thee wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms i do my lord and in her eye i find a wonder or a wondrous miracle the shadow of myself formed in her eye which being but the shadow of your son becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow i do protest i never loved myself till now infixèd i beheld myself drawn in the flattering table of her eye nay ask me if i can refrain from love for i do love her most unfeignedly she is sad and passionate at your highness' tent bethink you father for the difference is purchase of a heavy curse from rome or the light loss of england for a friend forgo the easier father to arms i muse your majesty doth seem so cold when such profound respects do pull you on lady with me with me thy fortune lies what he hath won that hath he fortified so hot a speed with such advice disposed such temperate order in so fierce a cause doth want example who hath read or heard of any kindred action like to this there's nothing in this world can make me joy life is as tedious as a twice told tale vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man and bitter shame hath spoiled the sweet world's taste that it yields naught but shame and bitterness all days of glory joy and happiness as heartily as he is glad he hath him but what shall i gain by young arthur's fall and lose it life and all as arthur did maybe he will not touch young arthur's life but hold himself safe in his prisonment strong reasons makes strange actions let us go if you say ay the king will not say no my lord melun let this be copied out and keep it safe for our remembrance return the precedent to these lords again that having our fair order written down both they and we perusing o'er these notes may know wherefore we took the sacrament and keep our faiths firm and inviolable a noble temper dost thou show in this and great affections wrestling in thy bosom doth make an earthquake of nobility o what a noble combat hast thou fought between compulsion and a brave respect let me wipe off this honorable dew that silverly doth progress on thy cheeks my heart hath melted at a lady's tears being an ordinary inundation but this effusion of such manly drops this shower blown up by tempest of the soul startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed than had i seen the vaulty top of heaven figured quite o'er with burning meteors lift up thy brow renownèd salisbury and with a great heart heave away this storm commend these waters to those baby eyes that never saw the giant world enraged nor met with fortune other than at feasts full warm of blood of mirth of gossiping come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep into the purse of rich prosperity as louis himself so nobles shall you all that knit your sinews to the strength of mine and even there methinks an angel spake look where the holy legate comes apace to give us warrant from the hand of god and on our actions set the name of right with holy breath your grace shall pardon me i will not back i am too high born to be propertied to be a secondary at control or useful servingman and instrument to any sovereign state throughout the world your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars between this chastised kingdom and myself and brought in matter that should feed this fire and now 'tis far too huge to be blown out with that same weak wind which enkindled it you taught me how to know the face of right acquainted me with interest to this land yea thrust this enterprise into my heart and come you now to tell me john hath made his peace with rome what is that peace to me i by the honor of my marriage bed after young arthur claim this land for mine and now it is half conquered must i back because that john hath made his peace with rome am i rome's slave what penny hath rome borne what men provided what munition sent to underprop this action is 't not i that undergo this charge who else but i and such as to my claim are liable sweat in this business and maintain this war have i not heard these islanders shout out vive le roi as i have banked their towns have i not here the best cards for the game to win this easy match played for a crown and shall i now give o'er the yielded set no no on my soul it never shall be said outside or inside i will not return till my attempt so much be glorified as to my ample hope was promisèd before i drew this gallant head of war and culled these fiery spirits from the world to outlook conquest and to win renown even in the jaws of danger and of death what lusty trumpet thus doth summon us there end thy brave and turn thy face in peace we grant thou canst outscold us fare thee well we hold our time too precious to be spent with such a brabbler we will attend to neither strike up the drums and let the tongue of war plead for our interest and our being here strike up our drums to find this danger out the sun of heaven methought was loath to set but stayed and made the western welkin blush when english measured backward their own ground in faint retire o bravely came we off when with a volley of our needless shot after such bloody toil we bid good night and wound our tott'ring colors clearly up last in the field and almost lords of it here what news ah foul shrewd news beshrew thy very heart i did not think to be so sad tonight as this hath made me who was he that said king john did fly an hour or two before the stumbling night did part our weary powers well keep good quarter and good care tonight the day shall not be up so soon as i to try the fair adventure of tomorrow
