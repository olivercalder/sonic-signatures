reignier is 't thou that thinkest to beguile me where is the dauphin come come from behind i know thee well though never seen before be not amazed there's nothing hid from me in private will i talk with thee apart  stand back you lords and give us leave a while dauphin i am by birth a shepherd's daughter my wit untrained in any kind of art heaven and our lady gracious hath it pleased to shine on my contemptible estate lo whilst i waited on my tender lambs and to sun's parching heat displayed my cheeks god's mother deignèd to appear to me and in a vision full of majesty willed me to leave my base vocation and free my country from calamity her aid she promised and assured success in complete glory she revealed herself and whereas i was black and swart before with those clear rays which she infused on me that beauty am i blest with which you may see ask me what question thou canst possible and i will answer unpremeditated my courage try by combat if thou dar'st and thou shalt find that i exceed my sex resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate if thou receive me for thy warlike mate i am prepared here is my keen edged sword decked with fine flower de luces on each side  the which at touraine in saint katherine's churchyard out of a great deal of old iron i chose forth and while i live i'll ne'er fly from a man christ's mother helps me else i were too weak i must not yield to any rights of love for my profession's sacred from above when i have chasèd all thy foes from hence then will i think upon a recompense why no i say distrustful recreants fight till the last gasp i'll be your guard assigned am i to be the english scourge this night the siege assuredly i'll raise expect saint martin's summer halcyons' days since i have enterèd into these wars glory is like a circle in the water which never ceaseth to enlarge itself till by broad spreading it disperse to naught with henry's death the english circle ends dispersèd are the glories it included now am i like that proud insulting ship which caesar and his fortune bare at once come come 'tis only i that must disgrace thee talbot farewell thy hour is not yet come i must go victual orleance forthwith o'ertake me if thou canst i scorn thy strength go go cheer up thy hunger starvèd men help salisbury to make his testament this day is ours as many more shall be advance our waving colors on the walls rescued is orleance from the english thus joan la pucelle hath performed her word wherefore is charles impatient with his friend at all times will you have my power alike sleeping or waking must i still prevail or will you blame and lay the fault on me  improvident soldiers had your watch been good this sudden mischief never could have fall'n question my lords no further of the case how or which way 'tis sure they found some place but weakly guarded where the breach was made and now there rests no other shift but this to gather our soldiers scattered and dispersed and lay new platforms to endamage them these are the city gates the gates of roan through which our policy must make a breach take heed be wary how you place your words talk like the vulgar sort of market men that come to gather money for their corn if we have entrance as i hope we shall and that we find the slothful watch but weak i'll by a sign give notice to our friends that charles the dauphin may encounter them paysans la pauvre gens de france poor market folks that come to sell their corn now roan i'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground behold this is the happy wedding torch that joineth roan unto her countrymen but burning fatal to the talbonites good morrow gallants want you corn for bread i think the duke of burgundy will fast before he'll buy again at such a rate 'twas full of darnel do you like the taste what will you do good graybeard break a lance and run a tilt at death within a chair are you so hot sir yet pucelle hold thy peace if talbot do but thunder rain will follow god speed the parliament who shall be the speaker belike your lordship takes us then for fools to try if that our own be ours or no away captains let's get us from the walls for talbot means no goodness by his looks  goodbye my lord we came but to tell you that we are here dismay not princes at this accident nor grieve that roan is so recoverèd care is no cure but rather corrosive for things that are not to be remedied let frantic talbot triumph for a while and like a peacock sweep along his tail we'll pull his plumes and take away his train if dauphin and the rest will be but ruled then thus it must be this doth joan devise by fair persuasions mixed with sugared words we will entice the duke of burgundy to leave the talbot and to follow us your honors shall perceive how i will work to bring this matter to the wishèd end hark by the sound of drum you may perceive their powers are marching unto paris ward there goes the talbot with his colors spread and all the troops of english after him now in the rearward comes the duke and his fortune in favor makes him lag behind summon a parley we will talk with him the princely charles of france thy countryman brave burgundy undoubted hope of france stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee look on thy country look on fertile france and see the cities and the towns defaced by wasting ruin of the cruel foe as looks the mother on her lowly babe when death doth close his tender dying eyes see see the pining malady of france behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast o turn thy edgèd sword another way strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help one drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore return thee therefore with a flood of tears and wash away thy country's stainèd spots besides all french and france exclaims on thee doubting thy birth and lawful progeny who join'st thou with but with a lordly nation that will not trust thee but for profit's sake when talbot hath set footing once in france and fashioned thee that instrument of ill who then but english henry will be lord and thou be thrust out like a fugitive call we to mind and mark but this for proof was not the duke of orleance thy foe and was he not in england prisoner but when they heard he was thine enemy they set him free without his ransom paid in spite of burgundy and all his friends see then thou fight'st against thy countrymen and join'st with them will be thy slaughtermen come come return return thou wandering lord charles and the rest will take thee in their arms done like a frenchman turn and turn again once i encountered him and thus i said thou maiden youth be vanquished by a maid but with a proud majestical high scorn he answered thus young talbot was not born to be the pillage of a giglot wench so rushing in the bowels of the french he left me proudly as unworthy fight here's a silly stately style indeed the turk that two and fifty kingdoms hath writes not so tedious a style as this him that thou magnifi'st with all these titles stinking and flyblown lies here at our feet i think this upstart is old talbot's ghost he speaks with such a proud commanding spirit for god's sake let him have him to keep them here they would but stink and putrefy the air peace be amongst them if they turn to us else ruin combat with their palaces of all base passions fear is most accursed command the conquest charles it shall be thine let henry fret and all the world repine the regent conquers and the frenchmen fly now help you charming spells and periapts and you choice spirits that admonish me and give me signs of future accidents you speedy helpers that are substitutes under the lordly monarch of the north appear and aid me in this enterprise this speed and quick appearance argues proof of your accustomed diligence to me now you familiar spirits that are culled out of the powerful regions under earth help me this once that france may get the field o hold me not with silence overlong where i was wont to feed you with my blood i'll lop a member off and give it you in earnest of a further benefit so you do condescend to help me now no hope to have redress my body shall pay recompense if you will grant my suit cannot my body nor blood sacrifice entreat you to your wonted furtherance then take my soul my body soul and all  before that england give the french the foil see they forsake me now the time is come that france must vail her lofty plumèd crest and let her head fall into england's lap my ancient incantations are too weak and hell too strong for me to buckle with now france thy glory droopeth to the dust changed to a worser shape thou canst not be a plaguing mischief light on charles and thee and may you both be suddenly surprised by bloody hands in sleeping on your beds i prithee give me leave to curse awhile decrepit miser base ignoble wretch i am descended of a gentler blood thou art no father nor no friend of mine peasant avaunt you have suborned this man of purpose to obscure my noble birth first let me tell you whom you have condemned not one begotten of a shepherd swain but issued from the progeny of kings virtuous and holy chosen from above by inspiration of celestial grace to work exceeding miracles on earth i never had to do with wicked spirits but you that are polluted with your lusts stained with the guiltless blood of innocents corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices because you want the grace that others have you judge it straight a thing impossible to compass wonders but by help of devils no misconceivèd joan of arc hath been a virgin from her tender infancy chaste and immaculate in very thought whose maiden blood thus rigorously effused will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts then joan discover thine infirmity that warranteth by law to be thy privilege i am with child you bloody homicides murder not then the fruit within my womb although you hale me to a violent death you are deceived my child is none of his it was alanson that enjoyed my love o give me leave i have deluded you 'twas neither charles nor yet the duke i named but reignier king of naples that prevailed then lead me hence with whom i leave my curse may never glorious sun reflex his beams upon the country where you make abode but darkness and the gloomy shade of death environ you till mischief and despair drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves
