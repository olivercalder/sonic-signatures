underhand means labored to dissuade him from it but he is resolute i'll tell thee charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of france full of ambition an envious emulator of every man's good parts a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother therefore use thy discretion i had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger and thou wert best look to 't for if thou dost him any

know him that i am altogether misprized but it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that i kindle the boy thither which now i'll go about o that your highness knew my heart in this i never loved my brother in my life good morrow fair ones pray you if you know where in the purlieus of this forest stands a sheepcote fenced about with olive trees if that an eye may profit by a tongue then should i know you by description  such garments and such years the boy is fair of female favor and bestows himself like a ripe sister the woman low and browner than her brother are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for orlando doth commend him to you both and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin are you he some of my shame if you will know of me what man i am and how and why and where this handkercher was stained when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour and pacing through the forest chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell he threw his eye aside  and mark what object did present itself under an old oak whose boughs were mossed with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself who with her head nimble in threats approached the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlinked itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bush's shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for 'tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural twice did he turn his back and purposed so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awaked 'twas i but 'tis not i i do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am by and by when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bathed  as how i came into that desert place  in brief he led me to the gentle duke who gave me fresh array and entertainment committing me unto my brother's love who led me instantly unto his cave there stripped himself and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away which all this while had bled and now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind brief i recovered him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind many will swoon when they do look on blood look he recovers be of good cheer youth you a man you lack a man's heart this was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man that will i for i must bear answer back how you excuse my brother rosalind neither call the giddiness of it in question the poverty of her the small acquaintance my sudden wooing nor her sudden consenting but say with me i love aliena say with her that she loves me consent with both that we may enjoy each other it shall be to your good for my father's house and all the revenue that was old sir rowland's will i estate upon you and here live and die a shepherd and you fair sister
