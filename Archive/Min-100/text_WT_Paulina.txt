seem yours i say i come from your good queen good queen my lord good queen i say good queen and would by combat make her good so were i a man the worst about you let him that makes but trifles of his eyes first hand me on mine own accord i'll off but first i'll do my errand the good queen for she is good hath brought you forth a daughter  here 'tis commends it to your blessing not so i am as ignorant in that as you in so entitling me and no less honest than you are mad which is enough i'll warrant as this world goes to pass for honest forever unvenerable be thy hands if thou tak'st up the princess by that forced baseness which he has put upon 't so i would you did then 'twere past all doubt you'd call your children yours nor i nor any but one that's here and that's himself for he the sacred honor of himself his queen's his hopeful son's his babe's betrays to slander whose sting is sharper than the sword's and will not  for as the case now stands it is a curse he cannot be compelled to 't once remove the root of his opinion which is rotten as ever oak or stone was sound it is yours and might we lay th' old proverb to your charge so like you 'tis the worse behold my lords although the print be little the whole matter and copy of the father eye nose lip the trick of 's frown his forehead nay the valley the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek his smiles the very mold and frame of hand nail finger and thou good goddess nature which hast made it so like to him that got it if thou hast the ordering of the mind too 'mongst all colors no yellow in 't lest she suspect as he does her children not her husband's a most unworthy and unnatural lord can do no more i care not it is an heretic that makes the fire not she which burns in 't i'll not call you tyrant but this most cruel usage of your queen not able to produce more accusation than your own weak hinged fancy something savors of tyranny and will ignoble make you yea scandalous to the world i pray you do not push me i'll be gone  look to your babe my lord 'tis yours jove send her a better guiding spirit what needs these hands you that are thus so tender o'er his follies will never do him good not one of you so so farewell we are gone this news is mortal to the queen look down and see what death is doing woe the while o cut my lace lest my heart cracking it break too what studied torments tyrant hast for me what wheels racks fires what flaying boiling in leads or oils what old or newer torture must i receive whose every word deserves to taste of thy most worst thy tyranny together working with thy jealousies fancies too weak for boys too green and idle for girls of nine o think what they have done and then run mad indeed stark mad for all thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it that thou betrayedst polixenes 'twas nothing that did but show thee of a fool inconstant and damnable ingrateful nor was 't much thou wouldst have poisoned good camillo's honor to have him kill a king poor trespasses more monstrous standing by whereof i reckon the casting forth to crows thy baby daughter to be or none or little though a devil would have shed water out of fire ere done 't nor is 't directly laid to thee the death of the young prince whose honorable thoughts thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart that could conceive a gross and foolish sire blemished his gracious dam this is not no laid to thy answer but the last o lords when i have said cry woe the queen the queen the sweet'st dear'st creature's dead and vengeance for 't not dropped down yet i say she's dead i'll swear 't if word nor oath prevail not go and see if you can bring tincture or luster in her lip her eye heat outwardly or breath within i'll serve you as i would do the gods but o thou tyrant do not repent these things for they are heavier than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee to nothing but despair a thousand knees ten thousand years together naked fasting upon a barren mountain and still winter in storm perpetual could not move the gods to look that way thou wert i am sorry for 't all faults i make when i shall come to know them i do repent alas i have showed too much the rashness of a woman he is touched to th' noble heart what's gone and what's past help should be past grief do not receive affliction at my petition i beseech you rather let me be punished that have minded you of what you should forget now good my liege sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman the love i bore your queen lo fool again  i'll speak of her no more nor of your children i'll not remember you of my own lord who is lost too take your patience to you and i'll say nothing true too true my lord if one by one you wedded all the world or from the all that are took something good to make a perfect woman she you killed would be unparalleled you are one of those would have him wed again there is none worthy respecting her that's gone besides the gods will have fulfilled their secret purposes for has not the divine apollo said is 't not the tenor of his oracle that king leontes shall not have an heir till his lost child be found which that it shall is all as monstrous to our human reason as my antigonus to break his grave and come again to me who on my life did perish with the infant 'tis your counsel my lord should to the heavens be contrary oppose against their wills care not for issue the crown will find an heir great alexander left his to th' worthiest so his successor was like to be the best and left them more rich for what they yielded had she such power she had just cause i should so were i the ghost that walked i'd bid you mark her eye and tell me for what dull part in 't you chose her then i'd shriek that even your ears should rift to hear me and the words that followed should be remember mine will you swear never to marry but by my free leave then good my lords bear witness to his oath unless another as like hermione as is her picture affront his eye i have done yet if my lord will marry if you will sir no remedy but you will give me the office to choose you a queen she shall not be so young as was your former but she shall be such as walked your first queen's ghost it should take joy to see her in your arms that shall be when your first queen's again in breath never till then o hermione as every present time doth boast itself above a better gone so must thy grave give way to what's seen now sir you yourself have said and writ so but your writing now is colder than that theme she had not been nor was not to be equalled thus your verse flowed with her beauty once 'tis shrewdly ebbed to say you have seen a better how not women had our prince jewel of children seen this hour he had paired well with this lord there was not full a month between their births sir my liege your eye hath too much youth in 't not a month 'fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes than what you look on now what sovereign sir i did not well i meant well all my services you have paid home but that you have vouchsafed with your crowned brother and these your contracted heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit it is a surplus of your grace which never my life may last to answer as she lived peerless so her dead likeness i do well believe excels whatever yet you looked upon or hand of man hath done therefore i keep it lonely apart but here it is prepare to see the life as lively mocked as ever still sleep mocked death behold and say 'tis well i like your silence it the more shows off your wonder but yet speak first you my liege comes it not something near so much the more our carver's excellence which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her as she lived now o patience the statue is but newly fixed the color's not dry indeed my lord if i had thought the sight of my poor image would thus have wrought you for the stone is mine  i'd not have showed it no longer shall you gaze on 't lest your fancy may think anon it moves i'll draw the curtain my lord's almost so far transported that he'll think anon it lives i am sorry sir i have thus far stirred you but i could afflict you farther good my lord forbear the ruddiness upon her lip is wet you'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own with oily painting shall i draw the curtain either forbear quit presently the chapel or resolve you for more amazement if you can behold it i'll make the statue move indeed descend and take you by the hand but then you'll think  which i protest against i am assisted by wicked powers it is required you do awake your faith then all stand still  or those that think it is unlawful business i am about let them depart music awake her strike 'tis time descend be stone no more approach strike all that look upon with marvel come i'll fill your grave up stir nay come away bequeath to death your numbness for from him dear life redeems you you perceive she stirs start not her actions shall be holy as you hear my spell is lawful do not shun her until you see her die again for then you kill her double nay present your hand when she was young you wooed her now in age is she become the suitor that she is living were it but told you should be hooted at like an old tale but it appears she lives though yet she speak not mark a little while please you to interpose fair madam kneel and pray your mother's blessing turn good lady our perdita is found there's time enough for that lest they desire upon this push to trouble your joys with like relation go together you precious winners all your exultation partake to everyone i an old turtle will wing me to some withered bough and there my mate that's never to be found again lament till i am lost
