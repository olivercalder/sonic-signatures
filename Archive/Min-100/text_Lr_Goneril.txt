obedience scanted and well are worth the want that you have wanted sister it is not little i have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both i think our father will hence tonight you see how full of changes his age is the observation we have made of it hath not been little he always loved our sister most and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long engraffed condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them there is further compliment of leave taking between france and him pray you let us sit together if our father carry authority with such disposition as he bears this last surrender of his will but offend us we must do something and i' th' heat did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool by day and night he wrongs me every hour he flashes into one gross crime or other that sets us all at odds i'll not endure it his knights grow riotous and himself upbraids us on every trifle when he returns from hunting i will not speak with him say i am sick if you come slack of former services you shall do well the fault of it i'll answer put on what weary negligence you please you and your fellows i'd have it come to question if he distaste it let him to my sister whose mind and mine i know in that are one not to be overruled idle old man that still would manage those authorities that he hath given away now by my life old fools are babes again and must

too late have spoke and done that you protect this course and put it on by your allowance which if you should the fault would not 'scape censure nor the redresses sleep which in the tender of a wholesome weal might in their working do you that offense which else were shame that then necessity will call discreet proceeding i would you would make use of your good wisdom whereof i know you are

she begs a little to disquantity your train and the remainders that shall still depend to be such men as may besort your age which know themselves and you you strike my people and your disordered rabble make servants of their betters never afflict yourself to know more of it but let his disposition have that scope as dotage gives it do you mark that pray you content what oswald ho  you sir
