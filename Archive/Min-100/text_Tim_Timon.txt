flatter'st misery why dost thou seek me out always a villain's office or a fool's dost please thyself in 't what a knave too not by his breath that is more miserable thou art a slave whom fortune's tender arm with favor never clasped but bred a dog hadst thou like us from our first swathe proceeded the sweet degrees that this brief world affords to such as may the passive drugs of it freely command thou wouldst have plunged thyself in general riot melted down thy youth in different beds of lust and never learned the icy precepts of respect but followed the sugared game before thee but myself  who had the world as my confectionary the mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men at duty more than i could frame employment that numberless upon me stuck as leaves do on the oak have with one winter's brush fell from their boughs and left me open bare for every storm that blows i to bear this that never knew but better is some burden thy nature did commence in sufferance time hath made thee hard in 't why shouldst thou hate men they never flattered thee what hast thou given if thou wilt curse thy father that poor rag must be thy subject who in spite put stuff to some she beggar and compounded thee poor rogue hereditary hence begone if thou hadst not been born the worst of men thou hadst been a knave and flatterer ay that i am not thee i that i am one now were all the wealth i have shut up in thee i'd give thee leave to hang it get thee gone that the whole life of athens were in this thus would i eat it first mend my company take away thyself 'tis not well mended so it is but botched if not i would it were thee thither in a whirlwind if thou wilt tell them there i have gold look so i have the best and truest for here it sleeps and does no hired harm under that's above me where feed'st thou a days apemantus would poison were obedient and knew my mind to sauce thy dishes on what i hate i feed not ay though it look like thee who without those means thou talk'st of didst thou ever know beloved i understand thee thou hadst some means to keep a dog women nearest but men men are the things themselves what wouldst thou do with the world apemantus if it lay in thy power wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men and remain a beast with the beasts a beastly ambition which the gods grant thee t' attain to if thou wert the lion the fox would beguile thee if thou wert the lamb the fox would eat thee if thou wert the fox the lion would suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass if thou wert the ass thy dullness would torment thee and still thou lived'st but as a breakfast to the wolf if thou wert the wolf thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner wert thou the unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury wert thou a bear thou wouldst be killed by the horse wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seized by the leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert germane to the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life all thy safety were remotion and thy defense absence what beast couldst thou be that were not subject to a beast and what a beast art thou already that seest not thy loss in transformation how has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city when there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be welcome i had rather be a beggar's dog than apemantus would thou wert clean enough to spit upon all villains that do stand by thee are pure if i name thee i'll beat thee but i should infect my hands away thou issue of a mangy dog choler does kill me that thou art alive i swoon to see thee away thou tedious rogue i am sorry i shall lose a stone by thee slave rogue rogue rogue i am sick of this false world and will love nought but even the mere necessities upon 't then timon presently prepare thy grave lie where the light foam of the sea may beat thy gravestone daily make thine epitaph that death in me at others' lives may laugh o thou sweet king killer and dear divorce 'twixt natural son and sire thou bright defiler of hymen's purest bed thou valiant mars thou ever young fresh loved and delicate wooer whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow that lies on dian's lap thou visible god that sold'rest close impossibilities and mak'st them kiss that speak'st with every tongue to every purpose o thou touch of hearts think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue set them into confounding odds that beasts may have the world in empire thronged to thy back i prithee long live so and so die i am quit now thieves both too and women's sons your greatest want is you want much of meat why should you want behold the earth hath roots within this mile break forth a hundred springs the oaks bear mast the briars scarlet hips the bounteous huswife nature on each bush lays her full mess before you want why want nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes you must eat men yet thanks i must you con that you are thieves professed that you work not in holier shapes for there is boundless theft in limited professions rascal thieves here's gold go suck the subtle blood o' th' grape till the high fever seethe your blood to froth and so 'scape hanging trust not the physician his antidotes are poison and he slays more than you rob take wealth and lives together do villainy do since you protest to do 't like workmen i'll example you with thievery the sun's a thief and with his great attraction robs the vast sea the moon's an arrant thief and her pale fire she snatches from the sun the sea's a thief whose liquid surge resolves the moon into salt tears the earth's a thief that feeds and breeds by a composture stol'n from gen'ral excrement each thing's a thief the laws your curb and whip in their rough power has unchecked theft love not yourselves away rob one another there's more goldcut throats all that you meet are thieves to athens go break open shops nothing can you steal but thieves do lose it steal less for this i give you and gold confound you howsoe'er amen away what art thou why dost ask that i have forgot all men then if thou grant'st thou 'rt a man i have forgot thee then i know thee not i never had honest man about me i all i kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains what dost thou weep come nearer then i love thee because thou art a woman and disclaim'st flinty mankind whose eyes do never give but thorough lust and laughter pity's sleeping strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping had i a steward so true so just and now so comfortable it almost turns my dangerous nature mild let me behold thy face surely this man was born of woman forgive my general and exceptless rashness you perpetual sober gods i do proclaim one honest man mistake me not but one no more i pray and he's a steward how fain would i have hated all mankind and thou redeem'st thyself but all save thee i fell with curses methinks thou art more honest now than wise for by oppressing and betraying me thou mightst have sooner got another service for many so arrive at second masters upon their first lord's neck but tell me true  for i must ever doubt though ne'er so sure  is not thy kindness subtle covetous a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts expecting in return twenty for one look thee 'tis so thou singly honest man here take the gods out of my misery has sent thee treasure go live rich and happy but thus conditioned thou shalt build from men hate all curse all show charity to none but let the famished flesh slide from the bone ere thou relieve the beggar give to dogs what thou deniest to men let prisons swallow 'em debts wither 'em to nothing be men like blasted woods and may diseases lick up their false bloods and so farewell and thrive if thou hat'st curses stay not fly whilst thou art blest and free ne'er see thou man and let me ne'er see thee excellent workman thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men do so i have gold for thee i'll meet you at the turn what a god's gold that he is worshiped in a baser temple than where swine feed 'tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plow'st the foam settlest admirèd reverence in a slave to thee be worship and thy saints for aye be crowned with plagues that thee alone obey fit i meet them have i once lived to see two honest men let it go naked men may see 't the better you that are honest by being what you are make them best seen and known ay you are honest men most honest men why how shall i requite you can you eat roots and drink cold water no you're honest men you've heard that i have gold i am sure you have speak truth you're honest men good honest men thou draw'st a counterfeit best in all athens thou 'rt indeed the best thou counterfeit'st most lively e'en so sir as i say and for thy fiction why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth that thou art even natural in thine art but for all this my honest natured friends i must needs say you have a little fault marry 'tis not monstrous in you neither wish i you take much pains to mend you'll take it ill will you indeed there's never a one of you but trusts a knave that mightily deceives you ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble know his gross patchery love him feed him keep in your bosom yet remain assured that he's a made up villain look you i love you well i'll give you gold rid me these villains from your companies hang them or stab them drown them in a draft confound them by some course and come to me i'll give you gold enough you that way and you this but two in company each man apart all single and alone yet an archvillain keeps him company if where thou art two villains shall not be come not near him if thou wouldst not reside but where one villain is then him abandon  hence pack there's gold you came for gold you slaves you have work for me there's payment hence you are an alchemist make gold of that out rascal dogs thou sun that comforts burn speak and be hanged for each true word a blister and each false be as a cauterizing to the root o' th' tongue consuming it with speaking of none but such as you and you of timon i thank them and would send them back the plague could i but catch it for them you witch me in it surprise me to the very brink of tears lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes and i'll beweep these comforts worthy senators well sir i will therefore i will sir thus if alcibiades kill my countrymen let alcibiades know this of timon  that timon cares not but if he sack fair athens and take our goodly agèd men by th' beards giving our holy virgins to the stain of contumelious beastly mad brained war then let him know and tell him timon speaks it in pity of our agèd and our youth i cannot choose but tell him that i care not and let him take 't at worst for their knives care not while you have throats to answer for myself there's not a whittle in th' unruly camp but i do prize it at my love before the reverend'st throat in athens so i leave you to the protection of the prosperous gods as thieves to keepers why i was writing of my epitaph it will be seen tomorrow my long sickness of health and living now begins to mend and nothing brings me all things go live still be alcibiades your plague you his and last so long enough but yet i love my country and am not one that rejoices in the common wrack as common bruit doth put it commend me to my loving countrymen commend me to them and tell them that to ease them of their griefs their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses their pangs of love with other incident throes that nature's fragile vessel doth sustain in life's uncertain voyage i will some kindness do them i'll teach them to prevent wild alcibiades' wrath i have a tree which grows here in my close that mine own use invites me to cut down and shortly must i fell it tell my friends tell athens in the sequence of degree from high to low throughout that whoso please to stop affliction let him take his haste come hither ere my tree hath felt the ax and hang himself i pray you do my greeting come not to me again but say to athens timon hath made his everlasting mansion upon the beachèd verge of the salt flood who once a day with his embossèd froth the turbulent surge shall cover thither come and let my gravestone be your oracle lips let four words go by and language end what is amiss plague and infection mend graves only be men's works and death their gain sun hide thy beams timon hath done his reign
