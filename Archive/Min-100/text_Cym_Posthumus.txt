that did e'er plight troth my residence in rome at one philario's who to my father was a friend to me known but by letter thither write my queen and with mine eyes i'll drink the words you send though ink be made of gall should we be taking leave as long a term as yet we have to live the loathness to depart would grow adieu how how another you gentle gods give me but this i have and cere up my embracements from a next with bonds of death remain remain thou here while sense can keep it on and sweetest fairest as i my poor self did exchange for you to your so infinite loss so in our trifles i still win of you for my sake wear this it is a manacle of love i'll place it upon this fairest prisoner alack the king the gods protect you and bless the good remainders of the court i am gone since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still by your pardon sir i was then a young traveler rather shunned to go even with what i heard than in my every action to be guided by others' experiences but upon my mended judgment  if i offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slight she holds her virtue still and i my mind being so far provoked as i was in france i would abate her nothing though i profess myself her adorer not her friend i praised her as i rated her so do i my stone more than the world enjoys you are mistaken the one may be sold or given or if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods which by their graces i will keep your italy contains none so accomplished a courtier to convince the honor of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail i do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding i fear not my ring sir with all my heart this worthy signior i thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first no no you are a great deal abused in too bold a persuasion and i doubt not you sustain what you're worthy of by your attempt a repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve more a punishment too what lady would you choose to assail i will wage against your gold gold to it my ring i hold dear as my finger 'tis part of it this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose i hope will you i shall but lend my diamond till your return let there be covenants drawn between 's my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking i dare you to this match here's my ring i embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevailed i am no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain unseduced you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and th' assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword agreed fear it not sir i would i were so sure to win the king as i am bold her honor will remain hers not any but abide the change of time quake in the present winter's state and wish that warmer days would come in these feared hopes i barely gratify your love they failing i must die much your debtor i do believe statist though i am none nor like to be that this will prove a war and you shall hear the legion now in gallia sooner landed in our not fearing britain than have tidings of any penny tribute paid our countrymen are men more ordered than when julius caesar smiled at their lack of skill but found their courage worthy his frowning at their discipline now wing√®d with their courages will make known to their approvers they are people such that mend upon the world the swiftest harts have posted you by land and winds of all the corners kissed your sails to make your vessel nimble i hope the briefness of your answer made the speediness of your return and therewithal the best or let her beauty look thorough a casement to allure false hearts and be false with them their tenor good i trust all is well yet sparkles this stone as it was wont or is 't not too dull for your good wearing the stone's too hard to come by make not sir your loss your sport i hope you know that we must not continue friends if you can make 't apparent that you have tasted her in bed my hand and ring is yours if not the foul opinion you had of her pure honor gains or loses your sword or mine or masterless leave both to who shall find them proceed this is true and this you might have heard of here by me or by some other so they must or do your honor injury this is a thing which you might from relation likewise reap being as it is much spoke of this is her honor let it be granted you have seen all this and praise be given to your remembrance the description of what is in her chamber nothing saves the wager you have laid jove once more let me behold it is it that which i left with her maybe she plucked it off to send it me o no no no 'tis true here take this too it is a basilisk unto mine eye kills me to look on 't let there be no honor where there is beauty truth where semblance love where there's another man the vows of women of no more bondage be to where they are made than they are to their virtues which is nothing o above measure false very true and so i hope he came by 't back my ring render to me some corporal sign about her more evident than this for this was stol'n hark you he swears by jupiter he swears 'tis true nay keep the ring 'tis true i am sure she would not lose it her attendants are all sworn and honorable they induced to steal it and by a stranger no he hath enjoyed her the cognizance of her incontinency is this she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly there take thy hire and all the fiends of hell divide themselves between you never talk on 't she hath been colted by him ay and it doth confirm another stain as big as hell can hold were there no more but it spare your arithmetic never count the turns once and a million no swearing if you will swear you have not done 't you lie and i will kill thee if thou dost deny thou 'st made me cuckold o that i had her here to tear her limb meal i will go there and do 't i' th' court before her father i'll do something is there no way for men to be but women must be half workers we are all bastards and that most venerable man which i did call my father was i know not where when i was stamped some coiner with his tools made me a counterfeit yet my mother seemed the dian of that time so doth my wife the nonpareil of this o vengeance vengeance me of my lawful pleasure she restrained and prayed me oft forbearance did it with a pudency so rosy the sweet view on 't might well have warmed old saturn that i thought her as chaste as unsunned snow o all the devils this yellow iachimo in an hour was 't not or less at first perchance he spoke not but like a full acorned boar a german one cried o and mounted found no opposition but what he looked for should oppose and she should from encounter guard could i find out the woman's part in me for there's no motion that tends to vice in man but i affirm it is the woman's part be it lying note it the woman's flattering hers deceiving hers lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers ambitions covetings change of prides disdain nice longing slanders mutability all faults that have a name nay that hell knows why hers in part or all but rather all for even to vice they are not constant but are changing still one vice but of a minute old for one not half so old as that i'll write against them detest them curse them yet 'tis greater skill in a true hate to pray they have their will the very devils cannot plague them better yea bloody cloth i'll keep thee for i wished thou shouldst be colored thus you married ones if each of you should take this course how many must murder wives much better than themselves for wrying but a little o pisanio every good servant does not all commands no bond but to do just ones gods if you should have ta'en vengeance on my faults i never had lived to put on this so had you saved the noble imogen to repent and struck me wretch more worth your vengeance but alack you snatch some hence for little faults that's love to have them fall no more you some permit to second ills with ills each elder worse and make them dread it to the doers' thrift but imogen is your own do your best wills and make me blest to obey i am brought hither among th' italian gentry and to fight against my lady's kingdom 'tis enough that britain i have killed thy mistress peace i'll give no wound to thee therefore good heavens hear patiently my purpose i'll disrobe me of these italian weeds and suit myself as does a briton peasant so i'll fight against the part i come with so i'll die for thee o imogen even for whom my life is every breath a death and thus unknown pitied nor hated to the face of peril myself i'll dedicate let me make men know more valor in me than my habits show gods put the strength o' th' leonati in me to shame the guise o' th' world i will begin the fashion less without and more within i did though you it seems come from the fliers no blame be to you sir for all was lost but that the heavens fought the king himself of his wings destitute the army broken and but the backs of britons seen all flying through a strait lane the enemy full hearted lolling the tongue with slaught'ring having work more plentiful than tools to do 't struck down some mortally some slightly touched some falling merely through fear that the strait pass was dammed with dead men hurt behind and cowards living to die with lengthened shame close by the battle ditched and walled with turf which gave advantage to an ancient soldier an honest one i warrant who deserved so long a breeding as his white beard came to in doing this for 's country athwart the lane he with two striplings lads more like to run the country base than to commit such slaughter with faces fit for masks or rather fairer than those for preservation cased or shame  made good the passage cried to those that fled our britain's harts die flying not our men to darkness fleet souls that fly backwards stand or we are romans and will give you that like beasts which you shun beastly and may save but to look back in frown stand stand these three three thousand confident in act as many  for three performers are the file when all the rest do nothing with this word stand stand accommodated by the place more charming with their own nobleness which could have turned a distaff to a lance gilded pale looks part shame part spirit renewed that some turned coward but by example o a sin in war damned in the first beginners gan to look the way that they did and to grin like lions upon the pikes o' th' hunters then began a stop i' th' chaser a retire anon a rout confusion thick forthwith they fly chickens the way which they stooped eagles slaves the strides they victors made and now our cowards like fragments in hard voyages became the life o' th' need having found the backdoor open of the unguarded hearts heavens how they wound some slain before some dying some their friends o'erborne i' th' former wave ten chased by one are now each one the slaughterman of twenty those that would die or ere resist are grown the mortal bugs o' th' field nay do not wonder at it you are made rather to wonder at the things you hear than to work any will you rhyme upon 't and vent it for a mock'ry here is one two boys an old man twice a boy a lane preserved the britons was the romans' bane 'lack to what end who dares not stand his foe i'll be his friend for if he'll do as he is made to do i know he'll quickly fly my friendship too you have put me into rhyme still going this is a lord o noble misery to be i' th' field and ask what news of me today how many would have given their honors to have saved their carcasses took heel to do 't and yet died too i in mine own woe charmed could not find death where i did hear him groan nor feel him where he struck being an ugly monster 'tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds sweet words or hath more ministers than we that draw his knives i' th' war well i will find him for being now a favorer to the briton no more a britoni have resumed again the part i came in fight i will no more but yield me to the veriest hind that shall once touch my shoulder great the slaughter is here made by th' roman great the answer be britons must take for me my ransom's death on either side i come to spend my breath which neither here i'll keep nor bear again but end it by some means for imogen a roman who had not now been drooping here if seconds had answered him most welcome bondage for thou art a way i think to liberty yet am i better than one that's sick o' th' gout since he had rather groan so in perpetuity than be cured by th' sure physician death who is the key t' unbar these locks my conscience thou art fettered more than my shanks and wrists you good gods give me the penitent instrument to pick that bolt then free forever is 't enough i am sorry so children temporal fathers do appease gods are more full of mercy must i repent i cannot do it better than in gyves desired more than constrained to satisfy if of my freedom 'tis the main part take no stricter render of me than my all i know you are more clement than vile men who of their broken debtors take a third a sixth a tenth letting them thrive again on their abatement that's not my desire for imogen's dear life take mine and though 'tis not so dear yet 'tis a life you coined it 'tween man and man they weigh not every stamp though light take pieces for the figure's sake you rather mine being yours and so great powers if you will take this audit take this life and cancel these cold bonds o imogen i'll speak to thee in silence sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot a father to me and thou hast created a mother and two brothers but o scorn gone they went hence so soon as they were born and so i am awake poor wretches that depend on greatness' favor dream as i have done wake and find nothing but alas i swerve many dream not to find neither deserve and yet are steeped in favors so am i that have this golden chance and know not why what fairies haunt this ground a book o rare one be not as is our fangled world a garment nobler than that it covers let thy effects so follow to be most unlike our courtiers as good as promise whenas a lion's whelp shall to himself unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches which being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty 'tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen tongue and brain not either both or nothing or senseless speaking or a speaking such as sense cannot untie be what it is the action of my life is like it which i'll keep if but for sympathy over roasted rather ready long ago so if i prove a good repast to the spectators the dish pays the shot i am merrier to die than thou art to live yes indeed do i fellow i tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to direct them the way i am going but such as wink and will not use them thou bring'st good news i am called to be made free thou shalt be then freer than a jailer no bolts for the dead what's that to him ay so thou dost italian fiend ay me most credulous fool egregious murderer thief anything that's due to all the villains past in being to come o give me cord or knife or poison some upright justicer thou king send out for torturers ingenious it is i that all th' abhorr√®d things o' th' earth amend by being worse than they i am posthumus that killed thy daughter villainlike i lie  that caused a lesser villain than myself a sacrilegious thief to do 't the temple of virtue was she yea and she herself spit and throw stones cast mire upon me set the dogs o' th' street to bay me every villain be called posthumus leonatus and be villainy less than 'twas o imogen my queen my life my wife o imogen imogen imogen shall 's have a play of this thou scornful page there lie thy part how comes these staggers on me hang there like fruit my soul till the tree die i am sir the soldier that did company these three in poor beseeming 'twas a fitment for the purpose i then followed that i was he speak iachimo i had you down and might have made you finish kneel not to me the power that i have on you is to spare you the malice towards you to forgive you live and deal with others better your servant princes good my lord of rome call forth your soothsayer as i slept methought great jupiter upon his eagle backed appeared to me with other spritely shows of mine own kindred when i waked i found this label on my bosom whose containing is so from sense in hardness that i can make no collection of it let him show his skill in the construction
