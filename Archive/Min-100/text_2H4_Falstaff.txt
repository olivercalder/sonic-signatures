sirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me the brain of this foolish compounded clay man is not able to invent anything that intends to laughter more than i invent or is invented on me i am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other men i do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one if the prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off why then i have no judgment thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels i was never manned with an agate till now but i will inset you neither in gold nor silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your master for a jewel the juvenal the prince your master whose chin is not yet fledge i will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face royal god may finish it when he will 'tis not a hair amiss yet he may keep it still at a face royal for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it and yet he'll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor he may keep his own grace but he's almost out of mine i can assure him what said master dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops let him be damned like the glutton pray god his tongue be hotter a whoreson achitophel a rascally yea forsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security the whoreson smoothy pates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is through with them in honest taking up then they must stand upon security i had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security i looked he should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin as i am a true knight and he sends me security well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and yet cannot he see though he have his own lantern to light him where's bardolph i bought him in paul's and he'll buy me a horse in smithfield an i could get me but a wife in the stews i were manned horsed and wived wait close i will not see him boy tell him i am deaf what a young knave and begging is there not wars is there not employment doth not the king lack subjects do not the rebels need soldiers though it be a shame to be on any side but one it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it why sir did i say you were an honest man setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside i had lied in my throat if i had said so i give thee leave to tell me so i lay aside that which grows to me if thou gett'st any leave of me hang me if thou tak'st leave thou wert better be hanged you hunt counter hence avaunt my good lord god give your lordship good time of the day i am glad to see your lordship abroad i heard

from much grief from study and perturbation of the brain i have read the cause of his effects in galen it is a kind of deafness very well my lord very well rather an 't please you it is the disease of not listening the malady of not marking that i am troubled withal i am as poor as job my lord but not so patient your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but how i should be your patient to follow your prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a scruple or indeed a scruple itself as i was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land

little regard in these costermongers' times that true valor is turned bearherd pregnancy is made a tapster and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings all the other gifts appurtenant to man as

and we that are in the vaward of our youth i must confess are wags too my lord i was born about three of the clock in the afternoon with a white head and something a round belly for my voice i have lost it with halloing and singing of anthems to approve my youth further i will not the truth is i am only old in judgment and understanding and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks let him lend me the money and have at him for the box of the ear that the prince gave you he gave it like a rude prince and you took it like a sensible lord i have checked him for it and the young lion

our english nation if they have a good thing to make it too common if you will needs say i am an old man you should give me rest i would to god my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is i were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth if i do fillip me with a three man beetle a man can no more separate age and covetousness than he can part young limbs and lechery but the gout galls the one and the pox pinches the other and so both the degrees prevent my curses boy

bardolph lead the men away as i return i will fetch off these justices i do see the bottom of justice shallow lord lord how subject we old men are to this vice of lying this same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about turnbull street and every third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the turk's tribute i do remember him at clement's inn like a man made after supper of a cheese paring when he was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife he was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible he was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores called him mandrake he came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle and swore they were his fancies or his good nights and now is this vice's dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of john o' gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and i'll be sworn he ne'er saw him but once in the tilt yard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal's men i saw it and told john o' gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel skin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court and now has he land and beefs well i'll be acquainted with him if i return and 't shall go hard but i'll make him a philosopher's two stones to me if the young dace be a bait for the old pike i see no reason in the law of nature but i may snap at him let time shape and there an end what's your name sir of what condition are you and of what place i pray well then colevile is your name a knight is your degree and your place the dale colevile shall be still your name a traitor your degree and the dungeon your place a place deep enough so shall you be still colevile of the dale as good a man as he sir whoe'er i am do you yield sir or shall i sweat for you if i do sweat they are the drops of thy lovers and they weep for thy death therefore rouse up fear and trembling and do observance to my mercy i have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name an i had but a belly of any indifferency i were simply the most active fellow in europe my womb my womb my womb undoes me here comes our general i would be sorry my lord but it should be thus i never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valor do you think me a swallow an arrow or a bullet have i in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought i have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility i have foundered ninescore and odd posts and here travel tainted as i am have in my pure and immaculate valor taken sir john colevile of the dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy but what of that he saw me and yielded that i may justly say with the hook nosed fellow of rome there cousin i came saw and overcame i know not here he is and here i yield him and i beseech your grace let it be booked with the rest of this day's deeds or by the lord i will have it in a particular ballad else with mine own picture on the top on 't colevile kissing my foot to the which course if i be enforced if you do not all show like gilt twopences to me and i in the clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element which show like pins' heads to her believe not the word of the noble therefore let me have right and let desert mount let it shine then let it do something my good lord that may do me good and call it what you will and a famous true subject took him i know not how they sold themselves but thou like a kind fellow gavest thyself away gratis and i thank thee for thee my lord i beseech you give me leave to go through gloucestershire and when you come to court stand my good lord pray in your good report i would you had but the wit 'twere better than your dukedom good faith this same young sober blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but that's no marvel he drinks no wine there's never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood and making many fish meals that they fall into a kind of male green sickness and then when they marry they get wenches they are generally fools and cowards which some of us should be too but for inflammation a good sherris sack hath a two fold operation in it it ascends me into the brain dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which delivered o'er to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit the second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts' extremes it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puffed up with this retinue doth any deed of courage and this valor comes of sherris so that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it a work and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use hereof comes it that prince harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant if i had a thousand sons the first human principle i would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack how now bardolph let them go i'll through gloucestershire and there will i visit master robert shallow esquire i have him already temp'ring between my finger and my thumb and shortly will i seal with him come away you must excuse me master robert shallow i'll follow you good master robert shallow bardolph look to our horses if i were sawed into quantities i should make four dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as master shallow it is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his they by observing of him do bear themselves like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned into a justice like servingman their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild geese if i had a suit to master shallow i would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master if to his men i would curry with master shallow that no man could better command his servants it is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed of their company i will devise matter enough out of this shallow to keep prince harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four terms or two actions and he shall laugh without intervallums o it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders o you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up i come master shallow i come master shallow fore god you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich this davy serves you for good uses he is your servingman and your husband there's a merry heart good master silence i'll give you a health for that anon i did not think master silence had been a man of this mettle well said master silence health and long life to you master silence why now you have done me right 'tis so from the court let him come in how now pistol what wind blew you hither pistol i pray thee now deliver them like a man of this world o base assyrian knight what is thy news let king cophetua know the truth thereof what is the old king dead away bardolph saddle my horse  master robert shallow choose what office thou wilt in the land 'tis thine pistol i will double charge thee with dignities carry master silence to bed master shallow my lord shallow be what thou wilt i am fortune's steward get on thy boots we'll ride all night o sweet pistol away bardolph come pistol utter more to me and withal devise something to do thyself good boot boot master shallow i know the young king is sick for me let us take any man's horses the laws of england are at my commandment blessed are they that have been my friends and woe to my lord chief justice stand here by me master robert shallow i will make the king do you grace i will leer upon him as he comes by and do but mark the countenance that he will give me come here pistol stand behind me o if i had had time to have made new liveries i would have bestowed the thousand pound i borrowed of you but 'tis no matter this poor show doth better this doth infer the zeal i had to see him it shows my earnestness of affection  my devotion  as it were to ride day and night and not to deliberate not to remember not to have patience to shift me  but to stand stained with travel and sweating with desire to see him thinking of nothing else putting all affairs else in oblivion as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him i will deliver her god save thy grace king hal my royal hal god save thee my sweet boy my king my jove i speak to thee my heart master shallow i owe you a thousand pound that can hardly be master shallow do not you grieve at this i shall be sent for in private to him look you he must seem thus to the world fear not your advancements i will be the man yet that shall make you great sir i will be as good as my word this that you heard was but a color fear no colors go with me to dinner  come lieutenant pistol come bardolph i shall be sent for soon at night my lord my lord
