a goodly day not to keep house with such whose roof's as low as ours stoop boys this gate instructs you how t' adore the heavens and bows you to a morning's holy office the gates of monarchs are arched so high that giants may jet through and keep their impious turbans on without good morrow to the sun hail thou fair heaven we house i' th' rock yet use thee not so hardly as prouder livers do now for our mountain sport up to yond hill your legs are young i'll tread these flats consider when you above perceive me like a crow that it is place which lessens and sets off and you may then revolve what tales i have told you of courts of princes of the tricks in war this service is not service so being done but being so allowed to apprehend thus draws us a profit from all things we see and often to our comfort shall we find the sharded beetle in a safer hold than is the full winged eagle o this life is nobler than attending for a check richer than doing nothing for a robe prouder than rustling in unpaid for silk such gain the cap of him that makes him fine yet keeps his book uncrossed no life to ours how you speak did you but know the city's usuries and felt them knowingly the art o' th' court as hard to leave as keep whose top to climb is certain falling or so slipp'ry that the fear's as bad as falling the toil o' th' war a pain that only seems to seek out danger i' th' name of fame and honor which dies i' th' search and hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph as record of fair act nay many times doth ill deserve by doing well what's worse must curtsy at the censure o boys this story the world may read in me my body's marked with roman swords and my report was once first with the best of note cymbeline loved me and when a soldier was the theme my name was not far off then was i as a tree whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night a storm or robbery call it what you will shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves and left me bare to weather my fault being nothing as i have told you oft but that two villains whose false oaths prevailed before my perfect honor swore to cymbeline i was confederate with the romans so followed my banishment and this twenty years this rock and these demesnes have been my world where i have lived at honest freedom paid more pious debts to heaven than in all the fore end of my time but up to th' mountains this is not hunters' language he that strikes the venison first shall be the lord o' th' feast to him the other two shall minister and we will fear no poison which attends in place of greater state i'll meet you in the valleys how hard it is to hide the sparks of nature these boys know little they are sons to th' king nor cymbeline dreams that they are alive they think they are mine and though trained up thus meanly i' th' cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hit the roofs of palaces and nature prompts them in simple and low things to prince it much beyond the trick of others this polydor the heir of cymbeline and britain who the king his father called guiderius jove when on my three foot stool i sit and tell the warlike feats i have done his spirits fly out into my story say thus mine enemy fell and thus i set my foot on 's neck even then the princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture that acts my words the younger brother cadwal once arviragus in as like a figure strikes life into my speech and shows much more his own conceiving hark the game is roused o cymbeline heaven and my conscience knows thou didst unjustly banish me whereon at three and two years old i stole these babes thinking to bar thee of succession as thou refts me of my lands euriphile thou wast their nurse they took thee for their mother and every day do honor to her grave myself belarius that am morgan called they take for natural father the game is up you polydor have proved best woodman and are master of the feast cadwal and i will play the cook and servant 'tis our match the sweat of industry would dry and die but for the end it works to come our stomachs will make what's homely savory weariness can snore upon the flint when resty sloth finds the down pillow hard now peace be here poor house that keep'st thyself stay come not in but that it eats our victuals i should think here were a fairy by jupiter an angel or if not an earthly paragon behold divineness no elder than a boy whither bound what's your name prithee fair youth think us no churls nor measure our good minds by this rude place we live in well encountered 'tis almost night you shall have better cheer ere you depart and thanks to stay and eat it  boys bid him welcome he wrings at some distress hark boys it shall be so boys we'll go dress our hunt fair youth come in discourse is heavy fasting when we have supped we'll mannerly demand thee of thy story so far as thou wilt speak it you are not well remain here in the cave we'll come to you after hunting what how how o noble strain o worthiness of nature breed of greatness cowards father cowards and base things sire base nature hath meal and bran contempt and grace i'm not their father yet who this should be doth miracle itself loved before me  'tis the ninth hour o' th' morn to th' field to th' field we'll leave you for this time go in and rest pray be not sick for you must be our huswife and shalt be ever this youth howe'er distressed appears he hath had good ancestors it is great morning come away who's there those runagates means he not us i partly know him 'tis cloten the son o' th' queen i fear some ambush i saw him not these many years and yet i know 'tis he we are held as outlaws hence no company's abroad i cannot tell long is it since i saw him but time hath nothing blurred those lines of favor which then he wore the snatches in his voice and burst of speaking were as his i am absolute 'twas very cloten being scarce made up i mean to man he had not apprehension of roaring terrors for defect of judgment is oft the cause of fear but see thy brother what hast thou done we are all undone no single soul can we set eye on but in all safe reason he must have some attendants though his humor was nothing but mutation ay and that from one bad thing to worse not frenzy not absolute madness could so far have raved to bring him here alone although perhaps it may be heard at court that such as we cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time may make some stronger head the which he hearing  as it is like him might break out and swear he'd fetch us in yet is 't not probable to come alone either he so undertaking or they so suffering then on good ground we fear if we do fear this body hath a tail more perilous than the head i had no mind to hunt this day the boy fidele's sickness did make my way long forth i fear 'twill be revenged would polydor thou hadst not done 't though valor becomes thee well enough well 'tis done we'll hunt no more today nor seek for danger where there's no profit i prithee to our rock you and fidele play the cooks i'll stay till hasty polydor return and bring him to dinner presently o thou goddess thou divine nature thou thyself thou blazon'st in these two princely boys they are as gentle as zephyrs blowing below the violet not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough their royal blood enchafed as the rud'st wind that by the top doth take the mountain pine and make him stoop to th' vale 'tis wonder that an invisible instinct should frame them to royalty unlearned honor untaught civility not seen from other valor that wildly grows in them but yields a crop as if it had been sowed yet still it's strange what cloten's being here to us portends or what his death will bring us my ingenious instrument hark polydor it sounds but what occasion hath cadwal now to give it motion hark he went hence even now look here he comes and brings the dire occasion in his arms of what we blame him for o melancholy whoever yet could sound thy bottom find the ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare might eas'liest harbor in thou bless√®d thing jove knows what man thou mightst have made but i thou died'st a most rare boy of melancholy  how found you him great griefs i see med'cine the less for cloten is quite forgot he was a queen's son boys and though he came our enemy remember he was paid for that though mean and mighty rotting together have one dust yet reverence that angel of the world doth make distinction of place 'tween high and low our foe was princely and though you took his life as being our foe yet bury him as a prince here's a few flowers but 'bout midnight more the herbs that have on them cold dew o' th' night are strewings fitt'st for graves upon their faces  you were as flowers now withered even so these herblets shall which we upon you strew  come on away apart upon our knees the ground that gave them first has them again their pleasures here are past so is their pain let us from it sons we'll higher to the mountains there secure us to the king's party there's no going newness of cloten's death we being not known not mustered among the bands may drive us to a render where we have lived and so extort from 's that which we have done whose answer would be death drawn on with torture o i am known of many in the army many years though cloten then but young you see not wore him from my remembrance and besides the king hath not deserved my service nor your loves who find in my exile the want of breeding the certainty of this hard life aye hopeless to have the courtesy your cradle promised but to be still hot summer's tanlings and the shrinking slaves of winter no reason i since of your lives you set so slight a valuation should reserve my cracked one to more care have with you boys if in your country wars you chance to die that is my bed too lads and there i'll lie lead lead the time seems long their blood thinks scorn till it fly out and show them princes born stand stand we have th' advantage of the ground the lane is guarded nothing routs us but the villainy of our fears i never saw such noble fury in so poor a thing such precious deeds in one that promised naught but beggary and poor looks sir in cambria are we born and gentlemen further to boast were neither true nor modest unless i add we are honest is not this boy revived from death peace peace see further he eyes us not forbear creatures may be alike were 't he i am sure he would have spoke to us be silent let's see further my boys there was our error though you did love this youth i blame you not you had a motive for 't stay sir king this man is better than the man he slew as well descended as thyself and hath more of thee merited than a band of clotens had ever scar for let his arms alone they were not born for bondage we will die all three but i will prove that two on 's are as good as i have given out him my sons i must for mine own part unfold a dangerous speech though haply well for you have at it then by leave thou hadst great king a subject who was called belarius he it is that hath assumed this age indeed a banished man i know not how a traitor not too hot first pay me for the nursing of thy sons and let it be confiscate all so soon as i have received it i am too blunt and saucy here's my knee ere i arise i will prefer my sons then spare not the old father mighty sir these two young gentlemen that call me father and think they are my sons are none of mine they are the issue of your loins my liege and blood of your begetting so sure as you your father's i old morgan am that belarius whom you sometime banished your pleasure was my mere offense my punishment itself and all my treason that i suffered was all the harm i did these gentle princes  for such and so they are these twenty years have i trained up those arts they have as i could put into them my breeding was sir as your highness knows their nurse euriphile whom for the theft i wedded stole these children upon my banishment i moved her to 't having received the punishment before for that which i did then beaten for loyalty excited me to treason their dear loss the more of you 'twas felt the more it shaped unto my end of stealing them but gracious sir here are your sons again and i must lose two of the sweet'st companions in the world the benediction of these covering heavens fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy to inlay heaven with stars be pleased awhile this gentleman whom i call polydor most worthy prince as yours is true guiderius this gentleman my cadwal arviragus your younger princely son he sir was lapped in a most curious mantle wrought by th' hand of his queen mother which for more probation i can with ease produce this is he who hath upon him still that natural stamp it was wise nature's end in the donation to be his evidence now
