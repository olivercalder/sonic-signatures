till i be gentle stay thou for thy good morrow  when thou art timon's dog and these knaves honest are they not athenians then i repent not thou know'st i do i called thee by thy name of nothing so much as that i am not like timon to knock out an honest athenian's brains right if doing nothing be death by th' law the best for the innocence he wrought better that made the painter and yet he's but a filthy piece of work thy mother's of my generation what's she if i be a dog no i eat not lords o they eat lords so they come by great bellies so thou apprehend'st it take it for thy labor not so well as plain dealing which will not cost a man a doit not worth my thinking how now poet thou liest yes art not a poet then thou liest look in thy last work where thou hast feigned him a worthy fellow yes he is worthy of thee and to pay thee for thy labor he that loves to be flattered is worthy o' th' flatterer heavens that i were a lord e'en as apemantus does now hate a lord with my heart ay that i had no angry wit to be a lord art not thou a merchant traffic confound thee if the gods will not traffic's thy god and thy god confound thee so so there aches contract and starve your supple joints that there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves and all this courtesy the strain of man's bred out into baboon and monkey time to be honest the most accursèd thou that still omit'st it ay to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice shouldst have kept one to thyself for i mean to give thee none no i will do nothing at thy bidding make thy requests to thy friend i will fly like a dog the heels o' th' ass ho ho confessed it hanged it have you not no you shall not make me welcome i come to have thee thrust me out of doors let me stay at thine apperil timon i come to observe i give thee warning on 't i scorn thy meat 'twould choke me for i should ne'er flatter thee o you gods what a number of men eats timon and he sees 'em not it grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood and all the madness is he cheers them up too i wonder men dare trust themselves with men methinks they should invite them without knives good for their meat and safer for their lives there's much example for 't the fellow that sits next him now parts bread with him pledges the breath of him in a divided draft is the readiest man to kill him 't 'as been proved if i were a huge man i should fear to drink at meals lest they should spy my wind pipe's dangerous notes great men should drink with harness on their throats flow this way a brave fellow he keeps his tides well those healths will make thee and thy state look ill timon here's that which is too weak to be a sinner honest water which ne'er left man i' th' mire this and my food are equals there's no odds feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods immortal gods i crave no pelf i pray for no man but myself grant i may never prove so fond to trust man on his oath or bond or a harlot for her weeping or a dog that seems a sleeping or a keeper with my freedom or my friends if i should need 'em amen so fall to 't rich men sin and i eat root much good dich thy good heart apemantus would all those flatterers were thine enemies then that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em thou weep'st to make them drink timon ho ho i laugh to think that babe a bastard much hoy day what a sweep of vanity comes this way they dance they are madwomen like madness is the glory of this life as this pomp shows to a little oil and root we make ourselves fools to disport ourselves and spend our flatteries to drink those men upon whose age we void it up again with poisonous spite and envy who lives that's not depravèd or depraves who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves of their friends' gift i should fear those that dance before me now would one day stamp upon me 't 'as been done men shut their doors against a setting sun faith for the worst is filthy and would not hold taking i doubt me what a coil's here serving of becks and jutting out of bums i doubt whether their legs be worth the sums that are given for 'em friendship's full of dregs methinks false hearts should never have sound legs thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies no i'll nothing for if i should be bribed too there would be none left to rail upon thee and then thou wouldst sin the faster thou giv'st so long timon i fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly what needs these feasts pomps and vainglories so thou wilt not hear me now thou shalt not then i'll lock thy heaven from thee o that men's ears should be to counsel deaf but not to flattery dost dialogue with thy shadow no 'tis to thyself come away no thou stand'st single thou 'rt not on him yet he last asked the question poor rogues and usurers' men bawds between gold and want asses that you ask me what you are and do not know yourselves speak to 'em fool good gramercy would i had a rod in my mouth that i might answer thee profitably canst not read there will little learning die then that day thou art hanged this is to lord timon this to alcibiades go thou wast born a bastard and thou 'lt die a bawd e'en so thou outrunn'st grace fool i will go with you to lord timon's if timon stay at home you three serve three usurers so would i as good a trick as ever hangman served thief do it then that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave which notwithstanding thou shalt be no less esteemed that answer might have become apemantus come with me fool come i was directed hither men report thou dost affect my manners and dost use them this is in thee a nature but infected a poor unmanly melancholy sprung from change of future why this spade this place this slavelike habit and these looks of care thy flatterers yet wear silk drink wine lie soft hug their diseased perfumes and have forgot that ever timon was shame not these woods by putting on the cunning of a carper be thou a flatterer now and seek to thrive by that which has undone thee hinge thy knee and let his very breath whom thou 'lt observe blow off thy cap praise his most vicious strain and call it excellent thou wast told thus thou gav'st thine ears like tapsters that bade welcome to knaves and all approachers 'tis most just that thou turn rascal had'st thou wealth again rascals should have 't do not assume my likeness thou hast cast away thyself being like thyself  a madman so long now a fool what think'st that the bleak air thy boisterous chamberlain will put thy shirt on warm will these moist trees that have outlived the eagle page thy heels and skip when thou point'st out will the cold brook candied with ice caudle thy morning taste to cure thy o'ernight's surfeit call the creatures whose naked natures live in all the spite of wreakful heaven whose bare unhousèd trunks to the conflicting elements exposed answer mere nature bid them flatter thee o thou shalt find  i love thee better now than e'er i did why i flatter not but say thou art a caitiff to vex thee ay if thou didst put this sour cold habit on to castigate thy pride 'twere well but thou dost it enforcedly thou 'dst courtier be again wert thou not beggar willing misery outlives incertain pomp is crowned before the one is filling still never complete the other at high wish best state contentless hath a distracted and most wretched being worse than the worst content thou shouldst desire to die being miserable art thou proud yet i that i was no prodigal here i will mend thy feast so i shall mend mine own by th' lack of thine what wouldst thou have to athens here is no use for gold where liest a nights timon where my stomach finds meat or rather where i eat it where wouldst thou send it the middle of humanity thou never knewest but the extremity of both ends when thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume they mocked thee for too much curiosity in thy rags thou know'st none but art despised for the contrary there's a medlar for thee eat it dost hate a medlar an thou 'dst hated meddlers sooner thou shouldst have loved thyself better now what man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means myself what things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers give it the beasts to be rid of the men ay timon if thou couldst please me with speaking to me thou mightst have hit upon it here the commonwealth of athens is become a forest of beasts yonder comes a poet and a painter the plague of company light upon thee i will fear to catch it and give way when i know not what else to do i'll see thee again thou art the cap of all the fools alive a plague on thee thou art too bad to curse there is no leprosy but what thou speak'st i would my tongue could rot them off would thou wouldst burst beast toad would 'twere so but not till i am dead i'll say thou 'st gold thou wilt be thronged to shortly ay live and love thy misery more things like men eat timon and abhor them
