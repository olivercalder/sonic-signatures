which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen but see but see give me youth whatsoever thou art thou art but a scurvy fellow wonder not nor admire not in thy mind why i do call thee so for i will show thee no reason for 't thou com'st to the lady olivia and in my sight she uses thee kindly but thou liest in thy throat that is not the matter i challenge thee for i will waylay thee going home where if it be thy chance to kill me  thou kill'st me like a rogue and a villain fare thee well and god have mercy upon one of our souls he may have mercy upon

for him at the corner of the orchard like a bum baily so soon as ever thou seest him draw and as thou draw'st swear horrible for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him away now will not i deliver his letter for the behavior of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no terror in the youth he will find it comes from a clodpoll but sir i will deliver his challenge by word of mouth set upon aguecheek a notable report of valor and drive the gentleman as i know his youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity this will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look like cockatrices i will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge gentleman god save thee that defense thou hast betake thee to 't of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him i know not but thy intercepter full of despite bloody as the hunter attends thee at the orchard end dismount thy tuck be yare in thy preparation for thy assailant is quick skillful and deadly you'll find it otherwise i assure you therefore if you hold your life at any price betake you to your guard for your opposite hath in him what youth strength skill and wrath can furnish man withal he is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration but he is a devil in private brawl souls and bodies hath he divorced three and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulcher hob nob is his word give 't or take 't sir no his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury therefore get you on and give him his desire back you shall not to the house unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him therefore on or strip your sword stark naked for meddle you must that's certain or forswear to wear iron about you i will do so signior fabian stay you by this gentleman till my return why man he's a very devil i have not seen such a firago i had a pass with him rapier scabbard and all and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable and on the answer he pays you as surely as your feet hits the ground they step on they say he has been fencer to the sophy ay but he will not now be pacified fabian can scarce hold him yonder i'll make the motion stand here make a good show on 't this shall end without the perdition of souls marry i'll ride your horse as well as i ride you i have his horse to take up the quarrel i have persuaded him the youth's a devil there's no remedy sir he will fight with you for 's oath sake marry he hath better bethought him of his quarrel and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of therefore draw for the supportance of his vow he protests he will not hurt you come sir andrew there's no remedy the gentleman will for his honor's sake have one bout with you he cannot by the duello avoid it but he has promised me as he is a gentleman and a soldier he will not hurt you come on to 't you sir why what are you nay if you be an undertaker i am for you i'll be with you anon come hither knight come hither fabian we'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws a very dishonest paltry boy and more a coward than a hare his dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him and for his cowardship ask fabian do cuff him soundly but never draw thy sword i dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet hold sir or i'll throw your dagger o'er the house come on sir hold come sir i will not let you go come my young soldier put up your iron you are well fleshed come on what what nay then i must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you madam jove bless thee master parson to him sir topas the knave counterfeits well a good knave well said master parson my most exquisite sir topas to him in thine own voice and bring me word how thou find'st him i would we were well rid of this knavery if he may be conveniently delivered i would he were for i am now so far in offense with my niece that i cannot pursue with any safety this sport the upshot come by and by to my chamber that's all one has hurt me and there's th' end on 't sot didst see dick surgeon sot then he's a rogue and a passy measures pavin i hate a drunken rogue will you help an ass head and a coxcomb and a knave a thin faced knave a gull
