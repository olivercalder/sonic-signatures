neither disturbed with the effect of wine nor heady rash provoked with raging ire albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad this woman locked me out this day from dinner that goldsmith there were he not packed with her could witness it for he was with me then who parted with me to go fetch a chain promising to bring it to the porpentine where balthasar and i did dine together our dinner done and he not coming thither i went to seek him in the street i met him and in his company that gentleman there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down that i this day of him received the chain which god he knows i saw not for the which he did arrest me with an officer i did obey and sent my peasant home for certain ducats he with none returned then fairly i bespoke the officer to go in person with me to my house by th' way we met my wife her sister and a rabble more of vile confederates along with them they brought one pinch a hungry lean faced villain a mere anatomy a mountebank a threadbare juggler and a fortune teller a needy hollow eyed sharp looking wretch a living dead man this pernicious slave forsooth took on him as a conjurer and gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse and with no face as 'twere outfacing me cries out i was possessed then all together they fell upon me bound me bore me thence and in a dark and dankish vault at home there left me and my man both bound together till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder i gained my freedom and immediately ran hither to your grace whom i beseech to give me ample satisfaction for these deep shames and great indignities i never came within these abbey walls nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me i never saw the chain so help me heaven and this is false you burden me withal 'tis true my liege this ring i had of her i never saw you in my life till now neither i never saw my father in my life the duke and all that know me in the city can witness with me that it is not so i ne'er saw syracusa in my life i came from corinth my most gracious lord brought to this town by that most famous warrior duke menaphon your most renownèd uncle no i say nay to that and you sir for this chain arrested me these ducats pawn i for my father here there take it and much thanks for my good cheer dromio what stuff of mine hast thou embarked
