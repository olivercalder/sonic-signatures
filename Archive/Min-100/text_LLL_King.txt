let fame that all hunt after in their lives live registered upon our brazen tombs and then grace us in the disgrace of death when spite of cormorant devouring time th' endeavor of this present breath may buy that honor which shall bate his scythe's keen edge and make us heirs of all eternity therefore brave conquerors for so you are that war against your own affections and the huge army of the world's desires our late edict shall strongly stand in force navarre shall be the wonder of the world our court shall be a little academe still and contemplative in living art you three berowne dumaine and longaville have sworn for three years' term to live with me my fellow scholars and to keep those statutes that are recorded in this schedule here your oaths are passed and now subscribe

to pass away from these why that to know which else we should not know ay that is study's godlike recompense these be the stops that hinder study quite and train our intellects to vain delight how well he's read to reason against reading berowne is like an envious sneaping frost that bites the firstborn infants of the spring well sit you out go home berowne adieu how well this yielding rescues thee from shame what say you lords why this was quite forgot we must of force dispense with this decree she must lie here on mere necessity ay that there is our court you know is haunted with a refinèd traveler of spain a man in all the world's new fashion planted that hath a mint of phrases in his brain one who the music of his own vain tongue doth ravish like enchanting harmony a man of compliments whom right and wrong have chose as umpire of their mutiny this child of fancy that armado hight for interim to our studies shall relate in high born words the worth of many a knight from tawny spain lost in the world's debate how you delight my lords i know not i but i protest i love to hear him lie and i will use him for my minstrelsy a letter from the magnificent armado will you hear this letter with attention great deputy the welkin's vicegerent and sole dominator of navarre my soul's earth's god and body's fost'ring patron  so it is  peace no words so it is besieged with sable colored melancholy i did commend the black oppressing humor to the most wholesome physic of thy health giving air and as i am a gentleman betook myself to walk the time when about the sixth hour when beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper so much for the time when now for the ground which which i mean i walked upon it is yclept thy park then for the place where where i mean i did encounter that obscene and most prepost'rous event that draweth from my snow white pen the ebon colored ink which here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest but to the place where it standeth north north east and by east from the west corner of thy curious knotted garden there did i see that low spirited swain that base minnow of thy mirth  that unlettered small knowing soul  that shallow vassal  which as i remember hight costard  sorted and consorted contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon which with o with but with this i passion to say wherewith  with a child of our grandmother eve a female or for thy more sweet understanding a woman him i as my ever esteemed duty pricks me on have sent to thee to receive the meed of punishment by thy sweet grace's officer anthony dull a man of good repute carriage bearing and estimation for jaquenetta so is the weaker vessel called which i apprehended with the aforesaid swain i keep her as a vessel of thy law's fury and shall at the least of thy sweet notice bring her to trial thine in all compliments of devoted and heartburning heat of duty don adriano de armado ay the best for the worst but sirrah what say you to this did you hear the proclamation it was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a wench well it was proclaimed damsel this maid will not serve your turn sir sir i will pronounce your sentence you shall fast a week with bran and water and don armado shall be your keeper my lord berowne see him delivered o'er and go we lords to put in practice that which each to other hath so strongly sworn fair princess welcome to the court of navarre you shall be welcome madam to my court hear me dear lady i have sworn an oath not for the world fair madam by my will your ladyship is ignorant what it is madam i will if suddenly i may madam your father here doth intimate the payment of a hundred thousand crowns being but the one half of an entire sum disbursèd by my father in his wars but say that he or we as neither have received that sum yet there remains unpaid a hundred thousand more in surety of the which one part of aquitaine is bound to us although not valued to the money's worth if then the king your father will restore but that one half which is unsatisfied we will give up our right in aquitaine and hold fair friendship with his majesty but that it seems he little purposeth for here he doth demand to have repaid a hundred thousand crowns and not demands on payment of a hundred thousand crowns to have his title live in aquitaine  which we much rather had depart withal and have the money by our father lent than aquitaine so gelded as it is dear princess were not his requests so far from reason's yielding your fair self should make a yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast and go well satisfied to france again i do protest i never heard of it and if you prove it i'll repay it back or yield up aquitaine satisfy me so it shall suffice me at which interview all liberal reason i will yield unto meantime receive such welcome at my hand as honor without breach of honor may make tender of to thy true worthiness

tears of mine give light thou shin'st in every tear that i do weep no drop but as a coach doth carry thee so ridest thou triumphing in my woe do but behold the tears that swell in me and they thy glory through my grief will show but do not love thyself then thou wilt keep my tears for glasses and still make me weep o queen of queens how far dost thou excel no thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell how shall she know my griefs i'll drop the paper sweet leaves shade folly who is he comes here what longaville and reading listen ear in love i hope sweet fellowship in shame and mine too good lord come sir you blush as his your case is such you chide at him offending twice as much you do not love maria longaville did never sonnet for her sake compile nor never lay his wreathèd arms athwart his loving bosom to keep down his heart i have been closely shrouded in this bush and marked you both and for you both did blush i heard your guilty rhymes observed your fashion saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion ay me says one o jove the other cries one her hairs were gold crystal the other's eyes you would for paradise break faith and troth and jove for your love would infringe an oath what will berowne say when that he shall hear faith infringed which such zeal did swear how will he scorn how will he spend his wit how will he triumph leap and laugh at it for all the wealth that ever i did see i would not have him know so much by me too bitter is thy jest are we betrayed thus to thy overview soft whither away so fast a true man or a thief that gallops so what present hast thou there what makes treason here if it mar nothing neither the treason and you go in peace away together berowne read it over where hadst thou it where hadst thou it how now what is in

star scarce seen a light by heaven thy love is black as ebony o paradox black is the badge of hell the hue of dungeons and the school of night and beauty's crest becomes the heavens well and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack 'twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain i'll find a fairer face not washed today no devil will fright thee then so much as she but what of this are we not all in love then leave this chat and good berowne now prove our loving lawful and our faith not torn saint cupid then and soldiers to the field and win them too therefore let us devise some entertainment for them in their tents away away no time shall be omitted that will betime and may by us be fitted say to her we have measured many miles to tread a measure with her on this grass blessèd are clouds to do as such clouds do vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine those clouds removed upon our watery eyne then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change thou bidd'st me beg this begging is

simple wits fair sir god save you where's the princess that she vouchsafe me audience for one word a blister on his sweet tongue with my heart that put armado's page out of his part all hail sweet madam and fair time of day construe my speeches better if you may we came to visit you and purpose now to lead you to our court vouchsafe it then rebuke me not for that which you provoke the virtue of your eye must break my oath o you have lived in desolation here unseen unvisited much to our shame how madam russians we were descried they'll mock us now downright teach us sweet madam for our rude

come here is like to be a good presence of worthies he presents hector of troy the swain pompey the great the parish curate alexander armado's page hercules the pedant judas maccabaeus and if these four worthies in their first show thrive these four will change habits and present the other five you are deceived 'tis not so the ship is under sail and here she comes amain hector was but a troyan in respect of this i think hector was not so clean timbered how fares your majesty madam not so i do beseech you stay the extreme parts of time extremely forms all causes to the purpose of his speed and often at his very loose decides that which long process could not arbitrate and though the mourning brow of progeny forbid the smiling courtesy of love the holy suit which fain it would convince yet since love's argument was first on foot let not the cloud of sorrow jostle it from what it purposed since to wail friends lost is not by much so wholesome profitable as to rejoice at friends but newly found now at the latest minute of the hour grant us your loves if this or more than this i would deny to flatter up these powers of mine with rest the sudden hand of death close up mine eye hence hermit then my heart is in thy breast no madam we will bring you on your way come sir it wants a twelvemonth and a day and then 'twill end call them forth quickly we will do so
