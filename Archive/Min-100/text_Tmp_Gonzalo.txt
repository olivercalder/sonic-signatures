his hanging make the rope of his destiny our cable for our own doth little advantage if he be not born to be hanged our case is miserable i'll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench the king and prince at prayers let's assist them for our case is as theirs he'll be hanged yet though every drop of water swear against it and gape at wid'st to glut him now would i give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground long heath brown furze anything the wills above be done but i would fain die a dry death beseech you sir be merry you have cause  so have we all of joy for our escape is much beyond our loss our hint of woe is common every day some sailor's wife the masters of some merchant and the merchant have just our theme of woe but for the miracle  i mean our preservation few in millions can speak like us then wisely good sir weigh our sorrow with our comfort sir  when every grief is entertained that's offered comes to th' entertainer  dolor comes to him indeed you have spoken truer than you purposed therefore my lord  well i have done but yet  here is everything advantageous to life how lush and lusty the grass looks how green but the rarity of it is which is indeed almost beyond credit  that our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and gloss being rather new dyed than stained with salt water methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in afric at the marriage of the king's fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis not since widow dido's time this tunis sir was carthage i assure you carthage ay sir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage of your daughter who is now

speak it in you rub the sore when you should bring the plaster it is foul weather in us all good sir when you are cloudy had i plantation of this isle my lord  and were the king on 't what would i do

innocent people i would with such perfection govern sir t' excel the golden age and do you mark me sir i do well believe your highness and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you so you may continue and laugh at nothing still you are gentlemen of brave mettle you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing no i warrant you i will not adventure my discretion so weakly will you laugh me asleep for i am very heavy now good angels preserve the king what's the matter upon mine honor sir i heard a humming and that a strange one too which did awake me i shaked you sir and cried as mine eyes opened i saw their weapons drawn there was a noise that's verily 'tis best we stand upon our guard or that we quit this place let's draw our weapons heavens keep him from these beasts for he is sure i' th' island by 'r lakin i can go no further sir my old bones aches here's a maze trod indeed through forthrights and meanders by your patience i needs must rest me marvelous sweet music if in naples i should report this now would they believe me if i should say i saw such islanders  for certes these are people of the island  who though they are of monstrous shape yet note their manners are more gentle kind than of our human generation you shall find many nay almost any faith sir you need not fear when we were boys who would believe that there were mountaineers dewlapped like bulls whose throats had hanging at 'em wallets of flesh or that there were such men whose heads stood in their breasts which now we find each putter out of five for one will bring us good warrant of i' th' name of something holy sir why stand you in this strange stare all three of them are desperate their great guilt like poison given to work a great time after now 'gins to bite the spirits i do beseech you that are of

fearful country whether this be or be not i'll not swear i have inly wept or should have spoke ere this look down you gods and on this couple drop a bless√®d crown for it is you that have chalked forth the way which brought us hither was milan thrust from milan that his issue should become kings of naples o rejoice beyond a common joy and set it down with gold on lasting pillars in one voyage did claribel her husband find at tunis and ferdinand her brother found a wife where he himself was lost prospero his dukedom in a poor isle and all of us ourselves when no man was his own be it so amen o look sir look sir here is more of us i prophesied if a gallows were on land this fellow could not drown now blasphemy that swear'st grace o'erboard not an oath on shore hast thou no mouth by land what is the news
