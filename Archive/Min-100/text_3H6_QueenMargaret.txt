nay go not from me i will follow thee who can be patient in such extremes ah wretched man would i had died a maid and never seen thee never borne thee son seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus hadst thou but loved him half so well as i or felt that pain which i did for him once or nourished him as i did with my blood thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart blood there rather than have made that savage duke thine heir and disinherited thine only son enforced thee art thou king and wilt be forced i shame to hear thee speak ah timorous wretch thou hast undone thyself thy son and me and giv'n unto the house of york such head as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance to entail him and his heirs unto the crown what is it but to make thy sepulcher and creep into it far before thy time warwick is chancellor and the lord of callice stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas the duke is made protector of the realm and yet shalt thou be safe such safety finds the trembling lamb environèd with wolves had i been there which am a silly woman the soldiers should have tossed me on their pikes before i would have granted to that act but thou preferr'st thy life before thine honor and seeing thou dost i here divorce myself both from thy table henry and thy bed until that act of parliament be repealed whereby my son is disinherited the northern lords that have forsworn thy colors will follow mine if once they see them spread and spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace and utter ruin of the house of york thus do i leave thee come son let's away our army is ready come we'll after them thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone ay to be murdered by his enemies come son away we may not linger thus hold valiant clifford for a thousand causes i would prolong a while the traitor's life  wrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberland brave warriors clifford and northumberland come make him stand upon this molehill here that raught at mountains with outstretchèd arms yet parted but the shadow with his hand what was it you that would be england's king was 't you that reveled in our parliament and made a preachment of your high descent where are your mess of sons to back you now the wanton edward and the lusty george and where's that valiant crookback prodigy dickie your boy that with his grumbling voice was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies or with the rest where is your darling rutland look york i stained this napkin with the blood that valiant clifford with his rapier's point made issue from the bosom of the boy and if thine eyes can water for his death i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly i should lament thy miserable state i prithee grieve to make me merry york what hath thy fiery heart so parched thine entrails that not a tear can fall for rutland's death why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance thou would'st be fee'd i see to make me sport  york cannot speak unless he wear a crown a crown for york and lords bow low to him hold you his hands whilst i do set it on ay marry sir now looks he like a king ay this is he that took king henry's chair and this is he was his adopted heir but how is it that great plantagenet is crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath  as i bethink me you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death and will you pale your head in henry's glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life against your holy oath o 'tis a fault too too unpardonable off with the crown and with the crown his head and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead nay stay let's hear the orisons he makes what weeping ripe my lord northumberland think but upon the wrong he did us all and that will quickly dry thy melting tears and here's to right our gentle hearted king off with his head and set it on york gates so york may overlook the town of york welcome my lord to this brave town of york yonder's the head of that arch enemy that sought to be encompassed with your crown doth not the object cheer your heart my lord my lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh and this soft courage makes your followers faint you promised knighthood to our forward son unsheathe your sword and dub him presently  edward kneel down ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune go rate thy minions proud insulting boy becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms before thy sovereign and thy lawful king why how now long tongued warwick dare you speak when you and i met at saint albans last your legs did better service than your hands defy them then or else hold close thy lips but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam but like a foul misshapen stigmatic marked by the destinies to be avoided as venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings stay edward mount you my lord towards berwick post amain edward and richard like a brace of greyhounds having the fearful flying hare in sight with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath and bloody steel grasped in their ireful hands are at our backs and therefore hence amain no mighty king of france now margaret must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve where kings command i was i must confess great albion's queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down and with dishonor laid me on the ground where i must take like seat unto my fortune and to my humble seat conform myself from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue while heart is drowned in cares those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my tongue tied sorrows leave to speak now therefore be it known to noble lewis that henry sole possessor of my love is of a king become a banished man and forced to live in scotland a forlorn while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of england's true anointed lawful king this is the cause that i poor margaret with this my son prince edward henry's heir am come to crave thy just and lawful aid and if thou fail us all our hope is done scotland hath will to help but cannot help our people and our peers are both misled our treasure seized our soldiers put to flight and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight the more we stay the stronger grows our foe o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow our earl of warwick edward's greatest friend ay now begins a second storm to rise for this is he that moves both wind and tide if that go forward henry's hope is done king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick his demand springs not from edward's well meant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henry's son look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonor for though usurpers sway the rule awhile yet heav'ns are just and time suppresseth wrongs heavens grant that warwick's words bewitch him not deceitful warwick it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henry's friend peace impudent and shameless warwick proud setter up and puller down of kings i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys i told your majesty as much before this proveth edward's love and warwick's honesty warwick these words have turned my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becom'st king henry's friend renownèd prince how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair let me give humble thanks for all at once tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armor on yes i agree and thank you for your motion son edward she is fair and virtuous therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable that only warwick's daughter shall be thine great lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss but cheerly seek how to redress their harms what though the mast be now blown overboard the cable broke the holding anchor lost and half our sailors swallowed in the flood yet lives our pilot still is 't meet that he should leave the helm and like a fearful lad with tearful eyes add water to the sea and give more strength to that which hath too much whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock which industry and courage might have saved ah what a shame ah what a fault were this say warwick was our anchor what of that and montague our topmast what of him our slaughtered friends the tackles what of these why is not oxford here another anchor and somerset another goodly mast the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings and though unskillful why not ned and i for once allowed the skillful pilot's charge we will not from the helm to sit and weep but keep our course though the rough wind say no from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wrack as good to chide the waves as speak them fair and what is edward but a ruthless sea what clarence but a quicksand of deceit and richard but a ragged fatal rock  all these the enemies to our poor bark say you can swim alas 'tis but awhile tread on the sand why there you quickly sink bestride the rock the tide will wash you off or else you famish that's a threefold death this speak i lords to let you understand if case some one of you would fly from us that there's no hoped for mercy with the brothers more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks why courage then what cannot be avoided 'twere childish weakness to lament or fear thanks gentle somerset sweet oxford thanks this cheers my heart to see your forwardness lords knights and gentlemen what i should say my tears gainsay for every word i speak you see i drink the water of my eye therefore no more but this henry your sovereign is prisoner to the foe his state usurped his realm a slaughterhouse his subjects slain his statutes cancelled and his treasure spent and yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil you fight in justice then in god's name lords be valiant and give signal to the fight so part we sadly in this troublous world to meet with joy in sweet jerusalem ah that thy father had been so resolved ay thou wast born to be a plague to men o kill me too o ned sweet ned speak to thy mother boy canst thou not speak o traitors murderers they that stabbed caesar shed no blood at all did not offend nor were not worthy blame if this foul deed were by to equal it he was a man this in respect a child and men ne'er spend their fury on a child what's worse than murderer that i may name it no no my heart will burst an if i speak and i will speak that so my heart may burst butchers and villains bloody cannibals how sweet a plant have you untimely cropped you have no children butchers if you had the thought of them would have stirred up remorse but if you ever chance to have a child look in his youth to have him so cut off as deathsmen you have rid this sweet young prince nay never bear me hence dispatch me here here sheathe thy sword i'll pardon thee my death what wilt thou not then clarence do it thou good clarence do sweet clarence do thou do it ay but thou usest to forswear thyself 'twas sin before but now 'tis charity what wilt thou not where is that devil's butcher richard hard favored richard richard where art thou thou art not here murder is thy alms deed petitioners for blood thou ne'er putt'st back so come to you and yours as to this prince
