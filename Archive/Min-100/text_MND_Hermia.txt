so is lysander i would my father looked but with my eyes i do entreat your grace to pardon me i know not by what power i am made bold nor how it may concern my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts but i beseech your grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case if i refuse to wed demetrius so will i grow so live so die my lord ere i will yield my virgin patent up unto his lordship whose unwishèd yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty belike for want of rain which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes o cross too high to be enthralled to low o spite too old to be engaged to young o hell to choose love by another's eyes if then true lovers have been ever crossed it stands as an edict in destiny then let us teach our trial patience because it is a customary cross as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs wishes and tears poor fancy's followers my good lysander i swear to thee by cupid's strongest bow by his best arrow with the golden head by the simplicity of venus' doves by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves and by that fire which burned the carthage queen when the false trojan under sail was seen by all the vows that ever men have broke in number more than ever women spoke in that same place thou hast appointed me tomorrow truly will i meet with thee godspeed fair helena whither away i frown upon him yet he loves me still i give him curses yet he gives me love the more i hate the more he follows me his folly helena is no fault of mine take comfort he no more shall see my face lysander and myself will fly this place before the time i did lysander see seemed athens as a paradise to me o then what graces in my love do dwell that he hath turned a heaven unto a hell and in the wood where often you and i upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet there my lysander and myself shall meet and thence from athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger companies farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us and good luck grant thee thy demetrius  keep word lysander we must starve our sight from lovers' food till morrow deep midnight be it so lysander find you out a bed for i upon this bank will rest my head nay good lysander for my sake my dear lie further off yet do not lie so near lysander riddles very prettily now much beshrew my manners and my pride if hermia meant to say lysander lied but gentle friend for love and courtesy lie further off in human modesty such separation as may well be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid so far be distant and good night sweet friend thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end with half that wish the wisher's eyes be pressed help me lysander help me do thy best to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast ay me for pity what a dream was here lysander look how i do quake with fear methought a serpent ate my heart away and you sat smiling at his cruel prey lysander what removed lysander lord what out of hearing gone no sound no word alack where are you speak an if you hear speak of all loves i swoon almost with fear  no then i well perceive you are not nigh either death or you i'll find immediately now i but chide but i should use thee worse for thou i fear hast given me cause to curse if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep being o'er shoes in blood plunge in the deep and kill me too the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me would he have stolen away from sleeping hermia i'll believe as soon this whole earth may be bored and that the moon may through the center creep and so displease her brother's noontide with th' antipodes it cannot be but thou hast murdered him so should a murderer look so dead so grim what's this to my lysander where is he ah good demetrius wilt thou give him me out dog out cur thou driv'st me past the bounds of maiden's patience hast thou slain him then henceforth be never numbered among men o once tell true tell true even for my sake durst thou have looked upon him being awake and hast thou killed him sleeping o brave touch could not a worm an adder do so much an adder did it for with doubler tongue than thine thou serpent never adder stung i pray thee tell me then that he is well a privilege never to see me more and from thy hated presence part i so see me no more whether he be dead or no dark night that from the eye his function takes the ear more quick of apprehension makes wherein it doth impair the seeing sense it pays the hearing double recompense thou art not by mine eye lysander found mine ear i thank it brought me to thy sound but why unkindly didst thou leave me so what love could press lysander from my side you speak not as you think it cannot be i am amazèd at your words i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me i understand not what you mean by this sweet do not scorn her so lysander whereto tends all this why are you grown so rude what change is this sweet love do you not jest what can you do me greater harm than hate hate me wherefore o me what news my love am not i hermia are not you lysander i am as fair now as i was erewhile since night you loved me yet since night you left me why then you left me o the gods forbid  in earnest shall i say o me you juggler you cankerblossom you thief of love what have you come by night and stol'n my love's heart from him puppet why so ay that way goes the game now i perceive that she hath made compare between our statures she hath urged her height and with her personage her tall personage her height forsooth she hath prevailed with him and are you grown so high in his esteem because i am so dwarfish and so low how low am i thou painted maypole speak how low am i i am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes lower hark again why get you gone who is 't that hinders you what with lysander little again nothing but low and little why will you suffer her to flout me thus let me come to her you mistress all this coil is long of you nay go not back i am amazed and know not what to say never so weary never so in woe bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers i can no further crawl no further go my legs can keep no pace with my desires here will i rest me till the break of day heavens shield lysander if they mean a fray methinks i see these things with parted eye when everything seems double yea and my father
