are the knights ready to begin the triumph return them we are ready and our daughter here in honor of whose birth these triumphs are sits here like beauty's child whom nature gat for men to see and seeing wonder at it's fit it should be so for princes are a model which heaven makes like to itself as jewels lose their glory if neglected so princes their renowns if not respected 'tis now your honor daughter to entertain the labor of each knight in his device who is the first that doth prefer himself he loves you well that holds his life of you who is the second that presents himself and what's the third what is the fourth which shows that beauty hath his power and will which can as well inflame as it can kill and what's the sixth and last the which the knight himself with such a graceful courtesy delivered a pretty moral from the dejected state wherein he is he hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish opinion's but a fool that makes us scan the outward habit by the inward man but stay the knights are coming we will withdraw into the gallery knights to say you're welcome were superfluous to place upon the volume of your deeds as in a title page your worth in arms were more than you expect or more than 's fit since every worth in show commends itself prepare for mirth for mirth becomes a feast you are princes and my guests call it by what you will the day is yours and here i hope is none that envies it in framing an artist art hath thus decreed to make some good but others to exceed and you are her labored scholar come queen o' the feast for daughter so you are here take your place  marshal the rest as they deserve their grace your presence glads our days honor we love for who hates honor hates the gods above sit sir sit by jove i wonder that is king of thoughts these cates resist me he not thought upon he's but a country gentleman has done no more than other knights have done has broken a staff or so so let it pass what are you merry knights here with a cup that's stored unto the brim as do you love fill to your mistress' lips we drink this health to you yet pause awhile yon knight doth sit too melancholy as if the entertainment in our court had not a show might countervail his worth  note it not you thaisa o attend my daughter princes in this should live like gods above who freely give to everyone that come to honor them and princes not doing so are like to gnats which make a sound but killed are wondered at therefore to make his entrance more sweet here say we drink this standing bowl of wine to him how do as i bid you or you'll move me else and furthermore tell him we desire to know of him of whence he is his name and parentage now by the gods i pity his misfortune and will awake him from his melancholy  come gentlemen we sit too long on trifles and waste the time which looks for other revels even in your armors as you are addressed will well become a soldiers' dance i will not have excuse with saying this loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads since they love men in arms as well as beds so this was well asked 'twas so well performed come sir here's a lady that wants breathing too and i have heard you knights of tyre are excellent in making ladies trip and that their measures are as excellent o that's as much as you would be denied of your fair courtesy unclasp unclasp thanks gentlemen to all all have done well but you the best pages and lights to conduct these knights unto their several lodgingsyours sir we have given order be next our own princes it is too late to talk of love and that's the mark i know you level at therefore each one betake him to his rest tomorrow all for speeding do their best knights from my daughter this i let you know that for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake a married life her reason to herself is only known which from her by no means can i get faith by no means she hath so strictly tied her to her chamber that 'tis impossible one twelve moons more she'll wear diana's livery this by the eye of cynthia hath she vowed and on her virgin honor will not break it so they are well dispatched now to my daughter's letter she tells me here she'll wed the stranger knight or never more to view nor day nor light 'tis well mistress your choice agrees with mine i like that well nay how absolute she's in 't not minding whether i dislike or no well i do commend her choice and will no longer have it be delayed soft here he comes i must dissemble it to you as much sir i am beholding to you for your sweet music this last night i do protest my ears were

very well of you ay so well that you must be her master and she will be your scholar therefore look to it she thinks not so peruse this writing else thou hast bewitched my daughter and thou art a villain traitor thou liest ay traitor now by the gods i do applaud his courage no here comes my daughter she can witness it yea mistress are you so peremptory i am glad on 't with all my heart  i'll tame you i'll bring you in subjection will you not having my consent bestow your love and your affections upon a stranger who for aught i know may be nor can i think the contrary  as great in blood as i myself  therefore hear you mistress either frame your will to mine and you sir hear you either be ruled by me or i'll make you man and wife nay come your hands and lips must seal it too and being joined i'll thus your hopes destroy and for further grief god give you joy what are you both pleased what are you both agreed it pleaseth me so well that i will see you wed and then with what haste
