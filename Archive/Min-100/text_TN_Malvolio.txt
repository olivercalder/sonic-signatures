men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools' zanies madam yond young fellow swears he will speak with you i told him you were sick he takes on him to understand so much and therefore comes to speak with you i told him you were asleep he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too and therefore comes to speak with you what is to be said to him lady he's fortified against

and your misdemeanors you are welcome to the house if not an it would please you to take leave of her she is very willing to bid you farewell is 't even so this is much credit to you mistress mary if you prized my lady's favor at anything more than contempt you would not give means for this uncivil rule she shall know of it by this hand 'tis but fortune all is fortune maria once told me she did affect me and i have heard herself come thus near that should she fancy it should be one of my complexion besides she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her what should i think on 't to be count malvolio there is example for 't the lady of the strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe having been three months married to her sitting in my state  calling my officers about me in my branched velvet gown having come from a daybed where i have left olivia sleeping  and then to have the humor of state and after a demure travel of regard telling them i know my place as i would they should do theirs to ask for my kinsman toby  seven of my people with an obedient start make out for him i frown the while and perchance wind up my watch or play with my some rich jewel toby approaches curtsies there to me  i extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control  saying cousin toby my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech  you must amend your drunkenness besides you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight  one sir andrew what employment have we here by my life this is my lady's hand these be her very 's her 's and her 's and thus she makes her great 's it is in contempt of question her hand to the unknown beloved this and my good wishes her very phrases by your leave wax

numbers altered no man must know if this should be thee malvolio i may command where i adore but silence like a lucrece knife with bloodless stroke my heart doth gore moai doth sway my life moai doth sway my life nay but first let me see let me see let me see i may command where i adore why she may command me i serve her she is my lady why this is evident to any formal capacity there is no obstruction in this and the end what should that alphabetical position portend if i could make that resemble something in me softly moai  m malvolio m why that begins my name m but then there is no consonancy in the sequel that suffers under probation a should follow but o does and then i comes behind moai this simulation is not as the former and yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for every one of these letters are in my name soft here follows prose if this fall into thy hand revolve in my stars i am above thee but be not afraid of greatness some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon 'em thy fates open their hands let thy blood and spirit embrace them and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be cast thy humble slough and appear

thy yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever cross gartered i say remember go to thou art made if thou desir'st to be so if not let me see thee a steward still the fellow of servants and not worthy to touch fortune's fingers farewell she that would alter services with thee the fortunate unhappy daylight and champian discovers not more this is open i will be proud i will read politic authors i will baffle sir toby i will wash off gross acquaintance i will be point devise the very man i do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me for every reason excites to this that my lady loves me she did commend my yellow stockings of late she did praise my leg being cross gartered and in this she manifests herself to my love and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking i thank my stars i am happy i will be strange stout in yellow stockings and cross gartered even with the swiftness of putting on jove and my stars be praised here is yet a postscript thou canst not choose but know who i am if thou entertain'st my love let it appear in thy smiling thy smiles become thee well therefore in my presence still smile dear my sweet i prithee jove i thank thee

the sweet roman hand to bed ay sweetheart and i'll come to thee at your request yes nightingales answer daws be not afraid of greatness 'twas well writ some are born great  some achieve greatness  and

still o ho do you come near me now no worse man than sir toby to look to me this concurs directly with the letter she sends him on purpose that i may appear stubborn to him for she incites me to that in the letter cast thy humble slough says she be opposite with a kinsman surly with servants let thy tongue tang with arguments of state put thyself into the trick of singularity and consequently sets down the manner how as a sad face a reverend carriage a slow tongue in the habit of some sir of note and so forth i have limed her but it is jove's doing and jove make me thankful and when she went away now let this fellow be looked to fellow not malvolio nor after my degree but fellow why everything adheres together that no dram of a scruple no scruple of a scruple no obstacle no incredulous or
