the declined is he shall as soon read in the eyes of others as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies show not their mealy wings but to the summer and not a man for being simply man hath any honor but honor for those honors that are without him as place riches and favor prizes of accident as oft as merit which when they fall as being slippery slanders the love that leaned on them as slippery too doth one pluck down another and together die in the fall but 'tis not so with me fortune and i are friends i do enjoy at ample point all that i did possess save these men's looks who do methinks find out something not worth in me such rich beholding as they have often given here is ulysses i'll interrupt his reading how now ulysses what are you reading this is not strange ulysses the beauty that is borne here in the face the bearer knows not but commends itself to others' eyes nor doth the eye itself that most pure spirit of sense behold itself not going from itself but eye to eye
