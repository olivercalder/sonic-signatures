offended in a dream all sects all ages smack of this vice and he to die for 't is it your will claudio shall die tomorrow lest i might be too rash under your good correction i have seen when after execution judgment hath repented o'er his doom i crave your honor's pardon what shall be done sir with the groaning juliet she's very near her hour ay my good lord a very virtuous maid and to be shortly of a sisterhood if not already save your honor heaven give thee moving graces pray heaven she win him i am the provost what's your will good friar i would do more than that if more were needful look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine who falling in the flaws of her own youth hath blistered her report she is with child and he that got it sentenced a young man more fit to do another such offense than die for this as i do think tomorrow i have provided for you stay awhile and you shall be conducted 'tis pity of him who's there come in the wish deserves a welcome and very welcome look signior here's your sister as many as you please what's your will father in good time a bawd of eleven years' continuance may it please your honor so please you this friar hath been with him and advised him for th' entertainment of death come hither sirrah can you cut off a man's head come sir leave me your snatches and yield me a direct answer tomorrow morning are to die claudio and barnardine here is in our prison a common executioner who in his office lacks a helper if you will take it on you to assist him it shall redeem you from your gyves if not you shall have your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping for you have been a notorious bawd what ho abhorson where's abhorson there sirrah here's a fellow will help you tomorrow in your execution if you think it meet compound with him by the year and let him abide here with you if not use him for the present and dismiss him he cannot plead his estimation with you he hath been a bawd go to sir you weigh equally a feather will turn the scale are you agreed you sirrah provide your block and your axe tomorrow four o'clock call hither barnardine and claudio th' one has my pity not a jot the other being a murderer though he were my brother look here's the warrant claudio for thy death 'tis now dead midnight and by eight tomorrow thou must be made immortal where's barnardine who can do good on him well go prepare yourself but hark what noise  heaven give your spirits comfortby and by  i hope it is some pardon or reprieve for the most gentle claudio welcome father none since the curfew rung no what comfort is for claudio it is a bitter deputy there he must stay until the officer arise to let him in he is called up none sir none happily you something know yet i believe there comes no countermand no such example have we besides upon the very siege of justice lord angelo hath to the public ear professed the contrary this is his lordship's man i shall obey him i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted putting on methinks strangely for he hath not used it before whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon barnardine for my better satisfaction let me have claudio's head sent me by five let this be duly performed with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver thus fail not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril what say you to this sir a bohemian born but here nursed up and bred one that is a prisoner nine years old his friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of lord angelo came not to an undoubtful proof most manifest and not denied by himself a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what's past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all pray sir in what alack how may i do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of angelo i may make my case as claudio's to cross this in the smallest angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favor pardon me good father it is against my oath to him and to his substitutes but what likelihood is in that i know them both now sir how do you find the prisoner here in the prison father there died this morning of a cruel fever one ragozine a most notorious pirate a man of claudio's years his beard and head just of his color what if we do omit this reprobate till he were well inclined and satisfy the deputy with the visage of ragozine more like to claudio this shall be done good father presently but barnardine must die this afternoon and how shall we continue claudio to save me from the danger that might come if he were known alive i am your free dependent here is the head i'll carry it myself i'll make all speed it was commanded so no my good lord it was by private message pardon me noble lord i thought it was a fault but knew it not yet did repent me after more advice for testimony whereof one in the prison that should by private order else have died i have reserved alive his name is barnardine this my lord this is another prisoner that i saved who should have died when claudio lost his head as like almost to claudio as himself
