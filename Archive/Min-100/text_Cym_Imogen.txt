shouldst have made him as little as a crow or less ere left to after eye him i would have broke mine eyestrings cracked them but to look upon him till the diminution of space had pointed him sharp as my needle nay followed him till he had melted from the smallness of a gnat to air and then have turned mine eye and wept but good pisanio when shall we hear from him i did not take my leave of him but had most pretty things to say ere i could tell him how i would think on him at certain hours such thoughts and such or i could make him swear the shes of italy should not betray mine interest and his honor or have charged him at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight t' encounter me with orisons for then i am in heaven for him or ere i could give him that parting kiss which i had set betwixt two charming words comes in my father and like the tyrannous breathing of the north shakes all our buds from growing those things i bid you do get them dispatched i will attend the queen a father

heart that both mine ears must not in haste abuse if it be true how should i be revenged what ho pisanio away i do condemn mine ears that have so long attended thee if thou wert honorable thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not for such an end thou seek'st as base as strange thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far from thy report as thou from honor and solicits here a lady that disdains thee and the devil alike what ho pisanio  the king my father shall be made acquainted of thy assault if he shall think it fit a saucy stranger in his court to mart as in a romish stew and to expound his beastly mind to us he hath a court he little cares for and a daughter who he not respects at all what ho pisanio you make amends all's well sir take my power i' th' court for yours pray what is 't

the tempters of the night guard me beseech you good morrow sir you lay out too much pains for purchasing but trouble the thanks i give is telling you that i am poor of thanks and scarce can spare them if you but said so 'twere as deep with me if you swear still your recompense is still that i regard it not but that you shall not say i yield being silent i would not speak i pray you spare me faith i shall unfold equal discourtesy to your best kindness one of your great knowing should learn being taught forbearance fools are not mad folks as i am mad i do if you'll be patient i'll no more be mad that cures us both i am much sorry sir you put me to forget a lady's manners by being so verbal and learn now for all that i which know my heart do here pronounce by th' very truth of it i care not for you and am so near the lack of charity to accuse myself i hate you which i had rather you felt than make 't my boast profane fellow wert thou the son of jupiter and no more but what thou art besides thou wert too base to be his groom thou wert dignified enough even to the point of envy if 'twere made comparative for your virtues to be styled the under hangman of his kingdom and hated for being preferred so well he never can meet more mischance than come to be but named of thee his mean'st garment that ever hath but clipped his body is dearer in my respect than all the hairs above thee were they all made such men how now pisanio to dorothy my woman hie thee presently i am sprighted with a fool frighted and angered worse go bid my woman search for a jewel that too casually hath left mine arm it was thy master's shrew me if i would lose it for a revenue of any king's in europe i do think i saw 't this morning confident i am last night 'twas on mine arm i kissed it i hope it be not gone to tell my lord that i kiss aught but he i hope so go and search ay i said so sir if you will make 't an action call witness to 't your mother too she's my good lady and will conceive i hope but the worst of me so i leave you sir to th' worst of discontent how now pisanio who thy lord that is my lord leonatus o learned indeed were that astronomer that knew the stars as i his characters he'd lay the future open you good gods let what is here contained relish of love of my lord's health of his content yet not that we two are asunder let that grieve him some griefs are med'cinable that is one of them for it doth physic love of his content all but in that good wax thy leave blest be you bees that make these locks of counsel lovers and men in dangerous bonds pray not alike though forfeiters you cast in prison yet you clasp young cupid's tables good news gods justice and your father's wrath should he take me in his dominion could not be so cruel to me as you o the dearest of creatures would even renew me with your eyes take notice that i am in cambria at milford haven what your own love will out of this advise you follow so he wishes you all happiness that remains loyal to his vow and your increasing in love leonatus posthumus o for a horse with wings hear'st thou pisanio he is at milford haven read and tell me how far 'tis thither if one of mean affairs may plod it in a week why may not i glide thither in a day then true pisanio who long'st like me to see thy lord who long'st  o let me bate but not like me yet long'st but in a fainter kind o not like me for mine's beyond beyond say and speak thick  love's counselor should fill the bores of hearing to th' smothering of the sense how far it is to this same blessèd milford and by th' way tell me how wales was made so happy as t' inherit such a haven but first of all how we may steal from hence and for the gap that we shall make in time from our hence going and our return to excuse but first how get hence why should excuse be born or ere begot we'll talk of that hereafter prithee speak how many score of miles may we well rid 'twixt hour and hour why one that rode to 's execution man could never go so slow i have heard of riding wagers where horses have been nimbler than the sands that run i' th' clock's behalf but this is fool'ry go bid my woman feign a sickness say she'll home to her father and provide me presently a riding suit no costlier than would fit a franklin's huswife i see before me man nor here nor here nor what ensues but have a fog in them that i cannot look through away i prithee do as i bid thee there's no more to say accessible is none but milford way thou told'st me when we came from horse the place was near at hand ne'er longed my mother so to see me first as i have now pisanio man where is posthumus what is in thy mind that makes thee stare thus wherefore breaks that sigh from th' inward of thee one but painted thus would be interpreted a thing perplexed beyond self explication put thyself into a havior of less fear ere wildness vanquish my staider senses what's the matter why tender'st thou that paper to me with a look untender if 't be summer news smile to 't before if winterly thou need'st but keep that count'nance still my husband's hand that drug damned italy hath out craftied him and he's at some hard point speak man thy tongue may take off some extremity which to read would be even mortal to me thy mistress pisanio hath played the strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lies bleeding in me i speak not out of weak surmises but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as i expect my revenge that part thou pisanio must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers let thine own hands take away her life i shall give thee opportunity at milford haven she hath my letter for the purpose where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done thou art the pander to her dishonor and equally to me disloyal false to his bed what is it to be false to lie in watch there and to think on him to weep 'twixt clock and clock if sleep charge nature to break it with a fearful dream of him and cry myself awake that's false to 's bed is it i false thy conscience witness iachimo thou didst accuse him of incontinency thou then looked'st like a villain now methinks thy favor's good enough some jay of italy whose mother was her painting hath betrayed him poor i am stale a garment out of fashion and for i am richer than to hang by th' walls i must be ripped to pieces with me o men's vows are women's traitors all good seeming by thy revolt o husband shall be thought put on for villainy not born where 't grows but worn a bait for ladies true honest men being heard like false aeneas were in his time thought false and sinon's weeping did scandal many a holy tear took pity from most true wretchedness so thou posthumus wilt lay the leaven on all proper men goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured from thy great fail come fellow be thou honest do thou thy master's bidding when thou seest him a little witness my obedience look i draw the sword myself take it and hit the innocent mansion of my love my heart fear not 'tis empty of all things but grief thy master is not there who was indeed the riches of it do his bidding strike thou mayst be valiant in a better cause but now thou seem'st a coward why i must die and if i do not by thy hand thou art no servant of thy master's against self slaughter there is a prohibition so divine that cravens my weak hand come here's my heart  something's afore 't soft soft we'll no defense  obedient as the scabbard what is here the scriptures of the loyal leonatus all turned to heresy away away corrupters of my faith you shall no more be stomachers to my heart thus may poor fools believe false teachers though those that are betrayed do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor stands in worse case of woe and thou posthumus that didst set up my disobedience 'gainst the king my father and make me put into contempt the suits of princely fellows shalt hereafter find it is no act of common passage but a strain of rareness and i grieve myself to think when thou shalt be disedged by her that now thou tirest on how thy memory will then be panged by me prithee dispatch the lamb entreats the butcher where's thy knife thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding when i desire it too do 't and to bed then wherefore then didst undertake it why hast thou abused so many miles with a pretense this place mine action and thine own our horses' labor the time inviting thee the perturbed court for my being absent whereunto i never purpose return why hast thou gone so far to be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand th' elected deer before thee talk thy tongue weary speak i have heard i am a strumpet and mine ear therein false struck can take no greater wound nor tent to bottom that but speak most like bringing me here to kill me some roman courtesan why good fellow what shall i do the while where bide how live or in my life what comfort when i am dead to my husband no court no father nor no more ado with that harsh noble simple nothing that cloten whose love suit hath been to me as fearful as a siege where then hath britain all the sun that shines day night are they not but in britain i' th' world's volume our britain seems as of it but not in 't in a great pool a swan's nest prithee think there's livers out of britain o for such means though peril to my modesty not death on 't i would adventure nay be brief i see into thy end and am almost a man already thou art all the comfort the gods will diet me with prithee away there's more to be considered but we'll even all that good time will give us this attempt i am soldier to and will abide it with a prince's courage away i prithee amen i thank thee i see a man's life is a tedious one i have tired myself and for two nights together have made the ground my bed i should be sick but that my resolution helps me milford when from the mountain top pisanio showed thee thou wast within a ken o jove i think foundations fly the wretched such i mean where they should be relieved two beggars told me i could not miss my way will poor folks lie that have afflictions on them knowing 'tis a punishment or trial yes no wonder when rich ones scarce tell true to lapse in fullness is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood is worse in kings than beggars my dear lord thou art one o' th' false ones now i think on thee my hunger's gone but even before i was at point to sink for food but what is this here is a path to 't 'tis some savage hold i were best not call i dare not call yet famine ere clean it o'erthrow nature makes it valiant plenty and peace breeds cowards hardness ever of hardiness is mother ho who's here if anything that's civil speak if savage take or lend ho no answer then i'll enter best draw my sword an if mine enemy but fear the sword like me he'll scarcely look on 't such a foe good heavens good masters harm me not before i entered here i called and thought to have begged or bought what i have took good troth i have stol'n naught nor would not though i had found gold strewed i' th' floor here's money for my meat i would have left it on the board so soon as i had made my meal and parted with prayers for the provider i see you're angry know if you kill me for my fault i should have died had i not made it to milford haven fidele sir i have a kinsman who is bound for italy he embarked at milford to whom being going almost spent with hunger i am fall'n in this offense 'mongst friends if brothers would it had been so that they had been my father's sons then had my prize been less and so more equal ballasting to thee posthumus great men that had a court no bigger than this cave that did attend themselves and had the virtue which their own conscience sealed them laying by that nothing gift of differing multitudes could not outpeer these twain pardon me gods i'd change my sex to be companion with them since leonatus false thanks sir so man and man should be but clay and clay differs in dignity whose dust is both alike i am very sick so sick i am not yet i am not well but not so citizen a wanton as to seem to die ere sick so please you leave me stick to your journal course the breach of custom is breach of all i am ill but your being by me cannot amend me society is no comfort to one not sociable i am not very sick since i can reason of it pray you trust me here  i'll rob none but myself and let me die stealing so poorly i wish you sport these are kind creatures gods what lies i have heard our courtiers say all's savage but at court experience o thou disprov'st report th' imperious seas breeds monsters for the dish poor tributary rivers as sweet fish i am sick still heart sick pisanio i'll now taste of thy drug well or ill i am bound to you yes sir to milford haven which is the way i thank you by yond bush pray how far thither ods pittikins can it be six mile yet i have gone all night faith i'll lie down and sleep but soft no bedfellow o gods and goddesses these flowers are like the pleasures of the world this bloody man the care on 't i hope i dream for so i thought i was a cave keeper and cook to honest creatures but 'tis not so 'twas but a bolt of nothing shot at nothing which the brain makes of fumes our very eyes are sometimes like our judgments blind good faith i tremble still with fear but if there be yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity as a wren's eye feared gods a part of it the dream's here still even when i wake it is without me as within me not imagined felt a headless man the garments of posthumus i know the shape of 's leg this is his hand his foot mercurial his martial thigh the brawns of hercules but his jovial face  murder in heaven how 'tis gone pisanio all curses madded hecuba gave the greeks and mine to boot be darted on thee thou conspired with that irregulous devil cloten hath here cut off my lord to write and read be henceforth treacherous damned pisanio hath with his forgèd letters damned pisanio  from this most bravest vessel of the world struck the maintop o posthumus alas where is thy head where's that ay me where's that pisanio might have killed thee at the heart and left this head on how should this be pisanio 'tis he and cloten malice and lucre in them have laid this woe here o 'tis pregnant pregnant the drug he gave me which he said was precious and cordial to me have i not found it murd'rous to th' senses that confirms it home this is pisanio's deed and cloten o give color to my pale cheek with thy blood that we the horrider may seem to those which chance to find us o my lord my lord i am nothing or if not nothing to be were better this was my master a very valiant briton and a good that here by mountaineers lies slain alas there is no more such masters i may wander from east to occident cry out for service try many all good serve truly never find such another master richard du champ if i do lie and do no harm by it though the gods hear i hope they'll pardon it say you sir fidele sir i'll follow sir but first an 't please the gods i'll hide my master from the flies as deep as these poor pickaxes can dig and when with wild wood leaves and weeds i ha' strewed his grave and on it said a century of prayers such as i can twice o'er i'll weep and sigh and leaving so his service follow you so please you entertain me i humbly thank your highness no no alack there's other work in hand i see a thing bitter to me as death your life good master must shuffle for itself he is a roman no more kin to me than i to your highness who being born your vassal am something nearer i'll tell you sir in private if you please to give me hearing fidele sir my boon is that this gentleman may render of whom he had this ring peace my lord hear hear  o get thee from my sight thou gav'st me poison dangerous fellow hence breathe not where princes are it poisoned me most like i did for i was dead why did you throw your wedded lady from you think that you are upon a rock and now throw me again your blessing
