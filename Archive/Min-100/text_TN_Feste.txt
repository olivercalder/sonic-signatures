smile not he's gagged and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges when that i was and a little tiny boy with hey ho the wind and the rain a foolish thing was but a toy for the rain it raineth every day but when i came to man's estate with hey ho the wind and the rain 'gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate for the rain it raineth every day but when i came alas to wive with hey ho the wind and the rain by swaggering could i never thrive for the rain it raineth every day but when i came unto my beds with hey ho the wind and the rain with tosspots still had drunken heads for the rain it raineth every day a great while ago the world begun with hey ho the wind and the rain but that's all one our play is done and we'll strive to please you every day
