proclaimed say this to him he's beat from his best ward to tell he longs to see his son were strong but let him say so then and let him go but let him swear so and he shall not stay we'll thwack him hence with distaffs yet of your royal presence i'll adventure the borrow of a week when at bohemia you take my lord i'll give him my commission to let him there a month behind the gest prefixed for 's parting yet good deed leontes i love thee not a jar o' th' clock behind what lady she her lord you'll stay nay but you will verily you put me off with limber vows but i though you would seek t' unsphere the stars with oaths should yet say sir no going verily you shall not go a lady's verily is as potent as a lord's will you go yet force me to keep you as a prisoner not like a guest so you shall pay your fees when you depart and save your thanks how say you my prisoner or my guest by your dread verily one of them you shall be not your jailer then but your kind hostess come i'll question you of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys you were pretty lordings then was not my lord the verier wag o' th' two by this we gather you have tripped since grace to boot of this make no conclusion lest you say your queen and i are devils yet go on th' offenses we have made you do we'll answer if you first sinned with us and that with us you did continue fault and that you slipped not with any but with us he'll stay my lord never what have i twice said well when was 't before i prithee tell me cram 's with praise and make 's as fat as tame things one good deed dying tongueless slaughters a thousand waiting upon that our praises are our wages you may ride 's with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere with spur we heat an acre but to th' goal my last good deed was to entreat his stay what was my first it has an elder sister or i mistake you o would her name were grace but once before i spoke to th' purpose when nay let me have 't i long 'tis grace indeed why lo you now i have spoke to th' purpose twice the one forever earned a royal husband th' other for some while a friend he something seems unsettled you look as if you held a brow of much distraction are you moved my lord if you would seek us we are yours i' th' garden shall 's attend you there take the boy to you he so troubles me 'tis past enduring what wisdom stirs amongst you come sir now i am for you again pray you sit by us and tell 's a tale as merry as you will let's have that good sir come on sit down come on and do your best to fright me with your sprites you're powerful at it nay come sit down then on come on then and give 't me in mine ear what is this sport but i'd say he had not and i'll be sworn you would believe my saying howe'er you lean to th' nayward should a villain say so the most replenished villain in the world he were as much more villain you my lord do but mistake no by my life privy to none of this how will this grieve you when you shall come to clearer knowledge that you thus have published me gentle my lord you scarce can right me throughly then to say you did mistake there's some ill planet reigns i must be patient till the heavens look with an aspect more favorable good my lords i am not prone to weeping as our sex commonly are the want of which vain dew perchance shall dry your pities but i have that honorable grief lodged here which burns worse than tears drown beseech you all my lords with thoughts so qualified as your charities shall best instruct you measure me and so the king's will be performed who is 't that goes with me beseech your highness my women may be with me for you see my plight requires it do not weep good fools there is no cause when you shall know your mistress has deserved prison then abound in tears as i come out this action i now go on is for my better grace adieu my lord i never wished to see you sorry now i trust i shall my women come you have leave since what i am to say must be but that which contradicts my accusation and the testimony on my part no other but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me to say not guilty mine integrity being counted falsehood shall as i express it be so received but thus if powers divine behold our human actions as they do i doubt not then but innocence shall make false accusation blush and tyranny tremble at patience you my lord best know whom least will seem to do so my past life hath been as continent as chaste as true as i am now unhappy which is more than history can pattern though devised and played to take spectators for behold me a fellow of the royal bed which owe a moiety of the throne a great king's daughter the mother to a hopeful prince here standing to prate and talk for life and honor fore who please to come and hear for life i prize it as i weigh grief which i would spare for honor 'tis a derivative from me to mine and only that i stand for i appeal to your own conscience sir before polixenes came to your court how i was in your grace how merited to be so since he came with what encounter so uncurrent i have strained t' appear thus if one jot beyond the bound of honor or in act or will that way inclining hardened be the hearts of all that hear me and my near'st of kin cry fie upon my grave that's true enough though 'tis a saying sir not due to me more than mistress of which comes to me in name of fault i must not at all acknowledge for polixenes with whom i am accused i do confess i loved him as in honor he required with such a kind of love as might become a lady like me with a love even such so and no other as yourself commanded which not to have done i think had been in me both disobedience and ingratitude to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke even since it could speak from an infant freely that it was yours now for conspiracy i know not how it tastes though it be dished for me to try how all i know of it is that camillo was an honest man and why he left your court the gods themselves wotting no more than i are ignorant sir you speak a language that i understand not my life stands in the level of your dreams which i'll lay down sir spare your threats the bug which you would fright me with i seek to me can life be no commodity the crown and comfort of my life your favor i do give lost for i do feel it gone but know not how it went my second joy and first fruits of my body from his presence i am barred like one infectious my third comfort starred most unluckily is from my breast the innocent milk in it most innocent mouth haled out to murder myself on every post proclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatred the childbed privilege denied which longs to women of all fashion lastly hurried here to this place i' th' open air before i have got strength of limit now my liege tell me what blessings i have here alive that i should fear to die therefore proceed but yet hear this mistake me not no life i prize it not a straw but for mine honor which i would free if i shall be condemned upon surmises all proofs sleeping else but what your jealousies awake i tell you 'tis rigor and not law your honors all i do refer me to the oracle apollo be my judge the emperor of russia was my father o that he were alive and here beholding his daughter's trial that he did but see the flatness of my misery yet with eyes of pity not revenge praised you gods look down and from your sacred vials pour your graces upon my daughter's head tell me mine own where hast thou been preserved where lived how found thy father's court for thou shalt hear that i knowing by paulina that the oracle gave hope thou wast in being have preserved myself to see the issue
