all our followers so help me god as i dissemble not well urged my lord of warwick for sweet prince an if your grace mark every circumstance you have great reason to do richard right especially for those occasions at eltham place i told your majesty welcome high prince the mighty duke of york now will it best avail your majesty to cross the seas and to be crowned in france the presence of a king engenders love amongst his subjects and his loyal friends as it disanimates his enemies your ships already are in readiness yes if it please your majesty my liege lord bishop set the crown upon his head now governor of paris take your oath that you elect no other king but him esteem none friends but such as are his friends and none your foes but such as shall pretend malicious practices against his state this shall you do so help you righteous god to say the truth this fact was infamous and ill beseeming any common man much more a knight a captain and a leader what means his grace that he hath changed his style no more but plain and bluntly to the king hath he forgot he is his sovereign or doth this churlish superscription pretend some alteration in good will what's here i have upon especial cause moved with compassion of my country's wrack together with the pitiful complaints of such as your oppression feeds upon forsaken your pernicious faction and joined with charles the rightful king of france o monstrous treachery can this be so that in alliance amity and oaths there should be found such false dissembling guile he doth my lord and is become your foe it is the worst and all my lord he writes confirm it so confounded be your strife and perish you with your audacious prate presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed with this immodest clamorous outrage to trouble and disturb the king and us  and you my lords methinks you do not well to bear with their perverse objections much less to take occasion from their mouths to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves let me persuade you take a better course i have my lord and their intent is this they humbly sue unto your excellence to have a godly peace concluded of between the realms of england and of france well my good lord and as the only means to stop effusion of our christian blood and stablish quietness on every side besides my lord the sooner to effect and surer bind this knot of amity the earl of armagnac near knit to charles a man of great authority in france proffers his only daughter to your grace in marriage with a large and sumptuous dowry and for the proffer of my lord your master i have informed his highness so at large as liking of the lady's virtuous gifts her beauty and the value of her dower he doth intend she shall be england's queen so should i give consent to flatter sin you know my lord your highness is betrothed unto another lady of esteem how shall we then dispense with that contract and not deface your honor with reproach why what i pray is margaret more than that her father is no better than an earl although in glorious titles he excel and so the earl of armagnac may do because he is near kinsman unto charles ay grief i fear me both at first and last
