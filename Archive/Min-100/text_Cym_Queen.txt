no be assured you shall not find me daughter after the slander of most stepmothers evil eyed unto you you're my prisoner but your jailer shall deliver you the keys that lock up your restraint for you posthumus so soon as i can win th' offended king i will be known your advocate marry yet the fire of rage is in him and 'twere good you leaned unto his sentence with what patience your wisdom may inform you you know the peril i'll fetch a turn about the garden pitying the pangs of barred affections though the king hath charged you should not speak together be brief i pray you if the king come i shall incur i know not how much of his displeasure yet i'll move him to walk this way i never do him wrong but he does buy my injuries to be friends pays dear for my offenses beseech your patience peace dear lady daughter peace sweet sovereign leave us to ourselves and make yourself some comfort out of your best advice fie you must give way here is your servant how now sir what news ha no harm i trust is done i am very glad on 't this hath been your faithful servant i dare lay mine honor he will remain so pray walk awhile whiles yet the dew's on ground gather those flowers make haste who has the note of them dispatch now master doctor have you brought those drugs i wonder doctor thou ask'st me such a question have i not been thy pupil long hast thou not learned me how to make perfumes distil preserve yea so that our great king himself doth woo me oft for my confections having thus far proceeded unless thou think'st me devilish is 't not meet that i did amplify my judgment in other conclusions i will try the forces of these thy compounds on such creatures as we count not worth the hanging but none human  to try the vigor of them and apply allayments to their act and by them gather their several virtues and effects o content thee here comes a flattering rascal upon him will i first work he's for his master and enemy to my son how now pisanio  doctor your service for this time is ended take your own way hark thee a word no further service doctor until i send for thee weeps she still sayst thou dost thou think in time she will not quench and let instructions enter where folly now possesses do thou work when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son i'll tell thee on the instant thou art then as great as is thy master greater for his fortunes all lie speechless and his name is at last gasp return he cannot nor continue where he is to shift his being is to exchange one misery with another and every day that comes comes to decay a day's work in him what shalt thou expect to be depender on a thing that leans who cannot be new built nor has no friends so much as but to prop himthou tak'st up thou know'st not what but take it for thy labor it is a thing i made which hath the king five times redeemed from death i do not know what is more cordial nay i prithee take it it is an earnest of a farther good that i mean to thee tell thy mistress how the case stands with her do 't as from thyself think what a chance thou changest on but think thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son who shall take notice of thee i'll move the king to any shape of thy preferment such as thou 'lt desire and then myself i chiefly that set thee on to this desert am bound to load thy merit richly call my women think on my words a sly and constant knave not to be shaked the agent for his master and the remembrancer of her to hold the handfast to her lord i have given him that which if he take shall quite unpeople her of liegers for her sweet and which she after except she bend her humor shall be assured to taste of too so so well done well done the violets cowslips and the primroses bear to my closet fare thee well pisanio think on my words you are most bound to th' king who lets go by no vantages that may prefer you to his daughter frame yourself to orderly solicits and be friended with aptness of the season make denials increase your services so seem as if you were inspired to do those duties which you tender to her that you in all obey her save when command to your dismission tends and therein you are senseless and to kill the marvel shall be so ever that opportunity which then they had to take from 's to resume we have again remember sir my liege the kings your ancestors together with the natural bravery of your isle which stands as neptune's park ribbed and pal√®d in with rocks unscalable and roaring waters with sands that will not bear your enemies' boats but suck them up to th' topmast a kind of conquest caesar made here but made not here his brag of came and saw and overcame with shame  the first that ever touched him he was carried from off our coast twice beaten and his shipping poor ignorant baubles on our terrible seas like eggshells moved upon their surges cracked as easily 'gainst our rocks for joy whereof the famed cassibelan who was once at point  o giglet fortune to master caesar's sword made lud's town with rejoicing fires bright and britons strut with courage he goes hence frowning but it honors us that we have given him cause 'tis not sleepy business but must be looked to speedily and strongly royal sir since the exile of posthumus most retired hath her life been the cure whereof my lord 'tis time must do beseech your majesty forbear sharp speeches to her she's a lady so tender of rebukes that words are strokes and strokes death to her my lord when last i went to visit her she prayed me to excuse her keeping close whereto constrained by her infirmity she should that duty leave unpaid to you which daily she was bound to proffer this she wished me to make known but our great court made me to blame in memory son i say follow the king go look after pisanio thou that stand'st so for posthumus  he hath a drug of mine i pray his absence proceed by swallowing that for he believes it is a thing most precious but for her where is she gone haply despair hath seized her or winged with fervor of her love she's flown to her desired posthumus gone she is to death or to dishonor and my end can make good use of either she being down i have the placing of the british crown how now my son all the better may this night forestall him of the coming day
