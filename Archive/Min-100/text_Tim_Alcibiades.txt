sir you have saved my longing and i feed most hungerly on your sight my heart is ever at your service my lord so they were bleeding new my lord there's no meat like 'em i could wish my best friend at such a feast so are we all ay defiled land my lord honor health and compassion to the senate i am an humble suitor to your virtues for pity is the virtue of the law and none but tyrants use it cruelly it pleases time and fortune to lie heavy upon a friend of mine who in hot blood hath stepped into the law which is past depth to those that without heed do plunge into 't he is a man setting his fate aside  of comely virtues nor did he soil the fact with cowardice  an honor in him which buys out his fault  but with a noble fury and fair spirit seeing his reputation touched to death he did oppose his foe and with such sober and unnoted passion he did behave his anger ere 'twas spent as if he had but proved an argument my lord  my lords then under favor pardon me if i speak like a captain why do fond men expose themselves to battle and not endure all threats sleep upon 't and let the foes quietly cut their throats without repugnancy if there be such valor in the bearing what make we abroad why then women are more valiant that stay at home if bearing carry it and the ass more captain than the lion the felon loaden with irons wiser than the judge if wisdom be in suffering o my lords as you are great be pitifully good who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood to kill i grant is sin's extremest gust but in defense by mercy 'tis most just to be in anger is impiety but who is man that is not angry weigh but the crime with this in vain his service done at lacedaemon and byzantium were a sufficient briber for his life why i say my lords has done fair service and slain in fight many of your enemies how full of valor did he bear himself in the last conflict and made plenteous wounds hard fate he might have died in war my lords if not for any parts in him  though his right arm might purchase his own time and be in debt to none yet more to move you take my deserts to his and join 'em both and for i know your reverend ages love security i'll pawn my victories all my honor to you upon his good returns if by this crime he owes the law his life why let the war receive 't in valiant gore for law is strict and war is nothing more must it be so it must not be my lords i do beseech you know me call me to your remembrances i cannot think but your age has forgot me it could not else be i should prove so base to sue and be denied such common grace my wounds ache at you banish me banish your dotage banish usury that makes the senate ugly now the gods keep you old enough that you may live only in bone that none may look on you  i'm worse than mad i have kept back their foes while they have told their money and let out their coin upon large interest i myself rich only in large hurts all those for this is this the balsam that the usuring senate pours into captains' wounds banishment it comes not ill i hate not to be banished it is a cause worthy my spleen and fury that i may strike at athens i'll cheer up my discontented troops and lay for hearts 'tis honor with most lands to be at odds soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods what art thou there speak what is thy name is man so hateful to thee that art thyself a man i know thee well but in thy fortunes am unlearned and strange how came the noble timon to this change noble timon what friendship may i do thee what is it timon i have heard in some sort of thy miseries i see them now then was a blessèd time pardon him sweet timandra for his wits are drowned and lost in his calamities  i have but little gold of late brave timon the want whereof doth daily make revolt in my penurious band i have heard and grieved how cursèd athens mindless of thy worth forgetting thy great deeds when neighbor states but for thy sword and fortune trod upon them  i am thy friend and pity thee dear timon why fare thee well here is some gold for thee when i have laid proud athens on a heap  ay timon and have cause why me timon hast thou gold yet i'll take the gold thou givest me not all thy counsel strike up the drum towards athens farewell timon if i thrive well i'll visit thee again i never did thee harm call'st thou that harm we but offend him  strike sound to this coward and lascivious town our terrible approach till now you have gone on and filled the time with all licentious measure making your wills the scope of justice till now myself and such as slept within the shadow of your power have wandered with our traversed arms and breathed our sufferance vainly now the time is flush when crouching marrow in the bearer strong cries of itself no more now breathless wrong shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease and pursy insolence shall break his wind with fear and horrid flight then there's my glove descend and open your unchargèd ports those enemies of timon's and mine own whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof fall and no more and to atone your fears with my more noble meaning not a man shall pass his quarter or offend the stream of regular justice in your city's bounds but shall be remedied to your public laws at heaviest answer descend and keep your words here lies a wretched corse of wretched soul bereft seek not my name a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left here lie i timon who alive all living men did hate pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay not here thy gait these well express in thee thy latter spirits though thou abhorred'st in us our human griefs scorned'st our brains' flow and those our droplets which from niggard nature fall yet rich conceit taught thee to make vast neptune weep for aye on thy low grave on faults forgiven dead is noble timon of whose memory hereafter more bring me into your city and i will use the olive with my sword make war breed peace make peace stint war make each prescribe to other as each other's leech let our drums strike
