hail heaven out of your proof you speak we poor unfledged have never winged from view o' th' nest nor know not what air 's from home haply this life is best if quiet life be best sweeter to you that have a sharper known well corresponding with your stiff age but unto us it is a cell of ignorance traveling abed a prison for a debtor that not dares to stride a limit uncertain favor i am throughly weary there is cold meat i' th' cave we'll browse on that whilst what we have killed be cooked what's the matter sir money youth were you a woman youth i should woo hard but be your groom in honesty ay bid for you as i do buy would i could free 't pray draw near go you to hunting i'll abide with him i love thee i have spoke it  how much the quantity the weight as much as i do love my father i could not stir him he said he was gentle but unfortunate dishonestly afflicted but yet honest but his neat cookery he cut our roots in characters and sauced our broths as juno had been sick and he her dieter i do note that grief and patience rooted in them both mingle their spurs together he is but one you and my brother search what companies are near pray you away let me alone with him a thing more slavish did i ne'er than answering a slave without a knock to who to thee what art thou have not i an arm as big as thine a heart as big thy words i grant are bigger for i wear not my dagger in my mouth say what thou art why i should yield to thee no nor thy tailor rascal who is thy grandfather he made those clothes which as it seems make thee hence then and thank the man that gave them thee thou art some fool i am loath to beat thee what's thy name cloten thou double villain be thy name i cannot tremble at it were it toad or adder spider 'twould move me sooner i am sorry for 't not seeming so worthy as thy birth those that i reverence those i fear the wise at fools i laugh not fear them this cloten was a fool an empty purse there was no money in 't not hercules could have knocked out his brains for he had none yet i not doing this the fool had borne my head as i do his i am perfect what cut off one cloten's head son to the queen after his own report who called me traitor mountaineer and swore with his own single hand he'd take us in displace our heads where thank the gods they grow and set them on lud's town why worthy father what have we to lose but that he swore to take our lives the law protects not us then why should we be tender to let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us play judge and executioner all himself for we do fear the law what company discover you abroad with his own sword which he did wave against my throat i have ta'en his head from him i'll throw 't into the creek behind our rock and let it to the sea and tell the fishes he's the queen's son cloten that's all i reck where's my brother i have sent cloten's clotpole down the stream in embassy to his mother his body's hostage for his return is he at home what does he mean since death of my dear'st mother it did not speak before all solemn things should answer solemn accidents the matter triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys is jollity for apes and grief for boys is cadwal mad o sweetest fairest lily my brother wears thee not the one half so well as when thou grew'st thyself where why he but sleeps if he be gone he'll make his grave a bed with female fairies will his tomb be haunted  and worms will not come to thee prithee have done and do not play in wench like words with that which is so serious let us bury him and not protract with admiration what is now due debt to th' grave by good euriphile our mother cadwal i cannot sing i'll weep and word it with thee for notes of sorrow out of tune are worse than priests and fanes that lie pray you fetch him hither thersites' body is as good as ajax' when neither are alive nay cadwal we must lay his head to th' east my father hath a reason for 't come on then and remove him fear no more the heat o' th' sun nor the furious winter's rages thou thy worldly task hast done home art gone and ta'en thy wages golden lads and girls all must as chimney sweepers come to dust fear no more the lightning flash

therefore due fall on me by the hands of romans stand stand and fight the same dead thing alive but we see him dead this is sure fidele let me end the story i slew him there i have spoke it and i did it a most incivil one the wrongs he did me were nothing princelike for he did provoke me with language that would make me spurn the sea if it could so roar to me i cut off 's head and am right glad he is not standing here to tell this tale of mine and our good his and at first meeting loved continued so until we thought he died
