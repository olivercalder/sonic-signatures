give me your hand and let me feel your pulse i charge thee satan housed within this man to yield possession to my holy prayers and to thy state of darkness hie thee straight i conjure thee by all the saints in heaven it is no shame the fellow finds his vein and yielding to him humors well his frenzy mistress both man and master is possessed i know it by their pale and deadly looks they must be bound and laid in some dark room more company the fiend is strong within him go bind this man for he is frantic too
