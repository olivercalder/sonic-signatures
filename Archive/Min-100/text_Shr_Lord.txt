huntsman i charge thee tender well my hounds breathe merriman the poor cur is embossed and couple clowder with the deep mouthed brach saw'st thou not boy how silver made it good at the hedge corner in the coldest fault i would not lose the dog for twenty pound thou art a fool if echo were as fleet i would esteem him worth a dozen such but sup them well and look unto them all tomorrow i intend to hunt again what's here one dead or drunk see doth he breathe o monstrous beast how like a swine he lies grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image sirs i will practice on this drunken man what think you if he were conveyed to bed wrapped in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers a most delicious banquet by his bed and brave attendants near him when he wakes would not the beggar then forget himself even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy then take him up and manage well the jest carry him gently to my fairest chamber and hang it round with all my wanton pictures balm his foul head in warm distillèd waters and burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet procure me music ready when he wakes to make a dulcet and a heavenly sound and if he chance to speak be ready straight and with a low submissive reverence say what is it your honor will command let one attend him with a silver basin full of rosewater and bestrewed with flowers another bear the ewer the third a diaper and say will 't please your lordship cool your hands someone be ready with a costly suit and ask him what apparel he will wear another tell him of his hounds and horse and that his lady mourns at his disease persuade him that he hath been lunatic and when he says he is say that he dreams for he is nothing but a mighty lord this do and do it kindly gentle sirs it will be pastime passing excellent if it be husbanded with modesty take him up gently and to bed with him and each one to his office when he wakes sirrah go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds belike some noble gentleman that means traveling some journey to repose him here how now who is it bid them come near now fellows you are welcome do you intend to stay with me tonight with all my heart this fellow i remember since once he played a farmer's eldest son  'twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well i have forgot your name but sure that part was aptly fitted and naturally performed 'tis very true thou didst it excellent well you are come to me in happy time the rather for i have some sport in hand wherein your cunning can assist me much there is a lord will hear you play tonight but i am doubtful of your modesties lest over eying of his odd behavior for yet his honor never heard a play you break into some merry passion and so offend him for i tell you sirs if you should smile he grows impatient go sirrah take them to the buttery and give them friendly welcome every one let them want nothing that my house affords sirrah go you to bartholomew my page and see him dressed in all suits like a lady that done conduct him to the drunkard's chamber and call him madam do him obeisance tell him from me as he will win my love he bear himself with honorable action such as he hath observed in noble ladies unto their lords by them accomplishèd such duty to the drunkard let him do with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy and say what is 't your honor will command wherein your lady and your humble wife may show her duty and make known her love and then with kind embracements tempting kisses and with declining head into his bosom bid him shed tears as being overjoyed to see her noble lord restored to health who for this seven years hath esteemed him no better than a poor and loathsome beggar and if the boy have not a woman's gift to rain a shower of commanded tears an onion will do well for such a shift which in a napkin being close conveyed shall in despite enforce a watery eye see this dispatched with all the haste thou canst anon i'll give thee more instructions i know the boy will well usurp the grace voice gait and action of a gentlewoman i long to hear him call the drunkard husband and how my men will stay themselves from laughter when they do homage to this simple peasant i'll in to counsel them haply my presence may well abate the over merry spleen which otherwise would grow into extremes heaven cease this idle humor in your honor o that a mighty man of such descent of such possessions and so high esteem should be infusèd with so foul a spirit hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house as beaten hence by your strange lunacy o noble lord bethink thee of thy birth call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment and banish hence these abject lowly dreams look how thy servants do attend on thee each in his office ready at thy beck wilt thou have music hark apollo plays and twenty cagèd nightingales do sing or wilt thou sleep we'll have thee to a couch softer and sweeter than the lustful bed on purpose trimmed up for semiramis say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground or wilt thou ride thy horses shall be trapped their harness studded all with gold and pearl dost thou love hawking thou hast hawks will soar above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them and fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth we'll show thee io as she was a maid and how she was beguilèd and surprised as lively painted as the deed was done thou art a lord and nothing but a lord thou hast a lady far more beautiful than any woman in this waning age amen madam madam and nothing else so lords call ladies
