hilloa loa i have seen two such sights by sea and by land but i am not to say it is a sea for it is now the sky betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust a bodkin's point i would you did but see how it chafes how it rages how it takes up the shore but that's not to the point o the most piteous cry of the poor souls sometimes to see 'em and not to see 'em now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast and anon swallowed with yeast and froth as you'd thrust a cork into a hogshead and then for the land service to see how the bear tore out his shoulder bone how he cried to me for help and said his name was antigonus a nobleman but to make an end of the ship to see how the sea flap dragoned it but first how the poor souls roared and the sea mocked them and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mocked him both roaring louder than the sea or weather now now i have not winked since i saw these sights the men are not yet cold under water nor the bear half dined on the gentleman he's at it now i would you had been by the ship side to have helped her there your charity would have lacked footing you're a made old man if the sins of your youth are forgiven you you're well to live gold all gold go you the next way with your findings i'll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much he hath eaten they are never curst but when they are hungry if there be any of

fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk but i'll swear it and i would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands ay by any means prove a tall fellow if i do not wonder how thou dar'st venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow trust me not hark the kings and princes our kindred are going to see the queen's picture come follow us we'll be thy good masters
