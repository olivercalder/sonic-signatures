mars his true moving even as in the heavens so in the earth to this day is not known late did he shine upon the english side now we are victors upon us he smiles what towns of any moment but we have at pleasure here we lie near orleance otherwhiles the famished english like pale ghosts faintly besiege us one hour in a month sound sound alarum we will rush on them now for the honor of the forlorn french him i forgive my death that killeth me when he sees me go back one foot or fly whoever saw the like what men have i dogs cowards dastards i would ne'er have fled but that they left me 'midst my enemies let's leave this town for they are hare brained slaves and hunger will enforce them to be more eager of old i know them rather with their teeth the walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege bastard of orleance thrice welcome to us go call her in but first to try her skill reignier stand thou as dauphin in my place question her proudly let thy looks be stern by this means shall we sound what skill she hath thou hast astonished me with thy high terms only this proof i'll of thy valor make in single combat thou shalt buckle with me and if thou vanquishest thy words are true otherwise i renounce all confidence then come a' god's name i fear no woman stay stay thy hands thou art an amazon and fightest with the sword of deborah whoe'er helps thee 'tis thou that must help me impatiently i burn with thy desire my heart and hands thou hast at once subdued excellent pucelle if thy name be so let me thy servant and not sovereign be 'tis the french dauphin sueth to thee thus meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall what she says i'll confirm we'll fight it out was mahomet inspirèd with a dove thou with an eagle art inspirèd then helen the mother of great constantine nor yet saint philip's daughters were like thee bright star of venus fall'n down on the earth how may i reverently worship thee enough presently we'll try come let's away about it no prophet will i trust if she prove false divinest creature astraea's daughter how shall i honor thee for this success thy promises are like adonis' garden that one day bloomed and fruitful were the next france triumph in thy glorious prophetess recovered is the town of orleance more blessèd hap did ne'er befall our state 'tis joan not we by whom the day is won for which i will divide my crown with her and all the priests and friars in my realm shall in procession sing her endless praise a statelier pyramis to her i'll rear than rhodophe's of memphis ever was in memory of her when she is dead her ashes in an urn more precious than the rich jeweled coffer of darius transported shall be at high festivals before the kings and queens of france no longer on saint dennis will we cry but joan la pucelle shall be france's saint come in and let us banquet royally after this golden day of victory is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame didst thou at first to flatter us withal make us partakers of a little gain that now our loss might be ten times so much duke of alanson this was your default that being captain of the watch tonight did look no better to that weighty charge and for myself most part of all this night within her quarter and mine own precinct i was employed in passing to and fro about relieving of the sentinels then how or which way should they first break in saint dennis bless this happy stratagem and once again we'll sleep secure in roan now shine it like a comet of revenge a prophet to the fall of all our foes your grace may starve perhaps before that time we have been guided by thee hitherto and of thy cunning had no diffidence one sudden foil shall never breed distrust ay marry sweeting if we could do that france were no place for henry's warriors nor should that nation boast it so with us but be extirpèd from our provinces a parley with the duke of burgundy speak pucelle and enchant him with thy words welcome brave duke thy friendship makes us fresh now let us on my lords and join our powers and seek how we may prejudice the foe had york and somerset brought rescue in we should have found a bloody day of this o no forbear for that which we have fled during the life let us not wrong it dead on what submissive message art thou sent for prisoners askst thou hell our prison is but tell me whom thou seek'st go take their bodies hence so we be rid of them do with him what thou wilt and now to paris in this conquering vein all will be ours now bloody talbot's slain these news my lords may cheer our drooping spirits 'tis said the stout parisians do revolt and turn again unto the warlike french what tidings send our scouts i prithee speak somewhat too sudden sirs the warning is but we will presently provide for them then on my lords and france be fortunate since lords of england it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaimed in france we come to be informèd by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be 'tis known already that i am possessed with more than half the gallian territories and therein reverenced for their lawful king shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquished detract so much from that prerogative as to be called but viceroy of the whole no lord ambassador i'll rather keep that which i have than coveting for more be cast from possibility of all it shall only reserved you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrison
