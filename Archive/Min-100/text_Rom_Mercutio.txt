nay gentle romeo we must have you dance you are a lover borrow cupid's wings and soar with them above a common bound and to sink in it should you burden love  too great oppression for a tender thing if love be rough with you be rough with love prick love for pricking and you beat love down  give me a case to put my visage in  a visor for a visor what care i what curious eye doth cote deformities here are the beetle brows shall blush for me tut dun's the mouse the constable's own word if thou art dun we'll draw thee from the mire  or save your reverence love wherein thou stickest up to the ears come we burn daylight ho i mean sir in delay we waste our lights in vain light lights by day take our good meaning for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits why may one ask and so did i that dreamers often lie o then i see queen mab hath been with you she is the fairies' midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomi over men's noses as they lie asleep her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers her traces of the smallest spider web her collars of the moonshine's wat'ry beams her whip of cricket's bone the lash of film her wagoner a small gray coated gnat not half so big as a round little worm pricked from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazelnut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers' brains and then they dream of love on courtiers' knees that dream on cur'sies straight o'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees o'er ladies' lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithe pig's tail tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep then he dreams of another benefice sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades of healths five fathom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is she  true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who woos even now the frozen bosom of the north and being angered puffs away from thence turning his side to the dew dropping south he is wise and on my life hath stol'n him home to bed nay i'll conjure too romeo humors madman passion lover appear thou in the likeness of a sigh speak but one rhyme and i am satisfied cry but ay me pronounce but love and dove speak to my
