agamemnon how if he had boils full all over generally and those boils did run say so did not the general run then were not that a botchy core then there would come some matter from him i see none now the plague of greece upon thee thou mongrel beef witted lord i shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness but i think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book thou canst strike canst thou a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks dost thou think i have no sense thou strikest me thus thou art proclaimed a fool i think i would thou didst itch from head to foot and i had the scratching of thee i would make thee the loathsomest scab in greece when thou art forth in the incursions thou strikest as slow as another thou grumblest and railest every hour on achilles and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as cerberus is at proserpina's beauty ay that thou bark'st at him thou shouldst strike him  he would pound thee into shivers with his fist as a sailor breaks a biscuit do do ay do do thou sodden witted lord thou hast no more brain than i have in mine elbows an asinego may tutor thee thou scurvy valiant ass thou art here but to thrash trojans and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave if thou use to beat me i will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches thou thing of no bowels thou you scurvy lord mars his idiot do rudeness do camel do do you see him there do you nay look upon him nay but regard him well but yet you look not well upon him for whosomever you take him to be he is ajax ay but that fool knows not himself lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters his evasions have ears thus long i have bobbed his brain more than he has beat my bones i will buy nine sparrows for a penny and his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow this lord achilles ajax who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his head i'll tell you what i say of him i say this ajax  has not so much wit  as will stop the eye of helen's needle for whom he comes to fight i would have peace and quietness but the fool will not he there that he look you there no i warrant you the fool's will shame it i serve thee not i serve here voluntary e'en so a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews or else there be liars hector shall have a great catch an he knock out either of your brains he were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel there's ulysses and old nestor whose wit was moldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes yoke you like draft oxen and make you plow up the wars yes good sooth to achilles to ajax to  'tis no matter i shall speak as much as thou afterwards i will hold my peace when achilles' brach bids me shall i i will see you hanged like clodpolls ere i come any more to your tents i will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools how now thersites what lost in the labyrinth of thy fury shall the elephant ajax carry it thus he beats me and i rail at him o worthy satisfaction would it were otherwise that i could beat him whilst he railed at me 'sfoot i'll learn to conjure and raise devils but i'll see some issue of my spiteful execrations then there's achilles a rare enginer if troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves o thou great thunder darter of olympus forget that thou art jove the king of gods and mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if you take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have which short armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web after this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the neapolitan bone ache for that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket i have said my prayers and devil envy say amen what ho my lord achilles if i could 'a remembered a gilt counterfeit thou couldst not have slipped out of my contemplation but it is no matter thyself upon thyself the common curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in great revenue heaven bless thee from a tutor and discipline come not near thee let thy blood be thy direction till thy death then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse i'll be sworn and sworn upon 't she never shrouded any but lazars amen where's achilles ay the heavens hear me thy commander achilles then tell me patroclus what's achilles thy knower patroclus then tell me patroclus what art thou i'll decline the whole question agamemnon commands achilles achilles is my lord i am patroclus' knower and patroclus is a fool peace fool i have not done agamemnon is a fool achilles is a fool thersites is a fool and as aforesaid patroclus is a fool agamemnon is a fool to offer to command achilles achilles is a fool to be commanded of agamemnon thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and this patroclus is a fool positive make that demand of the creator it suffices me thou art look you who comes here here is such patchery such juggling and such knavery all the argument is a whore and a cuckold a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon now the dry serpigo on the subject and war and lechery confound all a wonder ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself he must fight singly tomorrow with hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgeling that he raves in saying nothing why he stalks up and down like a peacock  a stride and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say there were wit in this head an 'twould out and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking the man's undone forever for if hector break not his neck i' th' combat he'll break 't himself in vainglory he knows not me i said good morrow ajax and he replies thanks agamemnon what think you of this man that takes me for the general he's grown a very land fish languageless a monster a plague of opinion a man may wear it on both sides like a leather jerkin who i why he'll answer nobody he professes not answering speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue in 's arms i will put on his presence let patroclus make his demands to me you shall see the pageant of ajax hum ha hum agamemnon ha god b' wi' you with all my heart if tomorrow be a fair day by eleven of the clock it will go one way or other howsoever he shall pay for me ere he has me fare you well with all my heart no but he's out of tune thus what music will be in him when hector has knocked out his brains i know not but i am sure none unless the fiddler apollo get his sinews to make catlings on let me bear another to his horse for that's the more capable creature would the fountain of your mind were clear again that i might water an ass at it i had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance why thou picture of what thou seemest and idol of idiot worshippers here's a letter for thee why thou full dish of fool from troy the surgeon's box or the patient's wound prithee be silent boy i profit not by thy talk thou art said to be achilles' male varlet why his masculine whore now the rotten diseases of the south the guts griping ruptures catarrhs loads o' gravel in the back lethargies cold palsies raw eyes dirt rotten livers whissing lungs bladders full of impostume sciaticas limekilns i' th' palm incurable bone ache and the rivelled fee simple of the tetter take and take again such preposterous discoveries do i curse thee no why art thou then exasperate thou idle immaterial skein of sleave silk thou green sarsenet flap for a sore eye thou tassel of a prodigal's purse thou ah how the poor world is pestered with such waterflies diminutives of nature finch egg with too much blood and too little brain these two may run mad but if with too much brain and too little blood they do i'll be a curer of madmen here's agamemnon an honest fellow enough and one that loves quails but he has not so much brain as earwax and the goodly transformation of jupiter there his brother the bull the primitive statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds a thrifty shoeing horn in a chain hanging at his brother's leg to what form but that he is should wit larded with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to to an ass were nothing he is both ass and ox to an ox were nothing he is both ox and ass to be a dog a mule a cat a fitchew a toad a lizard an owl a puttock or a herring without a roe i would not care but to be menelaus i would conspire against destiny ask me not what i would be if i were not thersites for i care not to be the louse of a lazar so i were not menelaus heyday sprites and fires sweet draught sweet quoth he sweet sink sweet sewer that same diomed's a false hearted rogue a most unjust knave i will no more trust him when he leers than i will a serpent when he hisses he will spend his mouth and promise like brabbler the hound but when he performs astronomers foretell it it is prodigious there will come some change the sun borrows of the moon when diomed keeps his word i will rather leave to see hector than not to dog him they say he keeps a trojan drab and uses the traitor calchas his tent i'll after nothing but lechery all incontinent varlets and any man may sing her if he can take her clef she's noted roguery a juggling trick to be secretly open how the devil luxury with his fat rump and potato finger tickles these together fry lechery fry now the pledge now now now now she sharpens well said whetstone a proof of strength she could not publish more unless she said my mind is now turned whore will he swagger himself out on 's own eyes he'll tickle it for his concupy would i could meet that rogue diomed i would croak like a raven i would bode i would bode patroclus will give me anything for the intelligence of this whore the parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab lechery lechery still wars and lechery nothing else holds fashion a burning devil take them now they are clapper clawing one another i'll go look on that dissembling abominable varlet diomed has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's sleeve of troy there in his helm i would fain see them meet that that same young trojan ass that loves the whore there might send that greekish whoremasterly villain with the sleeve back to the dissembling luxurious drab of a sleeveless errand o' th' t'other side the policy of those crafty swearing rascals that stale old mouse eaten dry cheese nestor and that same dog fox ulysses is proved not worth a blackberry they set me up in policy that mongrel cur ajax against that dog of as bad a kind achilles and now is the cur ajax prouder than the cur achilles and will not arm today whereupon the grecians begin to proclaim barbarism and policy grows into an ill opinion soft here comes sleeve and t' other hold thy whore grecian now for thy whore trojan now the sleeve now the sleeve no no i am a rascal a scurvy railing knave a very filthy rogue god a mercy that thou wilt believe me but a plague break thy neck for frighting me what's become of the wenching rogues i think they have swallowed one another i would laugh at that miracle yet in a sort lechery eats itself i'll seek them the cuckold and the cuckold maker are at it now bull now dog loo paris loo now my double horned spartan loo paris loo the bull has the game ware horns ho what art thou i am a bastard too i love bastards i am bastard begot bastard instructed bastard in mind bastard in valor in everything illegitimate one bear will not bite another and wherefore should
