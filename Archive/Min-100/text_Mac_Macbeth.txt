so foul and fair a day i have not seen speak if you can what are you stay you imperfect speakers tell me more by sinel's death i know i am thane of glamis but how of cawdor the thane of cawdor lives a prosperous gentleman and to be king stands not within the prospect of belief no more than to be cawdor say from whence you owe this strange intelligence or why upon this blasted heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting speak i charge you into the air and what seemed corporal melted as breath into the wind would they had stayed your children shall be kings and thane of cawdor too went it not so the thane of cawdor lives why do you dress me in borrowed robes glamis and thane of cawdor the greatest is behind thanks for your pains do you not hope your children shall be kings when those that gave the thane of cawdor to me promised no less to them two truths are told as happy prologues to the swelling act of the imperial theme i thank you gentlemen this supernatural soliciting cannot be ill cannot be good if ill why hath it given me earnest of success commencing in a truth i am thane of cawdor if good why do i yield to that suggestion whose horrid image doth unfix my hair and make my seated heart knock at my ribs against the use of nature present fears are less than horrible imaginings my thought whose murder yet is but fantastical shakes so my single state of man that function is smothered in surmise and nothing is but what is not if chance will have me king why chance may crown me without my stir come what come may time and the hour runs through the roughest day give me your favor my dull brain was wrought with things forgotten kind gentlemen your pains are registered where every day i turn the leaf to read them let us toward the king think upon what hath chanced and at more time the interim having weighed it let us speak our free hearts each to other till then enough come friends the service and the loyalty i owe in doing it pays itself your highness' part is to receive our duties and our duties are to your throne and state children and servants which do but what they should by doing everything safe toward your love and honor the rest is labor which is not used for you i'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful the hearing of my wife with your approach so humbly take my leave the prince of cumberland that is a step on which i must fall down or else o'erleap for in my way it lies stars hide your fires let not light see my black and deep desires the eye wink at the hand yet let that be which the eye fears when it is done to see my dearest love duncan comes here tonight tomorrow as he purposes we will speak further if it were done when 'tis done then 'twere well it were done quickly if th' assassination could trammel up the consequence and catch with his surcease success that but this blow might be the be all and the end all here but here upon this bank and shoal of time we'd jump the life to come but in these cases we still have judgment here that we but teach bloody instructions which being taught return to plague th' inventor this even handed justice commends th' ingredience of our poisoned chalice to our own lips he's here in double trust first as i am his kinsman and his subject strong both against the deed then as his host who should against his murderer shut the door not bear the knife myself besides this duncan hath borne his faculties so meek hath been so clear in his great office that his virtues will plead like angels trumpet tongued against the deep damnation of his taking off and pity like a naked newborn babe striding the blast or heaven's cherubin horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air shall blow the horrid deed in every eye that tears shall drown the wind i have no spur to prick the sides of my intent but only vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself and falls on th' other  how now what news hath he asked for me we will proceed no further in this business he hath honored me of late and i have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people which would be worn now in their newest gloss not cast aside so soon prithee peace i dare do all that may become a man who dares do more is none if we should fail  bring forth men children only for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males will it not be received when we have marked with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers that they have done 't i am settled and bend up each corporal agent to this terrible feat away and mock the time with fairest show false face must hide what the false heart doth know a friend being unprepared our will became the servant to defect which else should free have wrought i think not of them yet when we can entreat an hour to serve we would spend it in some words upon that business if you would grant the time if you shall cleave to my consent when 'tis it shall make honor for you good repose the while go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready she strike upon the bell get thee to bed is this a dagger which i see before me the handle toward my hand come let me clutch thee i have thee not and yet i see thee still art thou not fatal vision sensible to feeling as to sight or art thou but a dagger of the mind a false creation proceeding from the heat oppressèd brain i see thee yet in form as palpable as this which now i draw thou marshal'st me the way that i was going and such an instrument i was to use mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses or else worth all the rest i see thee still and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood which was not so before there's no such thing it is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes now o'er the one half world nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse the curtained sleep witchcraft celebrates pale hecate's off'rings and withered murder alarumed by his sentinel the wolf whose howl's his watch thus with his stealthy pace with tarquin's ravishing strides towards his design moves like a ghost thou sure and firm set earth hear not my steps which way they walk for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabouts and take the present horror from the time which now suits with it whiles i threat he lives words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives i go and it is done the bell invites me hear it not duncan for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell who's there what ho i have done the deed didst thou not hear a noise when as i descended hark who lies i' th' second chamber this is a sorry sight there's one did laugh in 's sleep and one cried murder that they did wake each other i stood and heard them but they did say their prayers and addressed them again to sleep one cried god bless us and amen the other as they had seen me with these hangman's hands list'ning their fear i could not say amen when they did say god bless us but wherefore could not i pronounce amen i had most need of blessing and amen stuck in my throat methought i heard a voice cry sleep no more macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care the death of each day's life sore labor's bath balm of hurt minds great nature's second course chief nourisher in life's feast still it cried sleep no more to all the house glamis hath murdered sleep and therefore cawdor shall sleep no more macbeth shall sleep no more i'll go no more i am afraid to think what i have done look on 't again i dare not whence is that knocking how is 't with me when every noise appalls me what hands are here ha they pluck out mine eyes will all great neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand no this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine making the green one red to know my deed 'twere best not know myself wake duncan with thy knocking i would thou couldst good morrow both not yet i'll bring you to him the labor we delight in physics pain this is the door he does he did appoint so 'twas a rough night what's the matter what is 't you say the life had i but died an hour before this chance i had lived a blessèd time for from this instant there's nothing serious in mortality all is but toys renown and grace is dead the wine of life is drawn and the mere lees is left this vault to brag of you are and do not know 't the spring the head the fountain of your blood is stopped the very source of it is stopped o yet i do repent me of my fury that i did kill them who can be wise amazed temp'rate and furious loyal and neutral in a moment no man th' expedition of my violent love outrun the pauser reason here lay duncan his silver skin laced with his golden blood and his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature for ruin's wasteful entrance there the murderers steeped in the colors of their trade their daggers unmannerly breeched with gore who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make 's love known so all let's briefly put on manly readiness and meet i' th' hall together here's our chief guest tonight we hold a solemn supper sir and i'll request your presence ride you this afternoon we should have else desired your good advice which still hath been both grave and prosperous in this day's council but we'll take tomorrow is 't far you ride fail not our feast we hear our bloody cousins are bestowed in england and in ireland not confessing their cruel parricide filling their hearers with strange invention but of that tomorrow when therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly hie you to horse adieu till you return at night goes fleance with you i wish your horses swift and sure of foot and so i do commend you to their backs farewell let every man be master of his time till seven at night to make society the sweeter welcome we will keep ourself till suppertime alone while then god be with you sirrah a word with you attend those men our pleasure bring them before us to be thus is nothing but to be safely thus our fears in banquo stick deep and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be feared 'tis much he dares and to that dauntless temper of his mind he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor to act in safety there is none but he whose being i do fear and under him my genius is rebuked as it is said mark antony's was by caesar he chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me and bade them speak to him then prophet like they hailed him father to a line of kings upon my head they placed a fruitless crown and put a barren scepter in my grip thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand no son of mine succeeding if 't be so for banquo's issue have i filed my mind for them the gracious duncan have i murdered put rancors in the vessel of my peace only for them and mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man to make them kings the seeds of banquo kings rather than so come fate into the list and champion me to th' utterance who's there now go to the door and stay there till we call was it not yesterday we spoke together well then now have you considered of my speeches know that it was he in the times past which held you so under fortune which you thought had been our innocent self this i made good to you in our last conference passed in probation with you how you were borne in hand how crossed the instruments who wrought with them and all things else that might to half a soul and to a notion crazed say thus did banquo i did so and went further which is now our point of second meeting do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go are you so gospeled to pray for this good man and for his issue whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave and beggared yours forever ay in the catalogue you go for men as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs shoughs water rugs and demi wolves are clept all by the name of dogs the valued file distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle the housekeeper the hunter every one according to the gift which bounteous nature hath in him closed whereby he does receive particular addition from the bill that writes them all alike and so of men now if you have a station in the file not i' th' worst rank of manhood say 't and i will put that business in your bosoms whose execution takes your enemy off grapples you to the heart and love of us who wear our health but sickly in his life which in his death were perfect both of you know banquo was your enemy so is he mine and in such bloody distance that every minute of his being thrusts against my near'st of life and though i could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it yet i must not for certain friends that are both his and mine whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall who i myself struck down and thence it is that i to your assistance do make love masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons your spirits shine through you within this hour at most i will advise you where to plant yourselves acquaint you with the perfect spy o' th' time the moment on 't for 't must be done tonight and something from the palace always thought that i require a clearness and with him to leave no rubs nor botches in the work fleance his son that keeps him company whose absence is no less material to me than is his father's must embrace the fate of that dark hour resolve yourselves apart i'll come to you anon i'll call upon you straight abide within it is concluded banquo thy soul's flight if it find heaven must find it out tonight we have scorched the snake not killed it she'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth but let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly better be with the dead whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy duncan is in his grave after life's fitful fever he sleeps well treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison malice domestic foreign levy nothing can touch him further so shall i love and so i pray be you let your remembrance apply to banquo present him eminence both with eye and tongue unsafe the while that we must lave our honors in these flattering streams and make our faces vizards to our hearts disguising what they are o full of scorpions is my mind dear wife thou know'st that banquo and his fleance lives there's comfort yet they are assailable then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown his cloistered flight ere to black hecate's summons the shard born beetle with his drowsy hums hath rung night's yawning peal there shall be done a deed of dreadful note be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck till thou applaud the deed come seeling night scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day and with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale light thickens and the crow makes wing to th' rooky wood good things of day begin to droop and drowse whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse  thou marvel'st at my words but hold thee still things bad begun make strong themselves by ill so prithee go with me you know your own degrees sit down at first and last the hearty welcome ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host our hostess keeps her state but in best time we will require her welcome see they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks both sides are even here i'll sit i' th' midst be large in mirth anon we'll drink a measure the table round there's blood upon thy face 'tis better thee without than he within is he dispatched thou art the best o' th' cutthroats yet he's good that did the like for fleance if thou didst it thou art the nonpareil then comes my fit again i had else been perfect whole as the marble founded as the rock as broad and general as the casing air but now i am cabined cribbed confined bound in to saucy doubts and fears but banquo's safe thanks for that there the grown serpent lies the worm that's fled hath nature that in time will venom breed no teeth for th' present get thee gone tomorrow we'll hear ourselves again sweet remembrancer  now good digestion wait on appetite and health on both here had we now our country's honor roofed were the graced person of our banquo present who may i rather challenge for unkindness than pity for mischance the table's full where which of you have done this thou canst not say i did it never shake thy gory locks at me ay and a bold one that dare look on that which might appall the devil prithee see there behold look lo how say you why what care i if thou canst nod speak too  if charnel houses and our graves must send those that we bury back our monuments shall be the maws of kites if i stand here i saw him blood hath been shed ere now i' th' olden time ere humane statute purged the gentle weal ay and since too murders have been performed too terrible for the ear the time has been that when the brains were out the man would die and there an end but now they rise again with twenty mortal murders on their crowns and push us from our stools this is more strange than such a murder is i do forget  do not muse at me my most worthy friends i have a strange infirmity which is nothing to those that know me come love and health to all then i'll sit down give me some wine fill full i drink to th' general joy o' th' whole table and to our dear friend banquo whom we miss would he were here to all and him we thirst and all to all avaunt and quit my sight let the earth hide thee thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with what man dare i dare approach thou like the rugged russian bear the armed rhinoceros or th' hyrcan tiger take any shape but that and my firm nerves shall never tremble or be alive again and dare me to the desert with thy sword if trembling i inhabit then protest me the baby of a girl hence horrible shadow unreal mock'ry hence why so being gone i am a man again pray you sit still can such things be and overcome us like a summer's cloud without our special wonder you make me strange even to the disposition that i owe when now i think you can behold such sights and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks when mine is blanched with fear it will have blood they say blood will have blood stones have been known to move and trees to speak augurs and understood relations have by maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth the secret'st man of blood what is the night how say'st thou that macduff denies his person at our great bidding i hear it by the way but i will send there's not a one of them but in his house i keep a servant fee'd i will tomorrow and betimes i will to the weïrd sisters more shall they speak for now i am bent to know by the worst means the worst for mine own good all causes shall give way i am in blood stepped in so far that should i wade no more returning were as tedious as go o'er strange things i have in head that will to hand which must be acted ere they may be scanned come we'll to sleep my strange and self abuse is the initiate fear that wants hard use we are yet but young in deed how now you secret black and midnight hags what is 't you do i conjure you by that which you profess howe'er you come to know it answer me though you untie the winds and let them fight against the churches though the yeasty waves confound and swallow navigation up though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down though castles topple on their warders' heads though palaces and pyramids do slope their heads to their foundations though the treasure of nature's germens tumble all together even till destruction sicken answer me to what i ask you call 'em let me see 'em tell me thou unknown power  whate'er thou art for thy good caution thanks thou hast harped my fear aright but one word more  had i three ears i'd hear thee then live macduff what need i fear of thee but yet i'll make assurance double sure and take a bond of fate thou shalt not live that i may tell pale hearted fear it lies and sleep in spite of thunder what is this that rises like the issue of a king and wears upon his baby brow the round and top of sovereignty that will never be who can impress the forest bid the tree unfix his earthbound root sweet bodements good rebellious dead rise never till the wood of birnam rise and our high placed macbeth shall live the lease of nature pay his breath to time and mortal custom yet my heart throbs to know one thing tell me if your art can tell so much shall banquo's issue ever reign in this kingdom i will be satisfied deny me this and an eternal curse fall on you let me know why sinks that cauldron and what noise is this thou art too like the spirit of banquo down thy crown does sear mine eyeballs and thy hair thou other gold bound brow is like the first a third is like the former filthy hags why do you show me this a fourth start eyes what will the line stretch out to th' crack of doom another yet a seventh i'll see no more and yet the eighth appears who bears a glass which shows me many more and some i see that twofold balls and treble scepters carry horrible sight now i see 'tis true for the blood boltered banquo smiles upon me and points at them for his what is this so where are they gone let this pernicious hour stand aye accursèd in the calendar  come in without there saw you the weïrd sisters came they not by you infected be the air whereon they ride and damned all those that trust them i did hear the galloping of horse who was 't came by fled to england time thou anticipat'st my dread exploits the flighty purpose never is o'ertook unless the deed go with it from this moment the very firstlings of my heart shall be the firstlings of my hand and even now to crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done the castle of macduff i will surprise seize upon fife give to th' edge o' th' sword his wife his babes and all unfortunate souls that trace him in his line no boasting like a fool this deed i'll do before this purpose cool but no more sights where are these gentlemen come bring me where they are bring me no more reports let them fly all till birnam wood remove to dunsinane i cannot taint with fear what's the boy malcolm was he not born of woman the spirits that know all mortal consequences have pronounced me thus fear not macbeth no man that's born of woman shall e'er have power upon thee then fly false thanes and mingle with the english epicures the mind i sway by and the heart i bear shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear the devil damn thee black thou cream faced loon where got'st thou that goose look geese villain go prick thy face and over red thy fear thou lily livered boy what soldiers patch death of thy soul those linen cheeks of thine are counselors to fear what soldiers whey face take thy face hence seyton i am sick at heart when i behold seyton i say this push will cheer me ever or disseat me now i have lived long enough my way of life is fall'n into the sere the yellow leaf and that which should accompany old age as honor love obedience troops of friends i must not look to have but in their stead curses not loud but deep mouth honor breath which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not  seyton what news more i'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked give me my armor i'll put it on send out more horses skirr the country round hang those that talk of fear give me mine armor  how does your patient doctor cure her of that canst thou not minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart throw physic to the dogs i'll none of it  come put mine armor on give me my staff seyton send out doctor the thanes fly from me  come sir dispatch if thou couldst doctor cast the water of my land find her disease and purge it to a sound and pristine health i would applaud thee to the very echo that should applaud again pull 't off i say  what rhubarb senna or what purgative drug would scour these english hence hear'st thou of them bring it after me  i will not be afraid of death and bane till birnam forest come to dunsinane hang out our banners on the outward walls the cry is still they come our castle's strength will laugh a siege to scorn here let them lie till famine and the ague eat them up were they not forced with those that should be ours we might have met them dareful beard to beard and beat them backward home what is that noise i have almost forgot the taste of fears the time has been my senses would have cooled to hear a night shriek and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in 't i have supped full with horrors direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts cannot once start me wherefore was that cry she should have died hereafter there would have been a time for such a word tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death out out brief candle life's but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing thou com'st to use thy tongue thy story quickly well say sir liar and slave if thou speak'st false upon the next tree shall thou hang alive till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth i care not if thou dost for me as much  i pull in resolution and begin to doubt th' equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth fear not till birnam wood do come to dunsinane and now a wood comes toward dunsinane arm arm and out  if this which he avouches does appear there is nor flying hence nor tarrying here i 'gin to be aweary of the sun and wish th' estate o' th' world were now undone  ring the alarum bell blow wind come wrack at least we'll die with harness on our back they have tied me to a stake i cannot fly but bear like i must fight the course what's he that was not born of woman such a one am i to fear or none thou 'lt be afraid to hear it my name's macbeth no nor more fearful thou wast born of woman but swords i smile at weapons laugh to scorn brandished by man that's of a woman born why should i play the roman fool and die on mine own sword whiles i see lives the gashes do better upon them of all men else i have avoided thee but get thee back my soul is too much charged with blood of thine already thou losest labor as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests i bear a charmèd life which must not yield to one of woman born accursèd be that tongue that tells me so for it hath cowed my better part of man and be these juggling fiends no more believed that palter with us in a double sense that keep the word of promise to our ear and break it to our hope i'll not fight with thee i will not yield to kiss the ground before young malcolm's feet and to be baited with the rabble's curse though birnam wood be come to dunsinane and thou opposed being of no woman born yet i will try the last before my body i throw my warlike shield lay on macduff and damned be him that first cries hold enough
