thus have you heard our cause and known our means and my most noble friends i pray you all speak plainly your opinions of our hopes and first lord marshal what say you to it 'tis very true lord bardolph for indeed it was young hotspur's cause at shrewsbury that he should draw his several strengths together and come against us in full puissance need not to be dreaded let us on and publish the occasion of our arms the commonwealth is sick of their own choice their over greedy love hath surfeited an habitation giddy and unsure hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart o thou fond many with what loud applause didst thou beat heaven with blessing bolingbroke before he was what thou wouldst have him be and being now trimmed in thine own desires thou beastly feeder art so full of him that thou provok'st thyself to cast him up so so thou common dog didst thou disgorge thy glutton bosom of the royal richard and now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up and howl'st to find it what trust is in these times they that when richard lived would have him die are now become enamored on his grave thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head when through proud london he came sighing on after th' admir√®d heels of bolingbroke criest now o earth yield us that king again and take thou this o thoughts of men accursed past and to come seems best things present worst what is this forest called here stand my lords and send discoverers forth to know the numbers of our enemies 'tis well done my friends and brethren in these great affairs i must acquaint you that i have received new dated letters from northumberland their cold intent tenor and substance thus here doth he wish his person with such powers as might hold sortance with his quality the which he could not levy whereupon he is retired to ripe his growing fortunes to scotland and concludes in hearty prayers that your attempts may overlive the hazard and fearful meeting of their opposite what well appointed leader fronts us here say on my lord of westmoreland in peace what doth concern your coming wherefore do i this so the question stands briefly to this end we are all diseased and with our surfeiting and wanton hours have brought ourselves into a burning fever and we must bleed for it of which disease our late king richard being infected died but my most noble lord of westmoreland i take not on me here as a physician nor do i as an enemy to peace troop in the throngs of military men but rather show awhile like fearful war to diet rank minds sick of happiness and purge th' obstructions which begin to stop our very veins of life hear me more plainly i have in equal balance justly weighed what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer and find our griefs heavier than our offenses we see which way the stream of time doth run and are enforced from our most quiet there by the rough torrent of occasion and have the summary of all our griefs when time shall serve to show in articles which long ere this we offered to the king and might by no suit gain our audience when we are wronged and would unfold our griefs we are denied access unto his person even by those men that most have done us wrong the dangers of the days but newly gone whose memory is written on the earth with yet appearing blood and the examples of every minute's instance present now hath put us in these ill beseeming arms not to break peace or any branch of it but to establish here a peace indeed concurring both in name and quality my brother general the commonwealth to brother born an household cruelty i make my quarrel in particular then take my lord of westmoreland this schedule for this contains our general grievances each several article herein redressed all members of our cause both here and hence that are insinewed to this action acquitted by a true substantial form and present execution of our wills to us and to our purposes confined we come within our awful banks again and knit our powers to the arm of peace my lord we will do so no no my lord note this the king is weary of dainty and such picking grievances for he hath found to end one doubt by death revives two greater in the heirs of life and therefore will he wipe his tables clean and keep no telltale to his memory that may repeat and history his loss to new remembrance for full well he knows he cannot so precisely weed this land as his misdoubts present occasion his foes are so enrooted with his friends that plucking to unfix an enemy he doth unfasten so and shake a friend so that this land like an offensive wife that hath enraged him on to offer strokes as he is striking holds his infant up and hangs resolved correction in the arm that was upreared to execution 'tis very true and therefore be assured my good lord marshal if we do now make our atonement well our peace will like a broken limb united grow stronger for the breaking before and greet his grace my lord we come good my lord of lancaster i am not here against your father's peace but as i told my lord of westmoreland the time misordered doth in common sense crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form to hold our safety up i sent your grace the parcels and particulars of our grief the which hath been with scorn shoved from the court whereon this hydra son of war is born whose dangerous eyes may well be charmed asleep with grant of our most just and right desires and true obedience of this madness cured stoop tamely to the foot of majesty i take your princely word for these redresses to you my noble lord of westmoreland i do not doubt you against ill chances men are ever merry but heaviness foreruns the good event believe me i am passing light in spirit a peace is of the nature of a conquest for then both parties nobly are subdued and neither party loser go good lord hastings and ere they be dismissed let them march by will you thus break your faith
