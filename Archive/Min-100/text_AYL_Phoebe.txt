i would not be thy executioner i fly thee for i would not injure thee thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye 'tis pretty sure and very probable that eyes that are the frail'st and softest things who shut their coward gates on atomies should be called tyrants butchers murderers now i do frown on thee with all my heart and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down or if thou canst not o for shame for shame lie not to say mine eyes are murderers now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee scratch thee but with a pin and there remains some scar of it lean upon a rush the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes which i have darted at thee hurt thee not nor i am sure there is no force in eyes that can do hurt but till that time come not thou near me and when that time comes afflict me with thy mocks pity me not as till that time i shall not pity thee sweet youth i pray you chide a year together i had rather hear you chide than this man woo for no ill will i bear you dead shepherd now i find thy saw of might who ever loved that loved not at first sight ha what sayst thou silvius why i am sorry for thee gentle silvius thou hast my love is not that neighborly why that were covetousness silvius the time was that i hated thee and yet it is not that i bear thee love but since that thou canst talk of love so well thy company which erst was irksome to me i will endure and i'll employ thee too but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employed know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile think not i love him though i ask for him 'tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well  but what care i for words yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear it is a pretty youth not very pretty  but sure he's proud and yet his pride becomes him he'll make a proper man the best thing in him is his complexion and faster than his tongue did make offense his eye did heal it up he is not very tall yet for his years he's tall his leg is but so so and yet 'tis well there was a pretty redness in his lip a little riper and more lusty red than that mixed in his cheek 'twas just the difference betwixt the constant red and mingled damask there be some women silvius had they marked him in parcels as i did would have gone near to fall in love with him but for my part i love him not nor hate him not and yet i have more cause to hate him than to love him for what had he to do to chide at me he said mine eyes were black and my hair black and now i am remembered scorned at me i marvel why i answered not again but that's all one omittance is no quittance i'll write to him a very taunting letter and thou shalt bear it wilt thou silvius i'll write it straight the matter's in my head and in my heart i will be bitter with him and passing short go with me silvius youth you have done me much ungentleness to show the letter that i writ to you good shepherd tell this youth what 'tis to love and i for ganymede and i for ganymede and so am i for ganymede if this be so why blame you me to love you nor i that will i should i die the hour after so is the bargain if sight and shape be true why then my love adieu i will not eat my word now thou art mine thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine
