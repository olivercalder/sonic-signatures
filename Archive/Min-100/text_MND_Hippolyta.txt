four days will quickly steep themselves in night four nights will quickly dream away the time and then the moon like to a silver bow bent in heaven shall behold the night of our solemnities i was with hercules and cadmus once when in a wood of crete they bayed the bear with hounds of sparta never did i hear such gallant chiding for besides the groves the skies the fountains every region near seemed all one mutual cry i never heard so musical a discord such sweet thunder 'tis strange my theseus that these lovers speak of but all the story of the night told over and all their minds transfigured so together more witnesseth than fancy's images and grows to something of great constancy but howsoever strange and admirable i love not to see wretchedness o'ercharged and duty in his service perishing he says they can do nothing in this kind indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard it must be your imagination then and not theirs i am aweary of this moon would he would change well shone moon truly the moon shines with a good grace beshrew my heart but i pity the man how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus i hope she will be brief
