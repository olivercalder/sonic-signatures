o corin that thou knew'st how i do love her no corin being old thou canst not guess though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover as ever sighed upon a midnight pillow but if thy love were ever like to mine  as sure i think did never man love so  how many actions most ridiculous hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy o thou didst then never love so heartily if thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly that ever love did make thee run into thou hast not loved or if thou hast not sat as i do now wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise thou hast not loved or if thou hast not broke from company abruptly as my passion now makes me thou hast not loved o phoebe phoebe phoebe sweet phoebe do not scorn me do not phoebe say that you love me not but say not so in bitterness the common executioner whose heart th' accustomed sight of death makes hard falls not the axe upon the humbled neck but first begs pardon will you sterner be than he that dies and lives by bloody drops o dear phoebe if ever as that ever may be near  you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy then shall you know the wounds invisible that love's keen arrows make sweet phoebe  sweet phoebe pity me wherever sorrow is relief would be if you do sorrow at my grief in love by giving love your sorrow and my grief were both extermined i would have you so holy and so perfect is my love and i in such a poverty of grace that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps loose now and then a scattered smile and that i'll live upon not very well but i have met him oft and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of phoebe with all my heart my errand is to you fair youth my gentle phoebe did bid me give you this i know not the contents but as i guess by the stern brow and waspish action which she did use as she was writing of it it bears an angry tenor pardon me i am but as a guiltless messenger no i protest i know not the contents phoebe did write it sure it is hers so please you for i never heard it yet yet heard too much of phoebe's cruelty call you this railing call you this chiding it is to be all made of sighs and tears and so am i for phoebe it is to be all made of faith and service and so am i for phoebe it is to be all made of fantasy all made of passion and all made of wishes all adoration duty and observance all humbleness all patience and impatience all purity all trial all observance and so am i for phoebe if this be so why blame you me to love you i'll not fail if i live though to have her and death were both one thing
