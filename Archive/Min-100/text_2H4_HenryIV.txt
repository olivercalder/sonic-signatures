go call the earls of surrey and of warwick but ere they come bid them o'erread these letters and well consider of them make good speed how many thousand of my poorest subjects are at this hour asleep o sleep o gentle sleep nature's soft nurse how have i frighted thee that thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down and steep my senses in forgetfulness why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs upon uneasy pallets stretching thee and hushed with buzzing night flies to thy slumber than in the perfumed chambers of the great under the canopies of costly state and lulled with sound of sweetest melody o thou dull god why liest thou with the vile in loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch a watch case or a common 'larum bell wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast seal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains in cradle of the rude imperious surge and in the visitation of the winds who take the ruffian billows by the top curling their monstrous heads and hanging them with deafing clamor in the slippery clouds that with the hurly death itself awakes canst thou o partial sleep give thy repose to the wet sea boy in an hour so rude and in the calmest and most stillest night with all appliances and means to boot deny it to a king then happy low lie down uneasy lies the head that wears a crown is it good morrow lords why then good morrow to you all my lords have you read o'er the letter that i sent you then you perceive the body of our kingdom how foul it is what rank diseases grow and with what danger near the heart of it o god that one might read the book of fate and see the revolution of the times make mountains level and the continent weary of solid firmness melt itself into the sea and other times to see the beachy girdle of the ocean too wide for neptune's hips how chance's mocks and changes fill the cup of alteration with divers liquors o if this were seen the happiest youth viewing his progress through what perils past what crosses to ensue would shut the book and sit him down and die 'tis not ten years gone since richard and northumberland great friends did feast together and in two years after were they at wars it is but eight years since this percy was the man nearest my soul who like a brother toiled in my affairs and laid his love and life under my foot yea for my sake even to the eyes of richard gave him defiance but which of you was by  you cousin nevil as i may remember  when richard with his eye brimful of tears then checked and rated by northumberland did speak these words now proved a prophecy northumberland thou ladder by the which my cousin bolingbroke ascends my throne  though then god knows i had no such intent but that necessity so bowed the state that i and greatness were compelled to kiss  the time shall come thus did he follow it the time will come that foul sin gathering head shall break into corruption so went on foretelling this same time's condition and the division of our amity are these things then necessities then let us meet them like necessities and that same word even now cries out on us they say the bishop and northumberland are fifty thousand strong i will take your counsel and were these inward wars once out of hand we would dear lords unto the holy land now lords if god doth give successful end to this debate that bleedeth at our doors we will our youth lead on to higher fields and draw no swords but what are sanctified our navy is addressed our power collected our substitutes in absence well invested and everything lies level to our wish only we want a little personal strength and pause us till these rebels now afoot come underneath the yoke of government humphrey my son of gloucester where is the prince your brother and how accompanied is not his brother thomas of clarence with him nothing but well to thee thomas of clarence how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother he loves thee and thou dost neglect him thomas thou hast a better place in his affection than all thy brothers cherish it my boy and noble offices thou mayst effect of mediation after i am dead between his greatness and thy other brethren therefore omit him not blunt not his love nor lose the good advantage of his grace by seeming cold or careless of his will for he is gracious if he be observed he hath a tear for pity and a hand open as day for melting charity yet notwithstanding being incensed he is flint as humorous as winter and as sudden as flaws congealèd in the spring of day his temper therefore must be well observed chide him for faults and do it reverently when you perceive his blood inclined to mirth but being moody give him time and scope till that his passions like a whale on ground confound themselves with working learn this thomas and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in that the united vessel of their blood mingled with venom of suggestion as force perforce the age will pour it in shall never leak though it do work as strong as aconitum or rash gunpowder why art thou not at windsor with him thomas and how accompanied canst thou tell that most subject is the fattest soil to weeds and he the noble image of my youth is overspread with them therefore my grief stretches itself beyond the hour of death the blood weeps from my heart when i do shape in forms imaginary th' unguided days and rotten times that you shall look upon when i am sleeping with my ancestors for when his headstrong riot hath no curb when rage and hot blood are his counsellors when means and lavish manners meet together o with what wings shall his affections fly towards fronting peril and opposed decay 'tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb in the dead carrion who's here westmoreland o westmoreland thou art a summer bird which ever in the haunch of winter sings the lifting up of day look here's more news and wherefore should these good news make me sick will fortune never come with both hands full but write her fair words still in foulest letters she either gives a stomach and no food  such are the poor in health or else a feast and takes away the stomach such are the rich that have abundance and enjoy it not i should rejoice now at this happy news and now my sight fails and my brain is giddy o me come near me now i am much ill i pray you take me up and bear me hence into some other chamber softly pray let there be no noise made my gentle friends unless some dull and favorable hand will whisper music to my weary spirit set me the crown upon my pillow here warwick gloucester clarence why did you leave me here alone my lords the prince of wales where is he let me see him he is not here where is the crown who took it from my pillow the prince hath ta'en it hence go seek him out is he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my death find him my lord of warwick chide him hither this part of his conjoins with my disease and helps to end me see sons what things you are how quickly nature falls into revolt when gold becomes her object for this the foolish overcareful fathers have broke their sleep with thoughts their brains with care their bones with industry for this they have engrossèd and piled up the cankered heaps of strange achievèd gold for this they have been thoughtful to invest their sons with arts and martial exercises  when like the bee tolling from every flower the virtuous sweets our thighs packed with wax our mouths with honey we bring it to the hive and like the bees are murdered for our pains this bitter taste yields his engrossments to the ending father now where is he that will not stay so long till his friend sickness hath determined me but wherefore did he take away the crown lo where he comes come hither to me harry  depart the chamber leave us here alone thy wish was father harry to that thought i stay too long by thee i weary thee dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair that thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors before thy hour be ripe o foolish youth thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee stay but a little for my cloud of dignity is held from falling with so weak a wind that it will quickly drop my day is dim thou hast stol'n that which after some few hours were thine without offense and at my death thou hast sealed up my expectation thy life did manifest thou loved'st me not and thou wilt have me die assured of it thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts whom thou hast whetted on thy stony heart to stab at half an hour of my life what canst thou not forbear me half an hour then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear that thou art crownèd not that i am dead let all the tears that should bedew my hearse be drops of balm to sanctify thy head only compound me with forgotten dust give that which gave thee life unto the worms pluck down my officers break my decrees for now a time is come to mock at form harry the fifth is crowned up vanity down royal state all you sage councillors hence and to the english court assemble now from every region apes of idleness now neighbor confines purge you of your scum have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance revel the night rob murder and commit the oldest sins the newest kind of ways be happy he will trouble you no more england shall double gild his treble guilt england shall give him office honor might for the fifth harry from curbed license plucks the muzzle of restraint and the wild dog shall flesh his tooth on every innocent o my poor kingdom sick with civil blows when that my care could not withhold thy riots what wilt thou do when riot is thy care o thou wilt be a wilderness again peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants o my son god put it in thy mind to take it hence that thou mightst win the more thy father's love pleading so wisely in excuse of it come hither harry sit thou by my bed and hear i think the very latest counsel that ever i shall breathe god knows my son by what bypaths and indirect crook'd ways i met this crown and i myself know well how troublesome it sat upon my head to thee it shall descend with better quiet better opinion better confirmation for all the soil of the achievement goes with me into the earth it seemed in me but as an honor snatched with boist'rous hand and i had many living to upbraid my gain of it by their assistances which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed wounding supposèd peace all these bold fears thou seest with peril i have answerèd for all my reign hath been but as a scene acting that argument and now my death changes the mood for what in me was purchased falls upon thee in a more fairer sort so thou the garland wear'st successively yet though thou stand'st more sure than i could do thou art not firm enough since griefs are green and all my friends which thou must make thy friends have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out by whose fell working i was first advanced and by whose power i well might lodge a fear to be again displaced which to avoid i cut them off and had a purpose now to lead out many to the holy land lest rest and lying still might make them look too near unto my state therefore my harry be it thy course to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels that action hence borne out may waste the memory of the former days more would i but my lungs are wasted so that strength of speech is utterly denied me how i came by the crown o god forgive and grant it may with thee in true peace live look look here comes my john of lancaster thou bring'st me happiness and peace son john but health alack with youthful wings is flown from this bare withered trunk upon thy sight my worldly business makes a period where is my lord of warwick doth any name particular belong unto the lodging where i first did swoon laud be to god even there my life must end it hath been prophesied to me many years i should not die but in jerusalem which vainly i supposed the holy land but bear me to that chamber there i'll lie in that jerusalem shall harry die
