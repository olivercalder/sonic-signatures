mistress you must come away to your father no by mine honor but i was bid to come for you of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes and swore by his honor the mustard was naught now i'll stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forsworn stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave by my knavery if i had it then i were but if you swear by that that is not you are not forsworn no more was this knight swearing by his honor for he never had any or if he had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard one that old frederick your father loves the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly or as the destinies decrees nay if i keep not my rank  but what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies i care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary for my part i had rather bear with you than bear you yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you for i think you have no money in your purse ay now am i in arden the more fool i when i was at home i was in a better place but travelers must be content and i mine i remember when i was in love i broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a night to jane smile and i remember the kissing of her batler and the cow's dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked and i remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom i took two cods and giving her them again said with weeping tears wear these for my sake we that are true lovers run into strange capers but as all is mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly nay i shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till i break my shins against it and mine but it grows something stale with me holla you clown your betters sir truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherd's life it is naught in respect that it is solitary i like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious as it is a spare life look you it fits my humor well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach hast any philosophy in thee shepherd such a one is a natural philosopher wast ever in court shepherd then thou art damned truly thou art damned like an ill roasted egg all on one side why if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good manners if thou never saw'st good manners then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation thou art in a parlous state shepherd instance briefly come instance why do not your courtier's hands sweat and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man shallow shallow a better instance i say come your lips will feel them the sooner shallow again a more sounder instance come most shallow man thou worms' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed learn of the wise and perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the very uncleanly flux of a cat mend the instance shepherd wilt thou rest damned god help thee shallow man god make incision in thee thou art raw that is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bell wether and to betray a she lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked pated old cuckoldly ram out of all reasonable match if thou be'st not damned for this the devil himself will have no shepherds i cannot see else how thou shouldst 'scape i'll rhyme you so eight years together dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted it is the right butter women's rank to market for a taste if a hart do lack a hind let him seek out rosalind if the cat will after kind so be sure will rosalind wintered garments must be lined so must slender rosalind they that reap must sheaf and bind then to cart with rosalind sweetest nut hath sourest rind such a nut is rosalind he that sweetest rose will find must find love's prick and rosalind this is the very false gallop of verses why do you infect yourself with them truly the tree yields bad fruit you have said but whether wisely or no let the forest judge come shepherd let us make an honorable retreat though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage come apace good audrey i will fetch up your goats audrey and how audrey am i the man yet doth my simple feature content you i am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet honest ovid was among the goths when a man's verses cannot be understood nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room truly i would the gods had made thee poetical no truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign i do truly for thou swear'st to me thou art honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some hope thou didst feign no truly unless thou wert hard favored for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish well praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter but be it as it may be i will marry thee and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext the vicar of the next village who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us amen a man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but horn beasts but what though courage as horns are odious they are necessary it is said many a man knows no end of his goods right many a man has good horns and knows no end of them well that is the dowry of his wife 'tis none of his own getting horns even so poor men alone no no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man therefore blessed no as a walled town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defense is better than no skill by so much is a horn more precious than to want here comes sir oliver sir oliver martext you are well met will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel i will not take her on gift of any man good even

think he is wise but the wise man knows himself to be a fool the heathen philosopher when he had a desire to eat a grape would open his lips when he put it into his mouth meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open you do love this maid give me your hand art thou learned then learn this of me to have is to have for it is a figure in rhetoric that drink being poured out of a cup into a glass by filling the one doth empty the other for all your writers do consent that ipse is he now you are not ipse for i am he he sir that must marry this woman therefore you clown abandon

quarrel was upon the seventh cause god 'ild you sir i desire you of the like i press in here sir amongst the rest of the country copulatives to swear and to forswear according as marriage binds and blood breaks a poor virgin sir an ill favored thing sir but mine own a poor humor of mine sir to take that that no man else will rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster according to the fool's bolt sir and such dulcet diseases upon a lie seven times removed bear your body more seeming audrey as thus sir i did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard he sent me word if i said his beard was not cut well he was in the mind it was this is called the retort courteous if i sent him word again it was not well cut he would send me word he cut it to please himself this is called the quip modest if again it was not well cut he disabled my judgment this is called the reply churlish if again it was not well cut he would answer i spake not true this is called the reproof valiant if again it was not well cut he would say i lie this is called the countercheck quarrelsome and so to the lie circumstantial and the lie direct i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial nor he durst not give me the lie direct and so we measured swords and parted o sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have books for good manners i will name you the degrees the first the retort courteous the second the quip modest the third the reply churlish the fourth the reproof valiant the fifth the countercheck quarrelsome the sixth the lie with circumstance the seventh the lie direct all these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may avoid that too with an if i knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel but when the parties were met themselves one of them thought but of an if as if you said so then i said so and they shook hands and swore brothers your if is the only peacemaker much virtue in if
