to escape that followed me so near o our lives' sweetness that we the pain of death would hourly die rather than die at once taught me to shift into a madman's rags t' assume a semblance that very dogs disdained and in this habit met i my father with his bleeding rings their precious stones new lost became his guide led him begged for him saved him from despair never o fault revealed myself unto him until some half hour past when i was armed not sure though hoping of this good success i asked his blessing and from first to last told him our pilgrimage but his flawed heart alack too weak the conflict to support 'twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief burst smilingly this would have seemed a period to such as love not sorrow but another to amplify too much would make much more and top extremity whilst i was big in clamor came there in a man who having seen me in my worst estate shunned my abhorred society but then finding who 'twas that so endured with his strong arms he fastened on my neck and bellowed out as he'd burst heaven threw him on my father told the most piteous tale of lear and him that ever ear received which in recounting his grief grew puissant and the strings of life began to crack twice then the trumpets sounded and there i left him tranced kent sir the banished kent who in disguise followed his enemy king and did him service improper for a slave what kind of help what means this bloody knife here comes kent to who my lord who has the office send thy token of reprieve haste thee for thy life or image of that horror 'tis noble kent your friend very bootless he faints my lord my lord look up my lord he is gone indeed the weight of this sad time we must obey speak what we feel not what we ought to say the oldest hath borne most we that are young shall never see so much nor live so long
