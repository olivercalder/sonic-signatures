o well did he become that lion's robe that did disrobe the lion of that robe my uncle's will in this respect is mine if he see aught in you that makes him like that anything he sees which moves his liking i can with ease translate it to my will or if you will to speak more properly i will enforce it eas'ly to my love further i will not flatter you my lord that all i see in you is worthy love than this that nothing do i see in you though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge that i can find should merit any hate that she is bound in honor still to do what you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say that's the curse of rome the lady constance speaks not from her faith but from her need upon thy wedding day against the blood that thou hast marrièd what shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums clamors of hell be measures to our pomp o husband hear me ay alack how new is husband in my mouth even for that name which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce upon my knee i beg go not to arms against mine uncle now shall i see thy love what motive may be stronger with thee than the name of wife the sun's o'ercast with blood fair day adieu which is the side that i must go withal i am with both each army hath a hand and in their rage i having hold of both they whirl asunder and dismember me husband i cannot pray that thou mayst win  uncle i needs must pray that thou mayst lose  father i may not wish the fortune thine  grandam i will not wish thy wishes thrive whoever wins on that side shall i lose assurèd loss before the match be played there where my fortune lives there my life dies
