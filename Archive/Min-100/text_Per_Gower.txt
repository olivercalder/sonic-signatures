to sing a song that old was sung from ashes ancient gower is come assuming man's infirmities to glad your ear and please your eyes it hath been sung at festivals on ember eves and holy days and lords and ladies in their lives have read it for restoratives the purchase is to make men glorious et bonum quo antiquius eo melius if you born in these latter times when wit's more ripe accept my rhymes and that to hear an old man sing may to your wishes pleasure bring i life would wish and that i might waste it for you like taper light this antioch then antiochus the great built up this city for his chiefest seat the fairest in all syria i tell you what mine authors say this king unto him took a peer who died and left a female heir so buxom blithe and full of face as heaven had lent her all his grace with whom the father liking took and her to incest did provoke bad child worse father to entice his own to evil should be done by none but custom what they did begin was with long use accounted no sin the beauty of this sinful dame made many princes thither frame to seek her as a bedfellow in marriage pleasures playfellow which to prevent he made a law to keep her still and men in awe that whoso asked her for his wife his riddle told not lost his life so for her many a wight did die as yon grim looks do testify what now ensues to the judgment of your eye i give my cause who best can justify here have you seen a mighty king his child iwis to incest bring a better prince and benign lord that will prove awful both in deed and word be quiet then as men should be till he hath passed necessity i'll show you those in troubles reign losing a mite a mountain gain the good in conversation to whom i give my benison is still at tarsus where each man thinks all is writ he speken can and to remember what he does build his statue to make him glorious but tidings to the contrary are brought your eyes what need speak i good helicane that stayed at home  not to eat honey like a drone from others' labors for though he strive to killen bad keep good alive and to fulfill his prince' desire  sends word of all that haps in tyre how thaliard came full bent with sin and had intent to murder him and that in tarsus was not best longer for him to make his rest he doing so put forth to seas where when men been there's seldom ease for now the wind begins to blow thunder above and deeps below makes such unquiet that the ship should house him safe is wracked and split and he good prince having all lost by waves from coast to coast is tossed all perishen of man of pelf ne aught escapend but himself till fortune tired with doing bad threw him ashore to give him glad and here he comes what shall be next pardon old gower this 'longs the text now sleep yslackèd hath the rout no din but snores about the house made louder by the o'erfed breast of this most pompous marriage feast the cat with eyne of burning coal now couches from the mouse's hole and crickets sing at the oven's mouth are the blither for their drouth hymen hath brought the bride to bed where by the loss of maidenhead a babe is molded be attent and time that is so briefly spent with your fine fancies quaintly eche what's dumb in show i'll plain with speech by many a dern and painful perch of pericles the careful search by the four opposing coigns which the world together joins is made with all due diligence that horse and sail and high expense can stead the quest at last from tyre fame answering the most strange enquire to th' court of king simonides are letters brought the tenor these antiochus and his daughter dead the men of tyrus on the head of helicanus would set on the crown of tyre but he will none the mutiny he there hastes t' oppress says to 'em if king pericles come not home in twice six moons he obedient to their dooms will take the crown the sum of this brought hither to pentapolis y ravishèd the regions round and everyone with claps can sound our heir apparent is a king who dreamt who thought of such a thing brief he must hence depart to tyre his queen with child makes her desire  which who shall cross along to go omit we all their dole and woe lychorida her nurse she takes and so to sea their vessel shakes on neptune's billow half the flood hath their keel cut but fortune moved varies again the grizzled north disgorges such a tempest forth that as a duck for life that dives so up and down the poor ship drives the lady shrieks and well anear does fall in travail with her fear and what ensues in this fell storm shall for itself itself perform i nill relate action may conveniently the rest convey which might not what by me is told in your imagination hold this stage the ship upon whose deck the sea tossed pericles appears to speak imagine pericles arrived at tyre welcomed and settled to his own desire his woeful queen we leave at ephesus unto diana there 's a votaress now to marina bend your mind whom our fast growing scene must find at tarsus and by cleon trained in music letters who hath gained of education all the grace which makes high both the art and place of general wonder but alack that monster envy oft the wrack of earnèd praise marina's life seeks to take off by treason's knife and in this kind our cleon hath one daughter and a full grown wench even ripe for marriage rite this maid hight philoten and it is said for certain in our story she would ever with marina be be 't when they weaved the sleided silk with fingers long small white as milk or when she would with sharp needle wound the cambric which she made more sound by hurting it or when to the lute she sung and made the night bird mute that still records with moan or when she would with rich and constant pen vail to her mistress dian still this philoten contends in skill with absolute marina so with the dove of paphos might the crow vie feathers white marina gets all praises which are paid as debts and not as given this so darks in philoten all graceful marks that cleon's wife with envy rare a present murderer does prepare for good marina that her daughter might stand peerless by this slaughter the sooner her vile thoughts to stead lychorida our nurse is dead and cursèd dionyza hath the pregnant instrument of wrath prest for this blow the unborn event i do commend to your content only i carry wingèd time post on the lame feet of my rhyme which never could i so convey unless your thoughts went on my way dionyza does appear with leonine a murderer thus time we waste and long leagues make short sail seas in cockles have and wish but for 't making to take our imagination from bourn to bourn region to region by you being pardoned we commit no crime to use one language in each several clime where our scenes seems to live i do beseech you to learn of me who stand in the gaps to teach you the stages of our story pericles is now again thwarting the wayward seas attended on by many a lord and knight to see his daughter all his life's delight old helicanus goes along behind is left to govern it you bear in mind old escanes whom helicanus late advanced in time to great and high estate well sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought this king to tarsus think his pilot thought so with his steerage shall your thoughts go on  to fetch his daughter home who first is gone like motes and shadows see them move awhile your ears unto your eyes i'll reconcile see how belief may suffer by foul show this borrowed passion stands for true old woe and pericles in sorrow all devoured with sighs shot through and biggest tears o'ershowered leaves tarsus and again embarks he swears never to wash his face nor cut his hairs he puts on sackcloth and to sea he bears a tempest which his mortal vessel tears and yet he rides it out now please you wit the epitaph is for marina writ by wicked dionyza the fairest sweetest and best lies here who withered in her spring of year she was of tyrus the king's daughter on whom foul death hath made this slaughter marina was she called and at her birth thetis being proud swallowed some part o' th' earth therefore the earth fearing to be o'erflowed hath thetis' birth child on the heavens bestowed wherefore she does and swears she'll never stint  make raging battery upon shores of flint no visor does become black villainy so well as soft and tender flattery let pericles believe his daughter's dead and bear his courses to be orderèd by lady fortune while our scene must play his daughter's woe and heavy welladay in her unholy service patience then and think you now are all in mytilene marina thus the brothel 'scapes and chances into an honest house our story says she sings like one immortal and she dances as goddesslike to her admirèd lays deep clerks she dumbs and with her neele composes nature's own shape of bud bird branch or berry that even her art sisters the natural roses her inkle silk twin with the rubied cherry that pupils lacks she none of noble race who pour their bounty on her and her gain she gives the cursèd bawd here we her place and to her father turn our thoughts again where we left him on the sea we there him lost where driven before the winds he is arrived here where his daughter dwells and on this coast suppose him now at anchor the city strived god neptune's annual feast to keep from whence lysimachus our tyrian ship espies his banners sable trimmed with rich expense and to him in his barge with fervor hies in your supposing once more put your sight of heavy pericles think this his bark where what is done in action more if might  shall be discovered please you sit and hark now our sands are almost run more a little and then dumb this my last boon give me  for such kindness must relieve me  that you aptly will suppose what pageantry what feats what shows what minstrelsy and pretty din the regent made in mytilene to greet the king so he thrived that he is promised to be wived to fair marina but in no wise till he had done his sacrifice as dian bade whereto being bound the interim pray you all confound in feathered briefness sails are filled and wishes fall out as they're willed at ephesus the temple see our king and all his company that he can hither come so soon is by your fancies' thankful doom in antiochus and his daughter you have heard of monstrous lust the due and just reward in pericles his queen and daughter seen although assailed with fortune fierce and keen virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast led on by heaven and crowned with joy at last in helicanus may you well descry a figure of truth of faith of loyalty in reverend cerimon there well appears the worth that learnèd charity aye wears for wicked cleon and his wife when fame had spread his cursèd deed to the honored name of pericles to rage the city turn that him and his they in his palace burn the gods for murder seemèd so content to punish although not done but meant so on your patience evermore attending new joy wait on you here our play has ending
