hence home you idle creatures get you home is this a holiday what know you not being mechanical you ought not walk upon a laboring day without the sign of your profession speak what trade art thou what trade thou knave thou naughty knave what trade thou art a cobbler art thou but wherefore art not in thy shop today why dost thou lead these men about the streets go go good countrymen and for this fault assemble all the poor men of your sort draw them to tiber banks and weep your tears into the channel till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all see whe'er their basest mettle be not moved they vanish tongue tied in their guiltiness go you down that way towards the capitol this way will i disrobe the images if you do find them decked with ceremonies it is no matter let no images be hung with caesar's trophies i'll about and drive away the vulgar from the streets so do you too where you perceive them thick these growing feathers plucked from caesar's wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch who else would soar above the view of men and keep us all in servile fearfulness
