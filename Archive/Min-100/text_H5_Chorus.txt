o for a muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention a kingdom for a stage princes to act and monarchs to behold the swelling scene then should the warlike harry like himself assume the port of mars and at his heels leashed in like hounds should famine sword and fire crouch for employment but pardon gentles all the flat unraisèd spirits that hath dared on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth so great an object can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of france or may we cram within this wooden o the very casques that did affright the air at agincourt o pardon since a crookèd figure may attest in little place a million and let us ciphers to this great account on your imaginary forces work suppose within the girdle of these walls are now confined two mighty monarchies whose high uprearèd and abutting fronts the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder piece out our imperfections with your thoughts into a thousand parts divide one man and make imaginary puissance think when we talk of horses that you see them printing their proud hoofs i' th' receiving earth for 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings carry them here and there jumping o'er times turning th' accomplishment of many years into an hourglass for the which supply admit me chorus to this history who prologue like your humble patience pray gently to hear kindly to judge our play now all the youth of england are on fire and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies now thrive the armorers and honor's thought reigns solely in the breast of every man they sell the pasture now to buy the horse following the mirror of all christian kings with wingèd heels as english mercurys for now sits expectation in the air and hides a sword from hilts unto the point with crowns imperial crowns and coronets promised to harry and his followers the french advised by good intelligence of this most dreadful preparation shake in their fear and with pale policy seek to divert the english purposes o england model to thy inward greatness like little body with a mighty heart what might'st thou do that honor would thee do were all thy children kind and natural but see thy fault france hath in thee found out a nest of hollow bosoms which he fills with treacherous crowns and three corrupted men  one richard earl of cambridge and the second henry lord scroop of masham and the third sir thomas grey knight of northumberland  have for the gilt of france o guilt indeed confirmed conspiracy with fearful france and by their hands this grace of kings must die if hell and treason hold their promises ere he take ship for france and in southampton linger your patience on and we'll digest th' abuse of distance force a play the sum is paid the traitors are agreed the king is set from london and the scene is now transported gentles to southampton there is the playhouse now there must you sit and thence to france shall we convey you safe and bring you back charming the narrow seas to give you gentle pass for if we may we'll not offend one stomach with our play but till the king come forth and not till then unto southampton do we shift our scene thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies in motion of no less celerity than that of thought suppose that you have seen the well appointed king at dover pier embark his royalty and his brave fleet with silken streamers the young phoebus fanning play with your fancies and in them behold upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing hear the shrill whistle which doth order give to sounds confused behold the threaden sails borne with th' invisible and creeping wind draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea breasting the lofty surge o do but think you stand upon the rivage and behold a city on th' inconstant billows dancing for so appears this fleet majestical holding due course to harfleur follow follow grapple your minds to sternage of this navy and leave your england as dead midnight still guarded with grandsires babies and old women either past or not arrived to pith and puissance for who is he whose chin is but enriched with one appearing hair that will not follow these culled and choice drawn cavaliers to france work work your thoughts and therein see a siege behold the ordnance on their carriages with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur suppose th' ambassador from the french comes back tells harry that the king doth offer him katherine his daughter and with her to dowry some petty and unprofitable dukedoms the offer likes not and the nimble gunner with linstock now the devilish cannon touches and down goes all before them still be kind and eke out our performance with your mind now entertain conjecture of a time when creeping murmur and the poring dark fills the wide vessel of the universe from camp to camp through the foul womb of night the hum of either army stilly sounds that the fixed sentinels almost receive the secret whispers of each other's watch fire answers fire and through their paly flames each battle sees the other's umbered face steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs piercing the night's dull ear and from the tents the armorers accomplishing the knights with busy hammers closing rivets up give dreadful note of preparation the country cocks do crow the clocks do toll and the third hour of drowsy morning named proud of their numbers and secure in soul the confident and overlusty french do the low rated english play at dice and chide the cripple tardy gaited night who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp so tediously away the poor condemnèd english like sacrifices by their watchful fires sit patiently and inly ruminate the morning's danger and their gesture sad investing lank lean cheeks and war worn coats presenteth them unto the gazing moon so many horrid ghosts o now who will behold the royal captain of this ruined band walking from watch to watch from tent to tent let him cry praise and glory on his head for forth he goes and visits all his host bids them good morrow with a modest smile and calls them brothers friends and countrymen upon his royal face there is no note how dread an army hath enrounded him nor doth he dedicate one jot of color unto the weary and all watchèd night but freshly looks and overbears attaint with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty that every wretch pining and pale before beholding him plucks comfort from his looks a largesse universal like the sun his liberal eye doth give to everyone thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all behold as may unworthiness define a little touch of harry in the night and so our scene must to the battle fly where o for pity we shall much disgrace with four or five most vile and ragged foils right ill disposed in brawl ridiculous the name of agincourt yet sit and see minding true things by what their mock'ries be vouchsafe to those that have not read the story that i may prompt them and of such as have i humbly pray them to admit th' excuse of time of numbers and due course of things which cannot in their huge and proper life be here presented now we bear the king toward calais grant him there there seen heave him away upon your wingèd thoughts athwart the sea behold the english beach pales in the flood with men wives and boys whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep mouthed sea which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king seems to prepare his way so let him land and solemnly see him set on to london so swift a pace hath thought that even now you may imagine him upon blackheath where that his lords desire him to have borne his bruisèd helmet and his bended sword before him through the city he forbids it being free from vainness and self glorious pride giving full trophy signal and ostent quite from himself to god but now behold in the quick forge and workinghouse of thought how london doth pour out her citizens the mayor and all his brethren in best sort like to the senators of th' antique rome with the plebeians swarming at their heels go forth and fetch their conqu'ring caesar in  as by a lower but by loving likelihood were now the general of our gracious empress as in good time he may from ireland coming bringing rebellion broachèd on his sword how many would the peaceful city quit to welcome him much more and much more cause did they this harry now in london place him as yet the lamentation of the french invites the king of england's stay at home the emperor's coming in behalf of france to order peace between them and omit all the occurrences whatever chanced till harry's back return again to france there must we bring him and myself have played the interim by remembering you 'tis past then brook abridgment and your eyes advance after your thoughts straight back again to france thus far with rough and all unable pen our bending author hath pursued the story in little room confining mighty men mangling by starts the full course of their glory small time but in that small most greatly lived this star of england fortune made his sword by which the world's best garden he achieved and of it left his son imperial lord henry the sixth in infant bands crowned king of france and england did this king succeed whose state so many had the managing that they lost france and made his england bleed which oft our stage hath shown and for their sake in your fair minds let this acceptance take
