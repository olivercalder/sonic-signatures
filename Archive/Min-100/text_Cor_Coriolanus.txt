thanks what's the matter you dissentious rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun your virtue is to make him worthy whose offense subdues him and curse that justice did it who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick man's appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil he that depends upon your favors swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes hang you trust you with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland what's the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another what's their seeking hang 'em they say they'll sit by th' fire and presume to know what's done i' th' capitol who's like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes they say there's grain enough would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword i'd make a quarry with thousands of these quartered slaves as high as i could pick my lance they are dissolved hang 'em they said they were an hungry sighed forth proverbs that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answered and a petition granted them a strange one to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look pale they threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon shouting their emulation five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice one's junius brutus sicinius velutus and i know not 'sdeath the rabble should have first unroofed the city ere so prevailed with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrection's arguing go get you home you fragments here what's the matter i am glad on 't then we shall ha' means to vent our musty superfluity see our best elders they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you to 't i sin in envying his nobility and were i anything but what i am i would wish me only he were half to half the world by th' ears and he upon my party i'd revolt to make only my wars with him he is a lion that i am proud to hunt sir it is and i am constant titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus' face what art thou stiff stand'st out nay let them follow the volsces have much corn take these rats thither to gnaw their garners worshipful mutineers your valor puts well forth pray follow yonder comes news a wager they have met 'tis done say has our general met the enemy i'll buy him of you how far off lie these armies then shall we hear their 'larum and they ours now mars i prithee make us quick in work that we with smoking swords may march from hence to help our fielded friends come blow thy blast tullus aufidius is he within your walls o they are at it they fear us not but issue forth their city  now put your shields before your hearts and fight with hearts more proof than shields advance brave titus they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts which makes me sweat with wrath come on my fellows he that retires i'll take him for a volsce and he shall feel mine edge all the contagion of the south light on you you shames of rome you herd of boils and plagues plaster you o'er that you may be abhorred farther than seen and one infect another against the wind a mile you souls of geese that bear the shapes of men how have you run from slaves that apes would beat pluto and hell all hurt behind backs red and faces pale with flight and agued fear mend and charge home or by the fires of heaven i'll leave the foe and make my wars on you look to 't come on if you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives as they us to our trenches follow 's so now the gates are ope now prove good seconds 'tis for the followers fortune widens them not for the fliers mark me and do the like see here these movers that do prize their hours at a cracked drachma cushions leaden spoons irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would bury with those that wore them these base slaves ere yet the fight be done pack up down with them and hark what noise the general makes to him there is the man of my soul's hate aufidius piercing our romans then valiant titus take convenient numbers to make good the city whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste to help cominius sir praise me not my work hath yet not warmed me fare you well the blood i drop is rather physical than dangerous to me to aufidius thus i will appear and fight thy friend no less than those she placeth highest so farewell come i too late come i too late o let me clip you in arms as sound as when i wooed in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done and tapers burnt to bedward as with a man busied about decrees condemning some to death and some to exile ransoming him or pitying threat'ning th' other holding corioles in the name of rome even like a fawning greyhound in the leash to let him slip at will let him alone he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen the common file a plague tribunes for them  the mouse ne'er shunned the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they will the time serve to tell i do not think where is the enemy are you lords o' th' field if not why cease you till you are so how lies their battle know you on which side they have placed their men of trust i do beseech you by all the battles wherein we have fought by th' blood we have shed together by th' vows we have made to endure friends that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates and that you not delay the present but filling the air with swords advanced and darts we prove this very hour those are they that most are willing if any such be here  as it were sin to doubt that love this painting wherein you see me smeared if any fear lesser his person than an ill report if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his country's dearer than himself let him alone or so many so minded wave thus to express his disposition and follow martius o me alone make you a sword of me if these shows be not outward which of you but is four volsces none of you but is able to bear against the great aufidius a shield as hard as his a certain number though thanks to all must i select from all the rest shall bear the business in some other fight as cause will be obeyed please you to march and i shall quickly draw out my command which men are best inclined i'll fight with none but thee for i do hate thee worse than a promise breaker let the first budger die the other's slave and the gods doom him after within these three hours tullus alone i fought in your corioles' walls and made what work i pleased 'tis not my blood wherein thou seest me masked for thy revenge wrench up thy power to th' highest pray now no more my mother who has a charter to extol her blood when she does praise me grieves me i have done as you have done that's what i can induced as you have been that's for my country he that has but effected his good will hath overta'en mine act i have some wounds upon me and they smart to hear themselves remembered i thank you general but cannot make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it and stand upon my common part with those that have beheld the doing may these same instruments which you profane never sound more when drums and trumpets shall i' th' field prove flatterers let courts and cities be made all of false faced soothing when steel grows soft as the parasite's silk let him be made an ovator for th' wars no more i say for that i have not washed my nose that bled or foiled some debile wretch which without note here's many else have done you shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical as if i loved my little should be dieted in praises sauced with lies i will go wash and when my face is fair you shall perceive whether i blush or no howbeit i thank you i mean to stride your steed and at all times to undercrest your good addition to th' fairness of my power the gods begin to mock me i that now refused most princely gifts am bound to beg of my lord general i sometime lay here in corioles at a poor man's house he used me kindly he cried to me i saw him prisoner but then aufidius was within my view and wrath o'erwhelmed my pity i request you to give my poor host freedom by jupiter forgot i am weary yea my memory is tired have we no wine here no more of this it does offend my heart pray now no more o you have i know petitioned all the gods for my prosperity my gracious silence hail wouldst thou have laughed had i come coffined home that weep'st to see me triumph ah my dear such eyes the widows in corioles wear and mothers that lack sons and live you yet o my sweet lady pardon menenius ever ever your hand and yours ere in our own house i do shade my head the good patricians must be visited from whom i have received not only greetings but with them change of honors know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs your honors pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them no sir yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words you soothed not therefore hurt not but your people i love them as they weigh i had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered i do owe them still my life and services i do beseech you let me o'erleap that custom for i cannot put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing it is a part that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people to brag unto them thus i did and thus show them th' unaching scars which i should hide as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only what must i say i pray sir plague upon 't i cannot bring my tongue to such a pace look sir my wounds i got them in my country's service when some certain of your brethren roared and ran from th' noise of our own drums think upon me hang 'em i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by 'em bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean so here comes a brace  you know the cause sir of my standing here mine own desert ay but not mine own desire no sir 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging well then i pray your price o' th' consulship kindly sir i pray let me ha 't i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir what say you a match sir there's in all two worthy voices begged i have your alms adieu pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown your enigma you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love i will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them 'tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practice the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you i may be consul i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther most sweet voices better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve why in this woolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that does appear their needless vouches custom calls me to 't what custom wills in all things should we do 't the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heaped for truth to o'erpeer rather than fool it so let the high office and the honor go to one that would do thus i am half through the one part suffered the other will i do here come more voices  your voices for your voices i have fought watched for your voices for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six i have seen and heard of for your voices have done many things some less some more your voices indeed i would be consul worthy voices is this done where at the senate house may i change these garments that i'll straight do and knowing myself again repair to th' senate house tullus aufidius then had made new head so then the volsces stand but as at first ready when time shall prompt them to make road upon 's again saw you aufidius spoke he of me how what at antium lives he i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully welcome home behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues o' th' common mouth i do despise them for they do prank them in authority against all noble sufferance ha what is that what makes this change have i had children's voices are these your herd must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues what are your offices you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth have you not set them on it is a purposed thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility suffer 't and live with such as cannot rule nor ever will be ruled why this was known before have you informed them sithence why then should i be consul by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune tell me of corn this was my speech and i will speak 't again now as i live i will my nobler friends i crave their pardons for the mutable rank scented meiny let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves i say again in soothing them we nourish 'gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have plowed for sowed and scattered by mingling them with us the honored number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars how no more as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tetter us yet sought the very way to catch them choler were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove 'twould be my mind shall remain hear you this triton of the minnows mark you his absolute shall shall o good but most unwise patricians why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer that with his peremptory shall being but the horn and noise o' th' monster's wants not spirit to say he'll turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity if you are learned be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the great'st taste most palates theirs they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his shall his popular shall against a graver bench than ever frowned in greece by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter 'twixt the gap of both and take the one by th' other whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o' th' storehouse gratis as 'twas used sometime in greece  though there the people had more absolute power i say they nourished disobedience fed the ruin of the state i'll give my reasons more worthier than their voices they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assured they ne'er did service for 't being pressed to th' war even when the navel of the state was touched they would not thread the gates this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis being i' th' war their mutinies and revolts wherein they showed most valor spoke not for them th' accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the native of our so frank donation well what then how shall this bosom multiplied digest the senate's courtesy let deeds express what's like to be their words we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o' th' senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles no take more what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal this double worship  where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom cannot conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance it must omit real necessities and give way the while to unstable slightness purpose so barred it follows nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you  you that will be less fearful than discreet that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change on 't that prefer a noble life before a long and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic that's sure of death without it at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue let them not lick the sweet which is their poison your dishonor mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should become 't not having the power to do the good it would for th' ill which doth control 't thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee what should the people do with these bald tribunes on whom depending their obedience fails to th' greater bench in a rebellion when what's not meet but what must be was law then were they chosen in a better hour let what is meet be said it must be meet and throw their power i' th' dust hence old goat hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones out of thy garments that is the way to lay the city flat to bring the roof to the foundation and bury all which yet distinctly ranges in heaps and piles of ruin no i'll die here there's some among you have beheld me fighting come try upon yourselves what you have seen me stand fast we have as many friends as enemies i would they were barbarians as they are though in rome littered not romans as they are not though calved i' th' porch o' th' capitol on fair ground i could beat forty of them let them pull all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight yet will i still be thus to them i muse my mother does not approve me further who was wont to call them woolen vassals things created to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads in congregations to yawn be still and wonder when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war i talk of you why did you wish me milder would you have me false to my nature rather say i play the man i am let go let them hang what must i do well what then what then for them i cannot do it to the gods must i then do 't to them tush tush why force you this must i go show them my unbarbèd sconce must i with my base tongue give to my noble heart a lie that it must bear well i will do 't yet were there but this single plot to lose this mold of martius they to dust should grind it and throw 't against the wind to th' marketplace you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to th' life well i must do 't away my disposition and possess me some harlot's spirit my throat of war be turned which choirèd with my drum into a pipe small as an eunuch or the virgin voice that babies lull asleep the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks and schoolboys' tears take up the glasses of my sight a beggar's tongue make motion through my lips and my armed knees who bowed but in my stirrup bend like his that hath received an alms i will not do 't lest i surcease to honor mine own truth and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness pray be content mother i am going to the marketplace chide me no more i'll mountebank their loves cog their hearts from them and come home beloved of all the trades in rome look i am going commend me to my wife i'll return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do i' th' way of flattery further the word is mildly pray you let us go let them accuse me by invention i will answer in mine honor well mildly be it then mildly ay as an hostler that for th' poorest piece will bear the knave by th' volume th' honored gods keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men plant love among 's throng our large temples with the shows of peace and not our streets with war first hear me speak shall i be charged no further than this present must all determine here i am content scratches with briars scars to move laughter only what is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice i am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again say then 'tis true i ought so how traitor the fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the people call me their traitor thou injurious tribune within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths in thy hands clutched as many millions in thy lying tongue both numbers i would say thou liest unto thee with a voice as free as i do pray the gods what do you prate of service you i'll know no further let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death vagabond exile flaying pent to linger but with a grain a day i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word nor check my courage for what they can give to have 't with saying good morrow you common cry of curs whose breath i hate as reek o' th' rotten fens whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air i banish you and here remain with your uncertainty let every feeble rumor shake your hearts your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair have the power still to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance which finds not till it feels making but reservation of yourselves still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows despising for you the city thus i turn my back there is a world elsewhere come leave your tears a brief farewell the beast with many heads butts me away nay mother where is your ancient courage you were used to say extremities was the trier of spirits that common chances common men could bear that when the sea was calm all boats alike showed mastership in floating fortune's blows when most struck home being gentle wounded craves a noble cunning you were used to load me with precepts that would make invincible the heart that conned them nay i prithee woman  what what what i shall be loved when i am lacked nay mother resume that spirit when you were wont to say if you had been the wife of hercules six of his labors you'd have done and saved your husband so much sweat cominius droop not adieu farewell my wife my mother i'll do well yet thou old and true menenius thy tears are salter than a younger man's and venomous to thine eyes my sometime general i have seen thee stern and thou hast oft beheld heart hard'ning spectacles tell these sad women 'tis fond to wail inevitable strokes as 'tis to laugh at 'em my mother you wot well my hazards still have been your solace and  believe 't not lightly though i go alone like to a lonely dragon that his fen makes feared and talked of more than seen your son will or exceed the common or be caught with cautelous baits and practice fare you well thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one that's yet unbruised bring me but out at gate  come my sweet wife my dearest mother and my friends of noble touch when i am forth bid me farewell and smile i pray you come while i remain above the ground you shall hear from me still and never of me aught but what is like me formerly give me thy hand come a goodly city is this antium city 'tis i that made thy widows many an heir of these fair edifices 'fore my wars have i heard groan and drop then know me not lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones in puny battle slay me save you sir direct me if it be your will where great aufidius lies is he in antium which is his house beseech you thank you sir farewell o world thy slippery turns friends now fast sworn whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart whose hours whose bed whose meal and exercise are still together who twin as 'twere in love unseparable shall within this hour on a dissension of a doit break out to bitterest enmity so fellest foes whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep to take the one the other by some chance some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends and interjoin their issues so with me my birthplace hate i and my love's upon this enemy town i'll enter if he slay me he does fair justice if he give me way i'll do his country service a goodly house the feast smells well but i appear not like a guest i have deserved no better entertainment in being coriolanus away now th' art troublesome let me but stand i will not hurt your hearth a gentleman true so i am follow your function go and batten on cold bits under the canopy ay i' th' city of kites and crows no i serve not thy master ay 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress thou prat'st and prat'st serve with thy trencher hence if tullus not yet thou know'st me and seeing me dost not think me for the man i am necessity commands me name myself a name unmusical to the volscians' ears and harsh in sound to thine prepare thy brow to frown know'st thou me yet my name is caius martius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief thereto witness may my surname coriolanus the painful service the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname a good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains the cruelty and envy of the people permitted by our dastard nobles who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest and suffered me by th' voice of slaves to be whooped out of rome now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope  mistake me not to save my life for if i had feared death of all the men i' th' world i would have 'voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight and make my misery serve thy turn so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee for i will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends but if so be thou dar'st not this and that to prove more fortunes thou 'rt tired then in a word i also am longer to live most weary and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever followed thee with hate drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee service you bless me gods what's the matter away wife mother child i know not my affairs are servanted to others though i owe my revenge properly my remission lies in volscian breasts that we have been familiar ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather than pity note how much therefore begone mine ears against your suits are stronger than your gates against my force yet for i loved thee take this along i writ it for thy sake and would have sent it another word menenius i will not hear thee speak this man aufidius was my beloved in rome yet thou behold'st we will before the walls of rome tomorrow set down our host my partner in this action you must report to th' volscian lords how plainly i have borne this business this last old man whom with a cracked heart i have sent to rome loved me above the measure of a father nay godded me indeed their latest refuge was to send him for whose old love i have  though i showed sourly to him once more offered the first conditions which they did refuse and cannot now accept to grace him only that thought he could do more a very little i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits nor from the state nor private friends hereafter will i lend ear to ha what shout is this shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time 'tis made i will not my wife comes foremost then the honored mold wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand the grandchild to her blood but out affection all bond and privilege of nature break let it be virtuous to be obstinate what is that curtsy worth or those doves' eyes which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not of stronger earth than others my mother bows as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod and my young boy hath an aspect of intercession which great nature cries deny not let the volsces plow rome and harrow italy i'll never be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin these eyes are not the same i wore in rome like a dull actor now i have forgot my part and i am out even to a full disgrace best of my flesh forgive my tyranny but do not say for that forgive our romans o a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss i carried from thee dear and my true lip hath virgined it e'er since you gods i prate and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted sink my knee i' th' earth of thy deep duty more impression show than that of common sons what's this your knees to me to your corrected son then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun murdering impossibility to make what cannot be slight work the noble sister of publicola the moon of rome chaste as the icicle that's curdied by the frost from purest snow and hangs on dian's temple dear valeria the god of soldiers with the consent of supreme jove inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove to shame unvulnerable and stick i' th' wars like a great seamark standing every flaw and saving those that eye thee that's my brave boy i beseech you peace or if you'd ask remember this before the thing i have forsworn to grant may never be held by you denials do not bid me dismiss my soldiers or capitulate again with rome's mechanics tell me not wherein i seem unnatural desire not t' allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons aufidius and you volsces mark for we'll hear naught from rome in private your request not of a woman's tenderness to be requires nor child nor woman's face to see  i have sat too long o mother mother what have you done behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at o my mother mother o you have won a happy victory to rome but for your son believe it o believe it  most dangerously you have with him prevailed if not most mortal to him but let it come  aufidius though i cannot make true wars i'll frame convenient peace now good aufidius were you in my stead would you have heard a mother less or granted less aufidius i dare be sworn you were and sir it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion but good sir what peace you'll make advise me for my part i'll not to rome i'll back with you and pray you stand to me in this cause o mother wife ay by and by but we will drink together and you shall bear a better witness back than words which we on like conditions will have countersealed come enter with us ladies you deserve to have a temple built you all the swords in italy and her confederate arms could not have made this peace hail lords i am returned your soldier no more infected with my country's love than when i parted hence but still subsisting under your great command you are to know that prosperously i have attempted and with bloody passage led your wars even to the gates of rome our spoils we have brought home doth more than counterpoise a full third part the charges of the action we have made peace with no less honor to the antiates than shame to th' romans and we here deliver subscribed by' th' consuls and patricians together with the seal o' th' senate what we have compounded on traitor how now martius hear'st thou mars ha measureless liar thou hast made my heart too great for what contains it boy o slave  pardon me lords 'tis the first time that ever i was forced to scold your judgments my grave lords must give this cur the lie and his own notion  who wears my stripes impressed upon him that must bear my beating to his grave shall join to thrust the lie unto him cut me to pieces volsces men and lads stain all your edges on me boy false hound if you have writ your annals true 'tis there that like an eagle in a dovecote i fluttered your volscians in corioles alone i did it boy o that i had him with six aufidiuses or more his tribe to use my lawful sword
