the soft phrase of peace for since these arms of mine had seven years' pith till now some nine moons wasted they have used their dearest action in the tented field and little of this great world can i speak more than pertains to feats of broil and battle and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself yet by your gracious patience i will a round unvarnished tale deliver of my whole course of love what drugs what charms what conjuration and what mighty magic for such proceeding i am charged withal i won his daughter i do beseech you send for the lady to the sagittary and

her father loved me oft invited me still questioned me the story of my life from year to year the battles sieges fortunes that i have passed i ran it through even from my boyish days to th' very moment that he bade me tell it wherein i spoke of most disastrous chances of moving accidents by flood and field of hairbreadth 'scapes i' th' imminent deadly breach of being taken by the insolent foe and sold to slavery of my redemption thence and portance in my traveler's history wherein of antres vast and deserts idle rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven it was my hint to speak such was my process  and of the cannibals that each other eat the anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders these things to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the house affairs would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch she'd come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcels she had something heard but not intentively i did consent and often did beguile her of her tears when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffered my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sighs she swore in faith 'twas strange 'twas passing strange 'twas pitiful 'twas wondrous pitiful she wished she had not heard it yet she wished that heaven had made her such a man she thanked me and bade me if i had a friend that loved her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her upon this hint i spake she loved me for the dangers i had passed and i loved her that she did pity them this only is the witchcraft i have used here

your name is great in mouths of wisest censure what's the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a night brawler give me answer to it now by heaven my blood begins my safer guides to rule and passion having my best judgment collied assays to lead the way zounds if i stir or do but lift this arm the best of you shall sink in my rebuke give me to know how this foul rout began who set it on and he that is approved in this offense though he had twinned with me both at a birth shall lose me what in a town of war yet wild the people's hearts brimful of fear to manage private and domestic quarrel in night and on the court and guard of safety 'tis monstrous iago who began 't i know iago thy honesty and love doth mince this matter making it light to cassio cassio i love thee but nevermore be officer of mine look if my gentle love be not raised up i'll make thee an example all's well now sweeting come away to bed sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon lead him off iago look with care about the town and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted  come desdemona 'tis the soldier's life to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife these letters give iago to the pilot and by him do my duties to the senate that done i will be walking on the works repair there to me this fortification gentlemen shall we see 't what dost thou say

home i meet the captains at the citadel prithee no more let him come when he will i will deny thee nothing i will deny thee nothing whereon i do beseech thee grant me this to leave me but a little to myself farewell my desdemona i'll come to thee straight excellent wretch perdition catch my soul but i do love thee and when i love thee not chaos is come again what dost thou say iago he did from first to last why dost thou ask why of thy thought iago o yes and went between us very oft indeed ay indeed discern'st thou aught in that is he not honest honest ay honest what dost thou think think my lord by heaven thou echo'st me as if there were some monster in thy thought too hideous to be shown thou dost mean something i heard thee say even now thou lik'st not that when cassio left my wife what didst not like and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing thou cried'st indeed and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit if thou dost love me show me thy thought i think thou dost and for i know thou 'rt full of love and honesty and weigh'st thy words before thou giv'st them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom but in a man that's just they're close dilations working from the heart that passion cannot rule i think so too certain men should be what they seem nay yet there's more in this i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words thou dost conspire against thy friend iago if thou but think'st him wronged and mak'st his ear a stranger to thy thoughts what dost thou mean by heaven i'll know thy thoughts ha o misery why why is this think'st thou i'd make a life of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises matching thy inference 'tis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are more virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me no iago i'll see before i doubt when i doubt prove and on the proof there is no more but this away at once with love or jealousy dost thou say so and so she did i am bound to thee forever not a jot not a jot i will not no not much moved i do not think but desdemona's honest and yet how nature erring from itself  farewell farewell if more thou dost perceive let me know more set on thy wife to observe leave me iago why did i marry this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more much more than he unfolds fear not my government this fellow's of exceeding honesty and knows all qualities with a learn√®d spirit of human dealings if i do prove her haggard though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings i'd whistle her off and let her down the wind to prey at fortune haply for i am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have or for i am declined into the vale of years yet that's not much  she's gone i am abused and my relief must be to loathe her o curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapor of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others' uses yet 'tis the plague of great ones prerogatived are they less than the base 'tis destiny unshunnable like death even then this fork√®d plague is fated to us when we do quicken look where she comes if she be false heaven mocks itself i'll not believe 't i am to blame i have a pain upon my forehead here your napkin is too little let it alone come i'll go in with you ha ha false to me avaunt begone thou hast set me on the rack i swear 'tis better to be much abused than but to know 't a little what sense had i of her stol'n hours of lust i saw 't not thought it not it harmed not me i slept the next night well fed well was free and merry i found not cassio's kisses on her lips he that is robbed not wanting what is stol'n let him not know 't and he's not robbed at all i had been happy if the general camp pioners and all had tasted her sweet body so i had nothing known o now forever farewell the tranquil mind farewell content farewell the plum√®d troops and the big wars that makes ambition virtue o farewell farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spirit stirring drum th' ear piercing fife the royal banner and all quality pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war and o you mortal engines whose rude throats th' immortal jove's dread clamors counterfeit farewell othello's occupation's gone villain be sure thou prove my love a whore be sure of it give me the ocular proof or by the worth of mine eternal soul thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my waked wrath make me to see 't or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life if thou dost slander her and torture me never pray more abandon all remorse on horror's head horrors accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that nay stay thou shouldst be honest by the world i think my wife be honest and think she is not i think that thou art just and think thou art not i'll have some proof her name that was as fresh as dian's visage is now begrimed and black as mine own face if there be cords or knives poison or fire or suffocating streams i'll not endure it would i were satisfied would nay and i will death and damnation o give me a living reason she's disloyal o monstrous monstrous but this denoted a foregone conclusion 'tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream i'll tear her all to pieces i gave her such a one 'twas my first gift if it be that  o that the slave had forty thousand lives one is too poor too weak for my revenge now do i see 'tis true look here iago all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven 'tis gone arise black vengeance from the hollow hell yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught for 'tis of aspics' tongues o blood blood blood never iago like to the pontic sea whose icy current and compulsive course ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on to the propontic and the hellespont even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them up now by yond marble heaven in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words i greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous and will upon the instant put thee to 't within these three days let me hear thee say that cassio's not alive damn her lewd minx o damn her damn her come go with me apart i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil now art thou my lieutenant well my good lady o hardness to dissemble  how do you desdemona give me your hand this hand is moist my lady this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer much castigation exercise devout for here's a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels 'tis a good hand a frank one a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands but our new heraldry is hands not hearts what promise chuck i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me lend me thy handkerchief that which i gave you not that's a fault that handkerchief did an egyptian to my mother give she was a charmer and could almost read the thoughts of people she told her while she kept it 'twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love but if she lost it or made a gift of it my father's eye should hold her loath√®d and his spirits should hunt after new fancies she dying gave it me and bid me when my fate would have me wived to give it her i did so and take heed on 't make it a darling like your precious eye to lose 't or give 't away were such perdition as nothing else could match 'tis true there's magic in the web of it a sybil that had numbered in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses in her prophetic fury sewed the work the worms were hallowed that did breed the silk and it was dyed in mummy which the skillful conserved of maidens' hearts most veritable therefore look to 't well ha wherefore is 't lost is 't gone speak is 't out o' th' way say you how fetch 't let me see 't fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives the handkerchief the handkerchief the handkerchief zounds think so iago an unauthorized kiss naked in bed iago and not mean harm it is hypocrisy against the devil they that mean virtuously and yet do so the devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven what then she is protectress of her honor too may she give that by heaven i would most gladly have forgot it thou saidst o it comes o'er my memory as doth the raven o'er the infectious house boding to all he had my handkerchief that's not so good now hath he said anything what hath he said what what with her lie with her lie on her we say lie on her when they belie her lie with her zounds that's fulsome handkerchief confessions handkerchief to confess and be hanged for his labor first to be hanged and then to confess i tremble at it nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction it is not words that shakes me thus pish noses ears and lips is 't possible confess handkerchief o devil dost thou mock me a horn√®d man's a monster and a beast did he confess it o thou art wise 'tis certain dost thou hear iago i will be found most cunning in my patience but dost thou hear most bloody look how he laughs already now he denies it faintly and laughs it out now he importunes him to tell it o'er go to well said well said do you triumph roman do you triumph so so so so they laugh that wins have you scored me well iago beckons me now he begins the story crying o dear cassio as it were his gesture imports it now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber o i see that nose of yours but not that dog i shall throw it to by heaven that should be my handkerchief how shall i murder him iago o iago was that mine i would have him nine years a killing a fine woman a fair woman a sweet woman ay let her rot and perish and be damned tonight for she shall not live no my heart is turned to stone i strike it and it hurts my hand o the world hath not a sweeter creature she might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks hang her i do but say what she is so delicate with her needle an admirable musician  o she will sing the savageness out of a bear of so high and plenteous wit and invention o a thousand a thousand times and then of so gentle a condition nay that's certain but yet the pity of it iago o iago the pity of it iago i will chop her into messes cuckold me with mine officer get me some poison iago this night i'll not expostulate with her lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again this night iago good good the justice of it pleases very good excellent good what trumpet is that same with all my heart sir i kiss the instrument of their pleasures are you sure of that this fail you not to do as you will  fire and brimstone are you wise indeed i am glad to see you mad devil o devil devil if that

nothing that's strange bid her come hither go she says enough yet she's a simple bawd that cannot say as much this is a subtle whore a closet lock and key of villainous secrets and yet she'll kneel and pray i have seen her do 't pray you chuck come hither let me see your eyes look in my face some of your function mistress leave procreants alone and shut the door cough or cry hem if anybody come your mystery your mystery nay dispatch why what art thou come swear it damn thyself lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves should fear to seize thee therefore be double damned swear thou art honest heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell ah desdemon away away away had it pleased heaven to try me with affliction had they rained all kind of sores and shames on my bare head steeped me in poverty to the very lips given to captivity me and my utmost hopes i should have found in some place of my soul a drop of patience but alas to make me a fix√®d figure for the time of scorn to point his slow unmoving finger at  yet could i bear that too well very well but there where i have garnered up my heart where either i must live or bear no life the fountain from the which my current runs or else dries up to be discarded thence or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in turn thy complexion there patience thou young and rose lipped cherubin ay there look grim as hell o ay as summer flies are in the shambles that quicken even with blowing o thou weed who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst ne'er been born was this fair paper this most goodly book made to write whore upon what committed committed o thou public commoner i should make very forges of my cheeks that would to cinders burn up modesty did i but speak thy deeds what committed heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets is hushed within the hollow mine of earth and will not hear 't what committed impudent strumpet are not you a strumpet what not a whore is 't possible i cry you mercy then i took you for that cunning whore of venice that married with othello you mistress that have the office opposite to saint peter and keeps the gate of hell you you ay you we have done our course there's money for your pains i pray you turn the key and keep our counsel o pardon me 'twill do me good to walk will you walk sir o desdemona  get you to bed on th' instant i will be returned forthwith dismiss your attendant there look 't be done the voice of cassio iago keeps his word it is even so 'tis he o brave iago honest and just that hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong thou teachest me minion your dear lies dead and your unblest fate hies strumpet i come forth of my heart those charms thine eyes are blotted thy bed lust stained shall with lust's blood be spotted it is the cause it is the cause my soul let me not name it to you you chaste stars it is the cause yet i'll not shed her blood nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow and smooth as monumental alabaster yet she must die else she'll betray more men put out the light and then put out the light if i quench thee thou flaming minister i can again thy former light restore should i repent me but once put out thy light thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature i know not where is that promethean heat that can thy light relume when i have plucked the rose i cannot give it vital growth again it needs must wither i'll smell it on the tree o balmy breath that dost almost persuade justice to break her sword one more one more be thus when thou art dead and i will kill thee and love thee after one more and this the last so sweet was ne'er so fatal i must weep but they are cruel tears this sorrow's heavenly it strikes where it doth love she wakes ay desdemona have you prayed tonight desdemon if you bethink yourself of any crime unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace solicit for it straight well do it and be brief i will walk by i would not kill thy unprepar√®d spirit no heaven forfend i would not kill thy soul ay i do amen with all my heart humh think on thy sins ay and for that thou diest peace and be still that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee thou gav'st to cassio sweet soul take heed take heed of perjury thou art on thy deathbed yes presently therefore confess thee freely of thy sin for to deny each article with oath cannot remove nor choke the strong conception that i do groan withal thou art to die i say amen by heaven i saw my handkerchief in 's hand o perjured woman thou dost stone my heart and mak'st me call what i intend to do a murder which i thought a sacrifice i saw the handkerchief he hath confessed that he hath used thee ay no his mouth is stopped honest iago hath ta'en order for 't had all his hairs been lives my great revenge had stomach for them all out strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face down strumpet nay if you strive  being done there is no pause it is too late what noise is this not dead not yet quite dead i that am cruel am yet merciful i would not have thee linger in thy pain so so who's there yes 'tis emilia by and by she's dead 'tis like she comes to speak of cassio's death the noise was here ha no more moving still as the grave shall she come in were 't good i think she stirs again no what's best to do if she come in she'll sure speak to my wife my wife my wife what wife i have no wife o insupportable o heavy hour methinks it should be now a huge eclipse of sun and moon and that th' affrighted globe should yawn at alteration i had forgot thee o come in emilia  soft by and by let me the curtains draw  where art thou what's the matter with thee now what now it is the very error of the moon she comes more nearer earth than she was wont and makes men mad roderigo killed and cassio killed not cassio killed then murder's out of tune and sweet revenge grows harsh that what why how should she be murdered you heard her say herself it was not i she's like a liar gone to burning hell 'twas i that killed her she turned to folly and she was a whore she was false as water cassio did top her ask thy husband else o i were damned beneath all depth in hell but that i did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity thy husband knew it all thy husband ay with cassio had she been true if heaven would make me such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite i'd not have sold her for it ay 'twas he that told me on her first an honest man he is and hates the slime that sticks on filthy deeds what needs this iterance woman i say thy husband he woman i say thy husband dost understand the word my friend thy husband honest honest iago hah peace you were best nay stare not masters it is true indeed o o o o she was foul  i scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopped i know this act shows horrible and grim 'tis pitiful but yet iago knows that she with cassio hath the act of shame a thousand times committed cassio confessed it and she did gratify his amorous works with that recognizance and pledge of love which i first gave her i saw it in his hand it was a handkerchief an antique token my father gave my mother are there no stones in heaven but what serves for the thunder precious villain i am not valiant neither but every puny whipster gets my sword but why should honor outlive honesty let it go all i have another weapon in this chamber it is a sword of spain the ice brook's temper o here it is uncle i must come forth look in upon me then and speak with me or naked as i am i will assault thee behold i have a weapon a better never did itself sustain upon a soldier's thigh i have seen the day that with this little arm and this good sword i have made my way through more impediments than twenty times your stop but o vain boast  who can control his fate 'tis not so now be not afraid though you do see me weaponed here is my journey's end here is my butt and very sea mark of my utmost sail do you go back dismayed 'tis a lost fear man but a rush against othello's breast and he retires where should othello go now how dost thou look now o ill starred wench pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven and fiends will snatch at it cold cold my girl even like thy chastity o curs√®d curs√®d slave  whip me you devils from the possession of this heavenly sight blow me about in winds roast me in sulfur wash me in steep down gulfs of liquid fire o desdemon dead desdemon dead o o that's he that was othello here i am i look down towards his feet but that's a fable  if that thou be'st a devil i cannot kill thee i am not sorry neither i'd have thee live for in my sense 'tis happiness to die why anything an honorable murderer if you will for naught i did in hate but all in honor ay i do believe it and i ask your pardon will you i pray demand that demi devil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body well thou dost best o villain o thou pernicious caitiff  how came you cassio by that handkerchief that was my wife's o fool fool fool soft you a word or two before you go i have done the state some service and they know 't no more of that i pray you in your letters when you shall these unlucky deeds relate speak of me as i am nothing extenuate nor set down aught in malice then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well of one not easily jealous but being wrought perplexed in the extreme of one whose hand like the base judean threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes albeit unused to the melting mood drops tears as fast as the arabian trees their medicinable gum set you down this and say besides that in aleppo once where a malignant and a turbanned turk beat a venetian and traduced the state i took by th' throat the circumcis√®d dog and smote him thus i kissed thee ere i killed thee no way but this killing myself to die upon a kiss
