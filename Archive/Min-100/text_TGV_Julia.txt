but say lucetta now we are alone wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love of all the fair resort of gentlemen that every day with parle encounter me in thy opinion which is worthiest love what think'st thou of the fair sir eglamour what think'st thou of the rich mercatio what think'st thou of the gentle proteus how now what means this passion at his name why not on proteus as of all the rest your reason and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him why he of all the rest hath never moved me his little speaking shows his love but small they do not love that do not show their love i would i knew his mind to julia say from whom say say who gave it thee now by my modesty a goodly broker dare you presume to harbor wanton lines to whisper and conspire against my youth now trust me 'tis an office of great worth and you an officer fit for the place there take the paper see it be returned or else return no more into my sight will you be gone and yet i would i had o'erlooked the letter it were a shame to call her back again and pray her to a fault for which i chid her what fool is she that knows i am a maid and would not force the letter to my view since maids in modesty say no to that which they would have the profferer construe ay fie fie how wayward is this foolish love that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse and presently all humbled kiss the rod how churlishly i chid lucetta hence when willingly i would have had her here how angerly i taught my brow to frown when inward joy enforced my heart to smile my penance is to call lucetta back and ask remission for my folly past  what ho lucetta is 't near dinner time what is 't that you took up so gingerly why didst thou stoop then and is that paper nothing then let it lie for those that it concerns some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme as little by such toys as may be possible best sing it to the tune of light o' love heavy belike it hath some burden then and why not you let's see your song how now minion you do not you minion are too saucy the mean is drowned with your unruly bass this babble shall not henceforth trouble me here is a coil with protestation go get you gone and let the papers lie you would be fing'ring them to anger me nay would i were so angered with the same o hateful hands to tear such loving words injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey and kill the bees that yield it with your stings i'll kiss each several paper for amends look here is writ kind julia unkind julia as in revenge of thy ingratitude i throw thy name against the bruising stones trampling contemptuously on thy disdain and here is writ love wounded proteus poor wounded name my bosom as a bed shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly healed and thus i search it with a sovereign kiss but twice or thrice was proteus written down be calm good wind blow not a word away till i have found each letter in the letter except mine own name that some whirlwind bear unto a ragged fearful hanging rock and throw it thence into the raging sea lo here in one line is his name twice writ poor forlorn proteus passionate proteus to the sweet julia that i'll tear away  and yet i will not sith so prettily he couples it to his complaining names thus will i fold them one upon another now kiss embrace contend do what you will well let us go if you respect them best to take them up i see you have a month's mind to them come come will 't please you go i must where is no remedy if you turn not you will return the sooner keep this remembrance for thy julia's sake and seal the bargain with a holy kiss counsel lucetta gentle girl assist me and ev'n in kind love i do conjure thee  who art the table wherein all my thoughts are visibly charactered and engraved  to lesson me and tell me some good mean how with my honor i may undertake a journey to my loving proteus a true devoted pilgrim is not weary to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps much less shall she that hath love's wings to fly and when the flight is made to one so dear of such divine perfection as sir proteus o know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food pity the dearth that i have pinèd in by longing for that food so long a time didst thou but know the inly touch of love thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow as seek to quench the fire of love with words the more thou damm'st it up the more it burns the current that with gentle murmur glides thou know'st being stopped impatiently doth rage but when his fair course is not hinderèd he makes sweet music with th' enameled stones giving a gentle kiss to every sedge he overtaketh in his pilgrimage and so by many winding nooks he strays with willing sport to the wild ocean then let me go and hinder not my course i'll be as patient as a gentle stream and make a pastime of each weary step till the last step have brought me to my love and there i'll rest as after much turmoil a blessèd soul doth in elysium not like a woman for i would prevent the loose encounters of lascivious men gentle lucetta fit me with such weeds as may beseem some well reputed page no girl i'll knit it up in silken strings with twenty odd conceited true love knots to be fantastic may become a youth of greater time than i shall show to be that fits as well as tell me good my lord what compass will you wear your farthingale why ev'n what fashion thou best likes lucetta out out lucetta that will be ill favored lucetta as thou lov'st me let me have what thou think'st meet and is most mannerly but tell me wench how will the world repute me for undertaking so unstaid a journey i fear me it will make me scandalized nay that i will not that is the least lucetta of my fear a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears and instances of infinite of love warrant me welcome to my proteus base men that use them to so base effect but truer stars did govern proteus' birth his words are bonds his oaths are oracles his love sincere his thoughts immaculate his tears pure messengers sent from his heart his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth now as thou lov'st me do him not that wrong to bear a hard opinion of his truth only deserve my love by loving him and presently go with me to my chamber to take a note of what i stand in need of to furnish me upon my longing journey all that is mine i leave at thy dispose my goods my lands my reputation only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence come answer not but to it presently i am impatient of my tarriance marry mine host because i cannot be merry but shall i hear him speak that will be music is he among these you mistake the musician likes me not he plays false father not so but yet so false that he grieves my very heart strings ay i would i were deaf it makes me have a slow heart not a whit when it jars so ay that change is the spite i would always have one play but one thing but host doth this sir proteus that we talk on often resort unto this gentlewoman where is lance peace stand aside the company parts 'twere false if i should speak it for i am sure she is not burièd he heard not that if 'twere a substance you would sure deceive it and make it but a shadow as i am host will you go pray you where lies sir proteus not so but it hath been the longest night that e'er i watched and the most heaviest in what you please i'll do what i can it seems you loved not her to leave her token she is dead belike alas i cannot choose but pity her because methinks that she loved you as well as you do love your lady sylvia she dreams on him that has forgot her love you dote on her that cares not for your love 'tis pity love should be so contrary and thinking on it makes me cry alas how many women would do such a message alas poor proteus thou hast entertained a fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs alas poor fool why do i pity him that with his very heart despiseth me because he loves her he despiseth me because i love him i must pity him this ring i gave him when he parted from me to bind him to remember my good will and now am i unhappy messenger to plead for that which i would not obtain to carry that which i would have refused to praise his faith which i would have dispraised i am my master's true confirmèd love but cannot be true servant to my master unless i prove false traitor to myself yet will i woo for him but yet so coldly as heaven it knows i would not have him speed gentlewoman good day i pray you be my mean to bring me where to speak with madam sylvia if you be she i do entreat your patience to hear me speak the message i am sent on from my master sir proteus madam ay madam madam please you peruse this letter pardon me madam i have unadvised delivered you a paper that i should not this is the letter to your ladyship it may not be good madam pardon me madam he sends your ladyship this ring she thanks you i thank you madam that you tender her poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much almost as well as i do know myself to think upon her woes i do protest that i have wept a hundred several times i think she doth and that's her cause of sorrow she hath been fairer madam than she is when she did think my master loved her well she in my judgment was as fair as you but since she did neglect her looking glass and threw her sun expelling mask away the air hath starved the roses in her cheeks and pinched the lily tincture of her face that now she is become as black as i about my stature for at pentecost when all our pageants of delight were played our youth got me to play the woman's part and i was trimmed in madam julia's gown which served me as fit by all men's judgments as if the garment had been made for me therefore i know she is about my height and at that time i made her weep agood for i did play a lamentable part madam 'twas ariadne passioning for theseus' perjury and unjust flight which i so lively acted with my tears that my poor mistress movèd therewithal wept bitterly and would i might be dead if i in thought felt not her very sorrow and she shall thank you for 't if e'er you know her a virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful i hope my master's suit will be but cold since she respects my mistress' love so much  alas how love can trifle with itself here is her picture let me see i think if i had such a tire this face of mine were full as lovely as is this of hers and yet the painter flattered her a little unless i flatter with myself too much her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow if that be all the difference in his love i'll get me such a colored periwig her eyes are gray as glass and so are mine ay but her forehead's low and mine's as high what should it be that he respects in her but i can make respective in myself if this fond love were not a blinded god come shadow come and take this shadow up for 'tis thy rival o thou senseless form thou shalt be worshipped kissed loved and adored and were there sense in his idolatry my substance should be statue in thy stead i'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake that used me so or else by jove i vow i should have scratched out your unseeing eyes to make my master out of love with thee but love will not be spurred to what it loathes 'tis true such pearls as put out ladies' eyes for i had rather wink than look on them but better indeed when you hold your peace she needs not when she knows it cowardice true from a gentleman to a fool that such an ass should owe them here comes the duke and i will follow more to cross that love than hate for sylvia that is gone for love and me when he approacheth to your presence o me unhappy o good sir my master charged me to deliver a ring to madam sylvia which out of my neglect was never done here 'tis this is it o cry you mercy sir i have mistook this is the ring you sent to sylvia and julia herself did give it me and julia herself hath brought it hither behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths and entertained 'em deeply in her heart how oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root o proteus let this habit make thee blush be thou ashamed that i have took upon me such an immodest raiment if shame live in a disguise of love it is the lesser blot modesty finds women to change their shapes than men their minds and i mine
