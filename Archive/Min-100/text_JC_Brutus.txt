a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march not i i am not gamesome i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony let me not hinder cassius your desires i'll leave you cassius be not deceived if i have veiled my look i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself vexèd i am of late with passions of some difference conceptions only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors but let not therefore my good friends be grieved among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutus with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men no cassius for the eye sees not itself but by reflection by some other things into what dangers would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me what means this shouting i do fear the people choose caesar for their king i would not cassius yet i love him well but wherefore do you hold me here so long what is it that you would impart to me if it be aught toward the general good set honor in one eye and death i' th' other and i will look on both indifferently for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honor more than i fear death another general shout i do believe that these applauses are for some new honors that are heaped on caesar that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further moved what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things till then my noble friend chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us the games are done and caesar is returning i will do so but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesar's brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calphurnia's cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being crossed in conference by some senators ay casca tell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad i should not then ask casca what had chanced what was the second noise for was the crown offered him thrice tell us the manner of it gentle casca 'tis very like he hath the falling sickness what said he when he came unto himself and after that he came thus sad away what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school and so it is for this time i will leave you tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you what lucius ho  i cannot by the progress of the stars give guess how near to day lucius i say  i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly  when lucius when awake i say what lucius get me a taper in my study lucius when it is lighted come and call me here it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general he would be crowned how that might change his nature there's the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking crown him that and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with th' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections swayed more than his reason but 'tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambition's ladder whereto the climber upward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpent's egg which hatched would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell get you to bed again it is not day is not tomorrow boy the ides of march look in the calendar and bring me word the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself shall rome etc speak strike redress brutus thou sleep'st awake such instigations have been often dropped where i have took them up shall rome etc thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one man's awe what rome my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was called a king speak strike redress am i entreated to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus 'tis good go to the gate somebody knocks since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection is he alone do you know them let 'em enter they are the faction o conspiracy sham'st thou to show thy dang'rous brow by night when evils are most free o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention i have been up this hour awake all night know i these men that come along with you he is welcome hither he is welcome too they are all welcome what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night give me your hands all over one by one no not an oath if not the face of men the sufferance of our souls the time's abuse  if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let high sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery but if these  as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valor the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath passed from him o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow anything that other men begin our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar let's be sacrificers but not butchers caius we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesar's spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide 'em this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be called purgers not murderers and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesar's arm when caesar's head is off alas good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wildness and much company peace count the clock by the eighth hour is that the uttermost now good metellus go along by him he loves me well and i have given him reasons send him but hither and i'll fashion him good gentlemen look fresh and merrily let not our looks put on our purposes but bear it as our roman actors do with untired spirits and formal constancy and so good morrow to you every one boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber thou hast no figures nor no fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men therefore thou sleep'st so sound portia what mean you wherefore rise you now it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning i am not well in health and that is all why so i do good portia go to bed kneel not gentle portia you are my true and honorable wife as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart o you gods render me worthy of this noble wife hark hark one knocks portia go in awhile and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart all my engagements i will construe to thee all the charactery of my sad brows leave me with haste lucius who 's that knocks caius ligarius that metellus spoke of  boy stand aside caius ligarius how o what a time have you chose out brave caius to wear a kerchief would you were not sick such an exploit have i in hand ligarius had you a healthful ear to hear of it a piece of work that will make sick men whole that must we also what it is my caius i shall unfold to thee as we are going to whom it must be done follow me then caesar 'tis strucken eight that every like is not the same o caesar the heart of brutus earns to think upon what said popilius lena look how he makes to caesar mark him cassius be constant popilius lena speaks not of our purposes for look he smiles and caesar doth not change he is addressed press near and second him i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal people and senators be not affrighted fly not stand still ambition's debt is paid where's publius talk not of standing publius good cheer there is no harm intended to your person nor to no roman else so tell them publius do so and let no man abide this deed but we the doers fates we will know your pleasures that we shall die we know 'tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon grant that and then is death a benefit so are we caesar's friends that have abridged his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop and let us bathe our hands in caesar's blood up to the elbows and besmear our swords then walk we forth even to the marketplace and waving our red weapons o'er our heads let's all cry peace freedom and liberty how many times shall caesar bleed in sport that now on pompey's basis lies along no worthier than the dust soft who comes here a friend of antony's thy master is a wise and valiant roman i never thought him worse tell him so please him come unto this place he shall be satisfied and by my honor depart untouched i know that we shall have him well to friend but here comes antony welcome mark antony o antony beg not your death of us though now we must appear bloody and cruel as by our hands and this our present act you see we do yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done our hearts you see not they are pitiful and pity to the general wrong of rome as fire drives out fire so pity pity hath done this deed on caesar for your part to you our swords have leaden points mark antony our arms in strength of malice and our hearts of brothers' temper do receive you in with all kind love good thoughts and reverence only be patient till we have appeased the multitude beside themselves with fear and then we will deliver you the cause why i that did love caesar when i struck him have thus proceeded or else were this a savage spectacle our reasons are so full of good regard that were you antony the son of caesar you should be satisfied you shall mark antony by your pardon i will myself into the pulpit first and show the reason of our caesar's death what antony shall speak i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies it shall advantage more than do us wrong mark antony here take you caesar's body you shall not in your funeral speech blame us but speak all good you can devise of caesar and say you do 't by our permission else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going after my speech is ended prepare the body then and follow us then follow me and give me audience friends  cassius go you into the other street and part the numbers  those that will hear me speak let 'em stay here those that will follow cassius go with him and public reasons shall be renderèd of caesar's death be patient till the last romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear believe me for mine honor and have respect to mine honor that you may believe censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of caesar's to him i say that brutus' love to caesar was no less than his if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer not that i loved caesar less but that i loved rome more had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live all freemen as caesar loved me i weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was valiant i honor him but as he was ambitious i slew him there is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor and death for his ambition who is here so base that would be a bondman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so rude that would not be a roman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so vile that will not love his country if any speak for him have i offended i pause for a reply then none have i offended i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death here comes his body mourned by mark antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not with this i depart that as i slew my best lover for the good of rome i have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death my countrymen  good countrymen let me depart alone and for my sake stay here with antony do grace to caesar's corpse and grace his speech tending to caesar's glories which mark antony by our permission is allowed to make i do entreat you not a man depart save i alone till antony have spoke stand ho what now lucilius is cassius near he greets me well your master pindarus in his own change or by ill officers hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done undone but if he be at hand i shall be satisfied he is not doubted a word lucilius how he received you let me be resolved thou hast described a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius when love begins to sicken and decay it useth an enforcèd ceremony there are no tricks in plain and simple faith but hollow men like horses hot at hand make gallant show and promise of their mettle but when they should endure the bloody spur they fall their crests and like deceitful jades sink in the trial comes his army on hark he is arrived march gently on to meet him stand ho speak the word along judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies and if not so how should i wrong a brother cassius be content speak your griefs softly i do know you well before the eyes of both our armies here which should perceive nothing but love from us let us not wrangle bid them move away then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs and i will give you audience lucius do you the like and let no man come to our tent till we have done our conference let lucilius and titinius guard our door you wronged yourself to write in such a case let me tell you cassius you yourself are much condemned to have an itching palm to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers the name of cassius honors this corruption and chastisement doth therefore hide his head remember march the ides of march remember did not great julius bleed for justice' sake what villain touched his body that did stab and not for justice what shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes and sell the mighty space of our large honors for so much trash as may be graspèd thus i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a roman go to you are not cassius i say you are not away slight man hear me for i will speak must i give way and room to your rash choler shall i be frighted when a madman stares all this ay more fret till your proud heart break go show your slaves how choleric you are and make your bondmen tremble must i budge must i observe you must i stand and crouch under your testy humor by the gods you shall digest the venom of your spleen though it do split you for from this day forth i'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter when you are waspish you say you are a better soldier let it appear so make your vaunting true and it shall please me well for mine own part i shall be glad to learn of noble men if you did i care not peace peace you durst not so have tempted him no for your life you durst not you have done that you should be sorry for there is no terror cassius in your threats for i am armed so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind which i respect not i did send to you for certain sums of gold which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means by heaven i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection i did send to you for gold to pay my legions which you denied me was that done like cassius should i have answered caius cassius so when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends be ready gods with all your thunderbolts dash him to pieces you did i do not till you practice them on me i do not like your faults a flatterer's would not though they do appear as huge as high olympus sheathe your dagger be angry when you will it shall have scope do what you will dishonor shall be humor o cassius you are yokèd with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire who much enforcèd shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again when i spoke that i was ill tempered too and my heart too what's the matter yes cassius and from henceforth when you are over earnest with your brutus he'll think your mother chides and leave you so get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence i'll know his humor when he knows his time what should the wars do with these jigging fools  companion hence lucilius and titinius bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight lucius a bowl of wine o cassius i am sick of many griefs no man bears sorrow better portia is dead she is dead impatient of my absence and grief that young octavius with mark antony have made themselves so strong for with her death that tidings came with this she fell distract and her attendants absent swallowed fire even so speak no more of her give me a bowl of wine  in this i bury all unkindness cassius come in titinius welcome good messala now sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities no more i pray you  messala i have here receivèd letters that young octavius and mark antony come down upon us with a mighty power bending their expedition toward philippi with what addition therein our letters do not well agree mine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions cicero being one no messala nothing messala why ask you hear you aught of her in yours now as you are a roman tell me true why farewell portia we must die messala with meditating that she must die once i have the patience to endure it now well to our work alive what do you think of marching to philippi presently your reason good reasons must of force give place to better the people 'twixt philippi and this ground do stand but in a forced affection for they have grudged us contribution the enemy marching along by them by them shall make a fuller number up come on refreshed new added and encouraged from which advantage shall we cut him off if at philippi we do face him there these people at our back under your pardon you must note besides that we have tried the utmost of our friends our legions are brim full our cause is ripe the enemy increaseth every day we at the height are ready to decline there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures the deep of night is crept upon our talk and nature must obey necessity which we will niggard with a little rest there is no more to say lucius my gown farewell good messala  good night titinius noble noble cassius good night and good repose everything is well good night good brother farewell everyone give me the gown where is thy instrument what thou speak'st drowsily poor knave i blame thee not thou art o'erwatched call claudius and some other of my men i'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent i pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep it may be i shall raise you by and by on business to my brother cassius i will not have it so lie down good sirs it may be i shall otherwise bethink me look lucius here's the book i sought for so i put it in the pocket of my gown bear with me good boy i am much forgetful canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile and touch thy instrument a strain or two it does my boy i trouble thee too much but thou art willing i should not urge thy duty past thy might i know young bloods look for a time of rest it was well done and thou shalt sleep again i will not hold thee long if i do live i will be good to thee this is a sleepy tune o murd'rous slumber layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy that plays thee music gentle knave good night i will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee if thou dost nod thou break'st thy instrument i'll take it from thee and good boy good night let me see let me see is not the leaf turned down where i left reading here it is i think how ill this taper burns ha who comes here  i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition it comes upon me art thou any thing art thou some god some angel or some devil that mak'st my blood cold and my hair to stare speak to me what thou art why com'st thou well then i shall see thee again why i will see thee at philippi then now i have taken heart thou vanishest ill spirit i would hold more talk with thee  boy lucius varro claudius sirs awake claudius he thinks he still is at his instrument lucius awake didst thou dream lucius that thou so criedst out yes that thou didst didst thou see anything sleep again lucius sirrah claudius fellow thou awake why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep ay saw you anything go and commend me to my brother cassius bid him set on his powers betimes before and we will follow they stand and would have parley words before blows is it so countrymen good words are better than bad strokes octavius o yes and soundless too for you have stolen their buzzing antony and very wisely threat before you sting caesar thou canst not die by traitors' hands unless thou bring'st them with thee o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain young man thou couldst not die more honorable ho lucilius hark a word with you even so lucilius even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below no cassius no think not thou noble roman that ever brutus will go bound to rome he bears too great a mind but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun and whether we shall meet again i know not therefore our everlasting farewell take forever and forever farewell cassius if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made why then lead on o that a man might know the end of this day's business ere it come but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known come ho away ride ride messala ride and give these bills unto the legions on the other side let them set on at once for i perceive but cold demeanor in octavius' wing and sudden push gives them the overthrow ride ride messala let them all come down where where messala doth his body lie titinius' face is upward o julius caesar thou art mighty yet thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords in our own proper entrails are yet two romans living such as these  the last of all the romans fare thee well it is impossible that ever rome should breed thy fellow friends i owe more tears to this dead man than you shall see me pay  i shall find time cassius i shall find time  come therefore and to thasos send his body his funerals shall not be in our camp lest it discomfort us lucilius come  and come young cato let us to the field  labeo and flavius set our battles on 'tis three o'clock and romans yet ere night we shall try fortune in a second fight yet countrymen o yet hold up your heads come poor remains of friends rest on this rock sit thee down clitus slaying is the word it is a deed in fashion hark thee clitus peace then no words hark thee dardanus come hither good volumnius list a word why this volumnius the ghost of caesar hath appeared to me two several times by night at sardis once and this last night here in philippi fields i know my hour is come nay i am sure it is volumnius thou seest the world volumnius how it goes our enemies have beat us to the pit it is more worthy to leap in ourselves than tarry till they push us good volumnius thou know'st that we two went to school together even for that our love of old i prithee hold thou my sword hilts whilst i run on it farewell to you and you and you volumnius  strato thou hast been all this while asleep farewell to thee too strato countrymen my heart doth joy that yet in all my life i found no man but he was true to me i shall have glory by this losing day more than octavius and mark antony by this vile conquest shall attain unto so fare you well at once for brutus' tongue hath almost ended his life's history night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest that have but labored to attain this hour hence i will follow i prithee strato stay thou by thy lord thou art a fellow of a good respect thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it hold then my sword and turn away thy face while i do run upon it wilt thou strato farewell good strato caesar now be still i killed not thee with half so good a will
