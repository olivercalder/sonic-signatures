proceed solinus to procure my fall and by the doom of death end woes and all yet this my comfort when your words are done my woes end likewise with the evening sun a heavier task could not have been imposed than i to speak my griefs unspeakable yet that the world may witness that my end was wrought by nature not by vile offense i'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave in syracusa was i born and wed unto a woman happy but for me and by me had not our hap been bad with her i lived in joy our wealth increased by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamium till my factor's death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear  had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrivèd where i was there had she not been long but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons and which was strange the one so like the other as could not be distinguished but by names that very hour and in the selfsame inn a mean woman was deliverèd of such a burden male twins both alike those for their parents were exceeding poor i bought and brought up to attend my sons my wife not meanly proud of two such boys made daily motions for our home return unwilling i agreed alas too soon we came aboard a league from epidamium had we sailed before the always wind obeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm but longer did we not retain much hope for what obscurèd light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death which though myself would gladly have embraced yet the incessant weepings of my wife weeping before for what she saw must come and piteous plainings of the pretty babes that mourned for fashion ignorant what to fear forced me to seek delays for them and me and this it was for other means was none the sailors sought for safety by our boat and left the ship then sinking ripe to us my wife more careful for the latter born had fastened him unto a small spare mast such as seafaring men provide for storms to him one of the other twins was bound whilst i had been like heedful of the other the children thus disposed my wife and i fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed fastened ourselves at either end the mast and floating straight obedient to the stream was carried towards corinth as we thought at length the sun gazing upon the earth dispersed those vapors that offended us and by the benefit of his wished light the seas waxed calm and we discoverèd two ships from far making amain to us of corinth that of epidaurus this but ere they came o let me say no more gather the sequel by that went before o had the gods done so i had not now worthily termed them merciless to us for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encountered by a mighty rock which being violently borne upon our helpful ship was splitted in the midst so that in this unjust divorce of us fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in what to sorrow for her part poor soul seeming as burdenèd with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length another ship had seized on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave healthful welcome to their shipwracked guests and would have reft the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus have you heard me severed from my bliss that by misfortunes was my life prolonged to tell sad stories of my own mishaps my youngest boy and yet my eldest care at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother and importuned me that his attendant so his case was like reft of his brother but retained his name  might bear him company in the quest of him whom whilst i labored of a love to see i hazarded the loss of whom i loved five summers have i spent in farthest greece roaming clean through the bounds of asia and coasting homeward came to ephesus hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbors men but here must end the story of my life and happy were i in my timely death could all my travels warrant me they live hopeless and helpless doth egeon wend but to procrastinate his lifeless end unless the fear of death doth make me dote i see my son antipholus and dromio most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word haply i see a friend will save my life and pay the sum that may deliver me is not your name sir called antipholus and is not that your bondman dromio i am sure you both of you remember me why look you strange on me you know me well o grief hath changed me since you saw me last and careful hours with time's deformèd hand have written strange defeatures in my face but tell me yet dost thou not know my voice dromio nor thou i am sure thou dost not know my voice o time's extremity hast thou so cracked and splitted my poor tongue in seven short years that here my only son knows not my feeble key of untuned cares though now this grainèd face of mine be hid in sap consuming winter's drizzled snow and all the conduits of my blood froze up yet hath my night of life some memory my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left my dull deaf ears a little use to hear all these old witnesses i cannot err  tell me thou art my son antipholus but seven years since in syracusa boy thou know'st we parted but perhaps my son thou sham'st to acknowledge me in misery if i dream not thou art emilia if thou art she tell me where is that son that floated with thee on the fatal raft
