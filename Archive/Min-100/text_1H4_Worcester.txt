our house my sovereign liege little deserves the scourge of greatness to be used on it and that same greatness too which our own hands have holp to make so portly who struck this heat up after i was gone i cannot blame him was not he proclaimed by richard that dead is the next of blood and for whose death we in the world's wide mouth live scandalized and foully spoken of peace cousin say no more and now i will unclasp a secret book and to your quick conceiving discontents i'll read you matter deep and dangerous as full of peril and adventurous spirit as to o'erwalk a current roaring loud on the unsteadfast footing of a spear he apprehends a world of figures here but not the form of what he should attend  good cousin give me audience for a while those same noble scots that are your prisoners  you start away and lend no ear unto my purposes those prisoners you shall keep  hear you cousin a word farewell kinsman i'll talk to you when you are better tempered to attend nay if you have not to it again we will stay your leisure then once more to your scottish prisoners deliver them up without their ransom straight and make the douglas' son your only mean for powers in scotland which for divers reasons which i shall send you written be assured will easily be granted you my lord your son in scotland being thus employed shall secretly into the bosom creep of that same noble prelate well beloved the archbishop true who bears hard his brother's death at bristol the lord scroop i speak not this in estimation as what i think might be but what i know is ruminated plotted and set down and only stays but to behold the face of that occasion that shall bring it on and so they shall and 'tis no little reason bids us speed to save our heads by raising of a head for bear ourselves as even as we can the king will always think him in our debt and think we think ourselves unsatisfied till he hath found a time to pay us home and see already how he doth begin to make us strangers to his looks of love cousin farewell no further go in this than i by letters shall direct your course when time is ripe which will be suddenly i'll steal to glendower and lord mortimer where you and douglas and our powers at once as i will fashion it shall happily meet to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms which now we hold at much uncertainty yea but a little charge will trench him here and on this north side win this cape of land and then he runs straight and even in faith my lord you are too willful blame and since your coming hither have done enough to put him quite besides his patience you must needs learn lord to amend this fault though sometimes it show greatness courage blood  and that's the dearest grace it renders you  yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage defect of manners want of government pride haughtiness opinion and disdain the least of which haunting a nobleman loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain upon the beauty of all parts besides beguiling them of commendation i prithee tell me doth he keep his bed i would the state of time had first been whole ere he by sickness had been visited his health was never better worth than now your father's sickness is a maim to us but yet i would your father had been here the quality and hair of our attempt brooks no division it will be thought by some that know not why he is away that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike of our proceedings kept the earl from hence and think how such an apprehension may turn the tide of fearful faction and breed a kind of question in our cause for well you know we of the off'ring side must keep aloof from strict arbitrament and stop all sight holes every loop from whence the eye of reason may pry in upon us this absence of your father's draws a curtain that shows the ignorant a kind of fear before not dreamt of ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound it may not be good cousin be advised stir not tonight the number of the king exceedeth ours for god's sake cousin stay till all come in hear me my liege for mine own part i could be well content to entertain the lag end of my life with quiet hours for i protest i have not sought the day of this dislike it pleased your majesty to turn your looks of favor from myself and all our house and yet i must remember you my lord we were the first and dearest of your friends for you my staff of office did i break in richard's time and posted day and night to meet you on the way and kiss your hand when yet you were in place and in account nothing so strong and fortunate as i it was myself my brother and his son that brought you home and boldly did outdare the dangers of the time you swore to us and you did swear that oath at doncaster that you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state nor claim no further than your new fall'n right the seat of gaunt dukedom of lancaster to this we swore our aid but in short space it rained down fortune show'ring on your head and such a flood of greatness fell on you  what with our help what with the absent king what with the injuries of a wanton time the seeming sufferances that you had borne and the contrarious winds that held the king so long in his unlucky irish wars that all in england did repute him dead  and from this swarm of fair advantages you took occasion to be quickly wooed to gripe the general sway into your hand forgot your oath to us at doncaster and being fed by us you used us so as that ungentle gull the cuckoo's bird useth the sparrow did oppress our nest grew by our feeding to so great a bulk that even our love durst not come near your sight for fear of swallowing but with nimble wing we were enforced for safety sake to fly out of your sight and raise this present head whereby we stand oppos√®d by such means as you yourself have forged against yourself by unkind usage dangerous countenance and violation of all faith and troth sworn to us in your younger enterprise o no my nephew must not know sir richard the liberal and kind offer of the king then are we all undone it is not possible it cannot be the king should keep his word in loving us he will suspect us still and find a time to punish this offense in other faults suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes for treason is but trusted like the fox who never so tame so cherished and locked up will have a wild trick of his ancestors look how we can or sad or merrily interpretation will misquote our looks and we shall feed like oxen at a stall the better cherished still the nearer death my nephew's trespass may be well forgot it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood and an adopted name of privilege  a harebrained hotspur governed by a spleen all his offenses live upon my head and on his father's we did train him on and his corruption being ta'en from us we as the spring of all shall pay for all therefore good cousin let not harry know in any case the offer of the king the king will bid you battle presently there is no seeming mercy in the king i told him gently of our grievances of his oath breaking which he mended thus by now forswearing that he is forsworn he calls us rebels traitors and will scourge with haughty arms this hateful name in us the prince of wales stepped forth before the king and nephew challenged you to single fight what i have done my safety urged me to and i embrace this fortune patiently since not to be avoided it falls on me
