i thank your grace healthful and ever since a fresh admirer of what i saw there 'twixt guynes and arde i was then present saw them salute on horseback beheld them when they lighted how they clung in their embracement as they grew together  which had they what four throned ones could have weighed such a compounded one then you lost the view of earthly glory men might say till this time pomp was single but now married to one above itself each following day became the next day's master till the last made former wonders its today the french all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods shone down the english and tomorrow they made britain india every man that stood showed like a mine their dwarfish pages were as cherubins all gilt the madams too not used to toil did almost sweat to bear the pride upon them that their very labor was to them as a painting now this masque was cried incomparable and th' ensuing night made it a fool and beggar the two kings equal in luster were now best now worst as presence did present them him in eye still him in praise and being present both 'twas said they saw but one and no discerner durst wag his tongue in censure when these suns  for so they phrase 'em by their heralds challenged the noble spirits to arms they did perform beyond thought's compass that former fabulous story being now seen possible enough got credit that bevis was believed as i belong to worship and affect in honor honesty the tract of everything would by a good discourser lose some life which action's self was tongue to all was royal to the disposing of it naught rebelled order gave each thing view the office did distinctly his full function one certes that promises no element in such a business all this was ordered by the good discretion of the right reverend cardinal of york surely sir there's in him stuff that puts him to these ends for being not propped by ancestry whose grace chalks successors their way nor called upon for high feats done to th' crown neither allied to eminent assistants but spiderlike out of his self drawing web he gives us note the force of his own merit makes his way  a gift that heaven gives for him which buys a place next to the king grievingly i think the peace between the french and us not values the cost that did conclude it which is budded out for france hath flawed the league and hath attached our merchants' goods at bordeaux marry is 't like it your grace the state takes notice of the private difference betwixt you and the cardinal i advise you  and take it from a heart that wishes towards you honor and plenteous safety that you read the cardinal's malice and his potency together to consider further that what his high hatred would effect wants not a minister in his power you know his nature that he's revengeful and i know his sword hath a sharp edge it's long and 't may be said it reaches far and where 'twill not extend thither he darts it bosom up my counsel you'll find it wholesome lo where comes that rock that i advise your shunning what are you chafed ask god for temp'rance that's th' appliance only which your disease requires stay my lord and let your reason with your choler question what 'tis you go about to climb steep hills requires slow pace at first anger is like a full hot horse who being allowed his way self mettle tires him not a man in england can advise me like you be to yourself as you would to your friend be advised heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself we may outrun by violent swiftness that which we run at and lose by overrunning know you not the fire that mounts the liquor till 't run o'er in seeming to augment it wastes it be advised i say again there is no english soul more stronger to direct you than yourself if with the sap of reason you would quench or but allay the fire of passion say not treasonous faith and so it did i am sorry to hear this of him and could wish he were something mistaken in 't not almost appears  it doth appear for upon these taxations the clothiers all not able to maintain the many to them longing have put off the spinsters carders fullers weavers who unfit for other life compelled by hunger and lack of other means in desperate manner daring th' event to th' teeth are all in uproar and danger serves among them well met my lord chamberlain what's the cause 'tis so this is the cardinal's doing the king cardinal that blind priest like the eldest son of fortune turns what he list the king will know him one day how holily he works in all his business and with what zeal for now he has cracked the league between us and the emperor the queen's great nephew he dives into the king's soul and there scatters dangers doubts wringing of the conscience fears and despairs and all these for his marriage and out of all these to restore the king he counsels a divorce a loss of her that like a jewel has hung twenty years about his neck yet never lost her luster of her that loves him with that excellence that angels love good men with even of her that when the greatest stroke of fortune falls will bless the king and is not this course pious we had need pray and heartily for our deliverance or this imperious man will work us all from princes into pages all men's honors lie like one lump before him to be fashioned into what pitch he please let's in and with some other business put the king from these sad thoughts that work too much upon him  my lord you'll bear us company thanks my good lord chamberlain pray god he be not angry a gracious king that pardons all offenses malice ne'er meant our breach of duty this way is business of estate in which we come to know your royal pleasure this priest has no pride in him if it do i'll venture one have at him if you will now unite in your complaints and force them with a constancy the cardinal cannot stand under them if you omit the offer of this time i cannot promise but that you shall sustain more new disgraces with these you bear already o fear him not his spell in that is out the king hath found matter against him that forever mars the honey of his language no he's settled not to come off in his displeasure believe it this is true in the divorce his contrary proceedings are all unfolded wherein he appears as i would wish mine enemy all men's marry amen but my lord when returns cranmer this same cranmer's a worthy fellow and hath ta'en much pain in the king's business so i hear observe observe he's moody he's discontented he is vexed at something my lord we have stood here observing him some strange commotion is in his brain he bites his lip and starts stops on a sudden looks upon the ground then lays his finger on his temple straight springs out into fast gait then stops again strikes his breast hard and anon he casts his eye against the moon in most strange postures we have seen him set himself it's heaven's will some spirit put this paper in the packet to bless your eye withal hear the king's pleasure cardinal who commands you to render up the great seal presently into our hands and to confine yourself to asher house my lord of winchester's till you hear further from his highness those articles my lord are in the king's hand but thus much they are foul ones then that in all you writ to rome or else to foreign princes ego et rex meus was still inscribed in which you brought the king to be your servant and so we'll leave you to your meditations how to live better for your stubborn answer about the giving back the great seal to us the king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you so fare you well my little good lord cardinal who waits there we are do you think my lords the king will suffer but the little finger of this man to be vexed
