i have antiochus and with a soul emboldened with the glory of her praise think death no hazard in this enterprise see where she comes appareled like the spring graces her subjects and her thoughts the king of every virtue gives renown to men her face the book of praises where is read nothing but curious pleasures as from thence sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath could never be her mild companion you gods that made me man and sway in love that have inflamed desire in my breast to taste the fruit of yon celestial tree or die in th' adventure be my helps as i am son and servant to your will to compass such a boundless happiness that would be son to great antiochus antiochus i thank thee who hath taught my frail mortality to know itself and by those fearful objects to prepare this body like to them to what i must for death remembered should be like a mirror who tells us life's but breath to trust it error i'll make my will then and as sick men do who know the world see heaven but feeling woe gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did so i bequeath a happy peace to you and all good men as every prince should do my riches to the earth from whence they came but my unspotted fire of love to you  thus ready for the way of life or death i wait the sharpest blow like a bold champion i assume the lists nor ask advice of any other thought but faithfulness and courage i am no viper yet i feed on mother's flesh which did me breed i sought a husband in which labor i found that kindness in a father he's father son and husband mild i mother wife and yet his child how they may be and yet in two as you will live resolve it you sharp physic is the last but o you powers that gives heaven countless eyes to view men's acts why cloud they not their sights perpetually if this be true which makes me pale to read it fair glass of light i loved you and could still were not this glorious casket stored with ill but i must tell you now my thoughts revolt for he's no man on whom perfections wait that knowing sin within will touch the gate you are a fair viol and your sense the strings who fingered to make man his lawful music would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken but being played upon before your time hell only danceth at so harsh a chime good sooth i care not for you great king few love to hear the sins they love to act 'twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it who has a book of all that monarchs do he's more secure to keep it shut than shown for vice repeated is like the wand'ring wind blows dust in others' eyes to spread itself and yet the end of all is bought thus dear the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear to stop the air would hurt them the blind mole casts copped hills towards heaven to tell the earth is thronged by man's oppression and the poor worm doth die for 't kings are earth's gods in vice their law's their will and if jove stray who dares say jove doth ill it is enough you know and it is fit what being more known grows worse to smother it all love the womb that their first being bred then give my tongue like leave to love my head how courtesy would seem to cover sin when what is done is like an hypocrite the which is good in nothing but in sight if it be true that i interpret false then were it certain you were not so bad as with foul incest to abuse your soul where now you're both a father and a son by your untimely claspings with your child which pleasures fits a husband not a father and she an eater of her mother's flesh by the defiling of her parents' bed and both like serpents are who though they feed on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men blush not in actions blacker than the night will 'schew no course to keep them from the light one sin i know another doth provoke murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke poison and treason are the hands of sin ay and the targets to put off the shame then lest my life be cropped to keep you clear by flight i'll shun the danger which i fear let none disturb us why should this change of thoughts the sad companion dull eyed melancholy be my so used a guest as not an hour in the day's glorious walk or peaceful night the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them and danger which i feared is at antioch whose arm seems far too short to hit me here yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits nor yet the other's distance comfort me then it is thus the passions of the mind that have their first conception by misdread have after nourishment and life by care and what was first but fear what might be done grows elder now and cares it be not done and so with me the great antiochus 'gainst whom i am too little to contend since he's so great can make his will his act will think me speaking though i swear to silence nor boots it me to say i honor him if he suspect i may dishonor him and what may make him blush in being known he'll stop the course by which it might be known with hostile forces he'll o'er spread the land and with th' ostent of war will look so huge amazement shall drive courage from the state our men be vanquished ere they do resist and subjects punished that ne'er thought offense which care of them not pity of myself who am no more but as the tops of trees which fence the roots they grow by and defend them makes both my body pine and soul to languish and punish that before that he would punish all leave us else but let your cares o'erlook what shipping and what lading's in our haven and then return to us helicanus thou hast moved us what seest thou in our looks if there be such a dart in princes' frowns how durst thy tongue move anger to our face thou knowest i have power to take thy life from thee rise prithee rise sit down thou art no flatterer i thank thee for 't and heaven forbid that kings should let their ears hear their faults hid fit counselor and servant for a prince who by thy wisdom makes a prince thy servant what wouldst thou have me do thou speak'st like a physician helicanus that ministers a potion unto me that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself attend me then i went to antioch where as thou know'st against the face of death i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty from whence an issue i might propagate are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder the rest hark in thine ear as black as incest which by my knowledge found the sinful father seemed not to strike but smooth but thou know'st this 'tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss which fear so grew in me i hither fled under the covering of a careful night who seemed my good protector and being here bethought me what was past what might succeed i knew him tyrannous and tyrants' fears decrease not but grow faster than the years and should he doubt as no doubt he doth that i should open to the list'ning air how many worthy princes' bloods were shed to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope to lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms and make pretense of wrong that i have done him when all for mine if i may call 't offense must feel war's blow who spares not innocence which love to all of which thyself art one who now reproved'st me for 't  drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks musings into my mind with thousand doubts how i might stop this tempest ere it came and finding little comfort to relieve them i thought it princely charity to grieve for them i do not doubt thy faith but should he wrong my liberties in my absence tyre i now look from thee then and to tarsus intend my travel where i'll hear from thee and by whose letters i'll dispose myself the care i had and have of subjects' good on thee i lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it i'll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath who shuns not to break one will crack both but in our orbs we'll live so round and safe that time of both this truth shall ne'er convince thou showed'st a subject's shine i a true prince lord governor for so we hear you are let not our ships and number of our men be like a beacon fired t' amaze your eyes we have heard your miseries as far as tyre and seen the desolation of your streets nor come we to add sorrow to your tears but to relieve them of their heavy load and these our ships you happily may think are like the trojan horse was stuffed within with bloody veins expecting overthrow are stored with corn to make your needy bread and give them life whom hunger starved half dead arise i pray you rise we do not look for reverence but for love and harborage for ourself our ships and men which welcome we'll accept feast here awhile until our stars that frown lend us a smile yet cease your ire you angry stars of heaven wind rain and thunder remember earthly man is but a substance that must yield to you and i as fits my nature do obey you alas the seas hath cast me on the rocks washed me from shore to shore and left my breath nothing to think on but ensuing death let it suffice the greatness of your powers to have bereft a prince of all his fortunes and having thrown him from your wat'ry grave here to have death in peace is all he'll crave a pretty moral simonides how from the finny subject of the sea these fishers tell the infirmities of men and from their wat'ry empire recollect all that may men approve or men detect  peace be at your labor honest fishermen may see the sea hath cast upon your coast  a man whom both the waters and the wind in that vast tennis court hath made the ball for them to play upon entreats you pity him he asks of you that never used to beg i never practiced it what i have been i have forgot to know but what i am want teaches me to think on a man thronged up with cold my veins are chill and have no more of life than may suffice to give my tongue that heat to ask your help  which if you shall refuse when i am dead for that i am a man pray you see me buried i thank you sir i did but crave why are your beggars whipped then how well this honest mirth becomes their labor not well the good simonides do you call him he is a happy king since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government how far is his court distant from this shore were my fortunes equal to my desires i could wish to make one there an armor friends i pray you let me see it thanks fortune yet that after all thy crosses thou givest me somewhat to repair myself and though it was mine own part of my heritage which my dead father did bequeath to me with this strict charge even as he left his life keep it my pericles it hath been a shield 'twixt me and death and pointed to this brace for that it saved me keep it in like necessity  the which the gods protect thee from may 't defend thee it kept where i kept i so dearly loved it till the rough seas that spares not any man took it in rage though calmed have given 't again i thank thee for 't my shipwrack now's no ill since i have here my father gave in his will to beg of you kind friends this coat of worth for it was sometime target to a king i know it by this mark he loved me dearly and for his sake i wish the having of it and that you'd guide me to your sovereign's court where with it i may appear a gentleman and if that ever my low fortune's better i'll pay your bounties till then rest your debtor i'll show the virtue i have borne in arms believe 't i will by your furtherance i am clothed in steel and spite of all the rupture of the sea this jewel holds his biding on my arm unto thy value i will mount myself upon a courser whose delightful steps shall make the gazer joy to see him tread only my friend i yet am unprovided of a pair of bases then honor be but a goal to my will this day i'll rise or else add ill to ill 'tis more by fortune lady than my merit some other is more fit you are right courteous knights yon king's to me like to my father's picture which tells in that glory once he was  had princes sit like stars about his throne and he the sun for them to reverence none that beheld him but like lesser lights did vail their crowns to his supremacy where now his son's like a glowworm in the night the which hath fire in darkness none in light whereby i see that time's the king of men he's both their parent and he is their grave and gives them what he will not what they crave i thank him i thank both him and you and pledge him freely a gentleman of tyre my name pericles my education been in arts and arms who looking for adventures in the world was by the rough seas reft of ships and men and after shipwrack driven upon this shore in those that practice them they are my lord i am at your grace's pleasure all fortune to the good simonides it is your grace's pleasure to commend not my desert the worst of all her scholars my good lord a most virtuous princess as a fair day in summer wondrous fair i am unworthy for her schoolmaster what's here a letter that she loves the knight of tyre 'tis the king's subtlety to have my life  o seek not to entrap me gracious lord a stranger and distressèd gentleman that never aimed so high to love your daughter but bent all offices to honor her by the gods i have not never did thought of mine levy offense nor never did my actions yet commence a deed might gain her love or your displeasure traitor even in his throat unless it be the king that calls me traitor i return the lie my actions are as noble as my thoughts that never relished of a base descent i came unto your court for honor's cause and not to be a rebel to her state and he that otherwise accounts of me this sword shall prove he's honor's enemy then as you are as virtuous as fair resolve your angry father if my tongue did e'er solicit or my hand subscribe to any syllable that made love to you even as my life my blood that fosters it yes if 't please your majesty the god of this great vast rebuke these surges which wash both heaven and hell

first thy loss is more than can thy portage quit with all thou canst find here now the good gods throw their best eyes upon 't courage enough i do not fear the flaw it hath done to me the worst yet for the love of this poor infant this fresh new seafarer i would it would be quiet that's your superstition as you think meet most wretched queen a terrible childbed hast thou had my dear no light no fire th' unfriendly elements forgot thee utterly nor have i time to give thee hallowed to thy grave but straight must cast thee scarcely coffined in the ooze where for a monument upon thy bones and e'er remaining lamps the belching whale and humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse lying with simple shells o lychorida bid nestor bring me spices ink and paper my casket and my jewels and bid nicander bring me the satin coffin lay the babe upon the pillow hie thee whiles i say a priestly farewell to her suddenly woman i thank thee mariner say what coast is this thither gentle mariner alter

depend hereafter come my lord hum ha my fortunes parentage good parentage to equal mine was it not thus what say you i do think so pray you turn your eyes upon me you're like something that what countrywoman here of these shores i am great with woe and shall deliver weeping my dearest wife was like this maid and such a one my daughter might have been my queen's square brows her stature to an inch as wandlike straight as silver voiced her eyes as jewel like and cased as richly in pace another juno who starves the ears she feeds and makes them hungry the more she gives them speech  where do you live where were you bred and how achieved you these endowments which you make more rich to owe prithee speak falseness cannot come from thee for thou lookest modest as justice and thou seemest a palace for the crownèd truth to dwell in i will believe thee and make my senses credit thy relation to points that seem impossible for thou lookest like one i loved indeed what were thy friends didst thou not say when i did push thee back  which was when i perceived thee that thou cam'st from good descending report thy parentage i think thou said'st thou hadst been tossed from wrong to injury and that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine if both were opened tell thy story if thine considered prove the thousand part of my endurance thou art a man and i have suffered like a girl yet thou
