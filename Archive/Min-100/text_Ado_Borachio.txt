i came yonder from a great supper the prince your brother is royally entertained by leonato and i can give you intelligence of an intended marriage marry it is your brother's right hand even he marry on hero the daughter and heir of leonato being entertained for a perfumer as i was smoking a musty room comes me the prince and claudio hand in hand in sad conference i whipped me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo hero for himself and having obtained her give her to count claudio we'll wait upon your lordship and that is claudio i know him by his bearing so did i too and he swore he would marry her tonight yea my lord but i can cross it not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in the favor of margaret the waiting gentlewoman to hero i can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window the poison of that lies in you to temper go you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honor in marrying the renowned claudio whose estimation do you mightily hold up to a contaminated stale such a one as hero proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio to undo hero and kill leonato look you for any other issue go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio as in love of your brother's honor who hath made this match and his friend's reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid that you have discovered thus they will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me call margaret hero hear margaret term me claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me what conrade conrade i say mass and my elbow itched i thought there would a scab follow stand thee close then under this penthouse for it drizzles rain and i will like a true drunkard utter all to thee therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones poor ones may make what price they will that shows thou art unconfirmed thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man i mean the fashion tush i may as well say the fool's the fool but seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is didst thou not hear somebody seest thou not i say what a deformed thief this fashion is how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five and thirty sometimes fashioning them like pharaoh's soldiers in the reechy painting sometimes like god bel's priests in the old church window sometimes like the shaven hercules in the smirched worm eaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as massy as his club not so neither but know that i have tonight wooed margaret the lady hero's gentlewoman by the name of hero she leans me out at her mistress' chamber window bids me a thousand times goodnight i tell this tale vilely i should first tell thee how the prince claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master don john saw afar off in the orchard this amiable amiable encounter two of them did the prince and claudio but the devil my master knew she was margaret and partly by his oaths which first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villainy which did confirm any slander that don john had made away went claudio enraged swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw o'ernight and send her home again without a husband we are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken up of these men's bills borachio yea sir we hope sir i say to you we are none master constable  sweet prince let me go no farther to mine answer do you hear me and let this count kill me i have deceived even your very eyes what your wisdoms could not discover these shallow fools have brought to light who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how don john your brother incensed me to slander the lady hero how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court margaret in hero's garments how you disgraced her when you should marry her my villainy they have upon record which i had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame the lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation and briefly i desire nothing but the reward of a villain yea and paid me richly for the practice of it if you would know your wronger look on me yea even i alone no by my soul she was not nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me but always hath been just and virtuous in anything that i do know by her
