the duke does greet you general and he requires your haste post haste appearance even on the instant something from cyprus as i may divine it is a business of some heat the galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one another's heels and many of the consuls raised and met are at the duke's already you have been hotly called for when being not at your lodging to be found the senate hath sent about three several quests to search you out ancient what makes he here i do not understand to who here comes another troop to seek for you thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle that so approve the moor o let the heavens give him defense against the elements for i have lost him on a dangerous sea his bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot of very expert and approved allowance therefore my hopes not surfeited to death stand in bold cure what noise my hopes do shape him for the governor i pray you sir go forth and give us truth who 'tis that is arrived most fortunately he hath achieved a maid that paragons description and wild fame one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens and in th' essential vesture of creation does tire the ingener how now who has put in 'has had most favorable and happy speed tempests themselves high seas and howling winds the guttered rocks and congregated sands traitors ensteeped to clog the guiltless keel as having sense of beauty do omit their mortal natures letting go safely by the divine desdemona she that i spake of our great captain's captain left in the conduct of the bold iago whose footing here anticipates our thoughts a sennight's speed great jove othello guard and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath that he may bless this bay with his tall ship make love's quick pants in desdemona's arms give renewed fire to our extincted spirits and bring all cyprus comfort o behold the riches of the ship is come on shore you men of cyprus let her have your knees hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven before behind thee and on every hand enwheel thee round he is not yet arrived nor know i aught but that he's well and will be shortly here the great contention of sea and skies parted our fellowship but hark a sail see for the news good ancient you are welcome welcome mistress let it not gall your patience good iago that i extend my manners 'tis my breeding that gives me this bold show of courtesy he speaks home madam you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar 'tis truly so lo where he comes iago hath direction what to do but notwithstanding with my personal eye will i look to 't welcome iago we must to the watch she's a most exquisite lady indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature an inviting eye and yet methinks right modest she is indeed perfection not tonight good iago i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment i have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here i am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more where are they i'll do 't but it dislikes me 'fore god they have given me a rouse already 'fore god an excellent song is your englishman so exquisite in his drinking to the health of our general 'fore god this is a more exquisite song than the other no for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things well god's above all and there be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved for mine own part no offense to the general nor any man of quality i hope to be saved ay but by your leave not before me the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient let's have no more of this let's to our affairs god forgive us our sins gentlemen let's look to our business do not think gentlemen i am drunk this is my ancient this is my right hand and this is my left i am not drunk now i can stand well enough and i speak well enough why very well then you must not think then that i am drunk zounds you rogue you rascal a knave teach me my duty i'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle dost thou prate rogue let me go sir or i'll knock you o'er the mazard drunk i pray you pardon me i cannot speak ay past all surgery reputation reputation reputation o i have lost my reputation i have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial my reputation iago my reputation i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with one's own shadow o thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil i know not i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil i have well approved it sir i drunk you advise me well i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here good night honest iago masters play here i will content your pains something that's brief and bid good morrow general dost thou hear mine honest friend prithee keep up thy quillets there's a poor piece of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring tell her there's one cassio entreats her a little favor of speech wilt thou do this do good my friend in happy time iago why no the day had broke before we parted i have made bold iago to send in to your wife my suit to her is that she will to virtuous desdemona procure me some access i humbly thank you for 't i never knew a florentine more kind and honest yet i beseech you if you think fit or that it may be done give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemon alone i am much bound to you bounteous madam whatever shall become of michael cassio he's never anything but your true servant ay but lady that policy may either last so long or feed upon such nice and waterish diet or breed itself so out of circumstance that i being absent and my place supplied my general will forget my love and service madam i'll take my leave madam not now i am very ill at ease unfit for mine own purposes madam my former suit i do beseech you that by your virtuous means i may again exist and be a member of his love whom i with all the office of my heart entirely honor i would not be delayed if my offense be of such mortal kind that nor my service past nor present sorrows nor purposed merit in futurity can ransom me into his love again but to know so must be my benefit so shall i clothe me in a forced content and shut myself up in some other course to fortune's alms i humbly thank your ladyship what make you from home how is 't with you my most fair bianca i' faith sweet love i was coming to your house pardon me bianca i have this while with leaden thoughts been pressed but i shall in a more continuate time strike off this score of absence sweet bianca take me this work out go to woman throw

me in every place i was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain venetians and thither comes the bauble by this hand she falls thus about my neck so hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so shakes and pulls me ha ha ha well i must leave her company 'tis such another fitchew marry a perfumed one what do you mean by this haunting of me how now my sweet bianca how now how now faith i must

forever help ho murder murder o help ho light a surgeon what ho no watch no passage murder murder o help here here for heaven's sake help me iago o i am spoiled undone by villains give me some help i think that one of them is hereabout and cannot make away that's one of them my leg is cut in two no none in the world nor do i know the man o heavens forfend dear general i never gave you cause most heathenish and most gross i found it in my chamber and he himself confessed it but even now that there he dropped it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire there is besides in roderigo's letter how he upbraids iago that he made him brave me upon the watch whereon it came that i was cast and even but now he spake after long seeming dead iago hurt him iago set him on this did i fear but thought he had no weapon for he was great of heart
