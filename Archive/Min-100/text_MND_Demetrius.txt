relent sweet hermia and lysander yield thy crazèd title to my certain right i love thee not therefore pursue me not where is lysander and fair hermia the one i'll stay the other stayeth me thou told'st me they were stol'n unto this wood and here am i and wood within this wood because i cannot meet my hermia hence get thee gone and follow me no more do i entice you do i speak you fair or rather do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not nor i cannot love you tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit for i am sick when i do look on thee you do impeach your modesty too much to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not to trust the opportunity of night and the ill counsel of a desert place with the rich worth of your virginity i'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts i will not stay thy questions let me go or if thou follow me do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood i charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus stay on thy peril i alone will go o why rebuke you him that loves you so lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe so should the murdered look and so should i pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty yet you the murderer look as bright as clear as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere i had rather give his carcass to my hounds you spend your passion on a misprised mood i am not guilty of lysander's blood nor is he dead for aught that i can tell an if i could what should i get therefor there is no following her in this fierce vein here therefore for a while i will remain so sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrout sleep doth sorrow owe which now in some slight measure it will pay if for his tender here i make some stay o helen goddess nymph perfect divine to what my love shall i compare thine eyne crystal is muddy o how ripe in show thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow that pure congealèd white high taurus' snow fanned with the eastern wind turns to a crow when thou hold'st up thy hand o let me kiss this princess of pure white this seal of bliss lysander keep thy hermia i will none if e'er i loved her all that love is gone my heart to her but as guest wise sojourned and now to helen is it home returned there to remain disparage not the faith thou dost not know lest to thy peril thou aby it dear look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear if she cannot entreat i can compel i say i love thee more than he can do quick come no no he'll seem to break loose take on as you would follow but yet come not you are a tame man go i would i had your bond for i perceive a weak bond holds you i'll not trust your word no sir she shall not though you take her part you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services let her alone speak not of helena take not her part for if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her thou shalt aby it follow nay i'll go with thee cheek by jowl lysander speak again thou runaway thou coward art thou fled speak in some bush where dost thou hide thy head yea art thou there abide me if thou dar'st for well i wot thou runn'st before me shifting every place and dar'st not stand nor look me in the face where art thou now nay then thou mock'st me thou shalt buy this dear if ever i thy face by daylight see now go thy way faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed by day's approach look to be visited my lord fair helen told me of their stealth of this their purpose hither to this wood and i in fury hither followed them fair helena in fancy following me but my good lord i wot not by what power but by some power it is my love to hermia melted as the snow seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud which in my childhood i did dote upon and all the faith the virtue of my heart the object and the pleasure of mine eye is only helena to her my lord was i betrothed ere i saw hermia but like a sickness did i loathe this food but as in health come to my natural taste now i do wish it love it long for it and will forevermore be true to it these things seem small and undistinguishable like far off mountains turnèd into clouds are you sure that we are awake it seems to me that yet we sleep we dream do not you think the duke was here and bid us follow him why then we are awake let's follow him and by the way let us recount our dreams no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse my lord no remedy my lord when walls are so willful to hear without warning the very best at a beast my lord that e'er i saw not so my lord for his valor cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose he should have worn the horns on his head he dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff why all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon but silence here comes thisbe well roared lion and then came pyramus no die but an ace for him for he is but one a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which thisbe is the better he for a man god warrant us she for a woman god bless us and thus she means videlicet  ay and wall too
