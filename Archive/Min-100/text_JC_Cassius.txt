fellow come from the throng look upon caesar will you go see the order of the course i pray you do brutus i do observe you now of late i have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as i was wont to have you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you then brutus i have much mistook your passion by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value worthy cogitations tell me good brutus can you see your face 'tis just and it is very much lamented brutus that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow i have heard where many of the best respect in rome except immortal caesar speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this age's yoke have wished that noble brutus had his eyes therefore good brutus be prepared to hear and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection i your glass will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of and be not jealous on me gentle brutus were i a common laughter or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout then hold me dangerous ay do you fear it then must i think you would not have it so i know that virtue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward favor well honor is the subject of my story i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life but for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winter's cold as well as he for once upon a raw and gusty day the troubled tiber chafing with her shores caesar said to me dar'st thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point upon the word accoutered as i was i plungèd in and bade him follow so indeed he did the torrent roared and we did buffet it with lusty sinews throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy but ere we could arrive the point proposed caesar cried help me cassius or i sink i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake 'tis true this god did shake his coward lips did from their color fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his luster i did hear him groan ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books alas it cried give me some drink titinius as a sick girl you gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves men at some time are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar why should that name be sounded more than yours write them together yours is as fair a name sound them it doth become the mouth as well weigh them it is as heavy conjure with 'em brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar now in the names of all the gods at once upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great age thou art shamed rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods when went there by an age since the great flood but it was famed with more than with one man when could they say till now that talked of rome that her wide walks encompassed but one man now is it rome indeed and room enough when there is in it but one only man o you and i have heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would have brooked th' eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve and he will after his sour fashion tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today casca will tell us what the matter is they shouted thrice what was the last cry for who offered him the crown but soft i pray you what did caesar swoon no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the falling sickness did cicero say anything to what effect will you sup with me tonight casca will you dine with me tomorrow good i will expect you so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite i will do so till then think of the world well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honorable mettle may be wrought from that it is disposed therefore it is meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes for who so firm that cannot be seduced caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humor me i will this night in several hands in at his windows throw as if they came from several citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesar's ambition shall be glancèd at and after this let caesar seat him sure for we will shake him or worse days endure who's there casca by your voice a very pleasing night to honest men those that have known the earth so full of faults for my part i have walked about the streets submitting me unto the perilous night and thus unbracèd casca as you see have bared my bosom to the thunder stone and when the cross blue lightning seemed to open the breast of heaven i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it you are dull casca and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want or else you use not you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from quality and kind why old men fools and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and preformèd faculties to monstrous quality why you shall find that heaven hath infused them with these spirits to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunders lightens opens graves and roars as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruptions are let it be who it is for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors but woe the while our fathers' minds are dead and we are governed with our mothers' spirits our yoke and sufferance show us womanish i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein you gods you make the weak most strong therein you gods you tyrants do defeat nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure and why should caesar be a tyrant then poor man i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep he were no lion were not romans hinds those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar but o grief where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made but i am armed and dangers are to me indifferent there's a bargain made now know you casca i have moved already some certain of the noblest minded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honorable dangerous consequence and i do know by this they stay for me in pompey's porch for now this fearful night there is no stir or walking in the streets and the complexion of the element in favor 's like the work we have in hand most bloody fiery and most terrible 'tis cinna i do know him by his gait he is a friend cinna where haste you so no it is casca one incorporate to our attempts am i not stayed for cinna am i not stayed for tell me be you content good cinna take this paper and look you lay it in the praetor's chair where brutus may but find it and throw this in at his window set this up with wax upon old brutus' statue all this done repair to pompey's porch where you shall find us is decius brutus and trebonius there that done repair to pompey's theater come casca you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house three parts of him is ours already and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited let us go for it is after midnight and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him i think we are too bold upon your rest good morrow brutus do we trouble you yes every man of them and no man here but honors you and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you this is trebonius this decius brutus this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber shall i entreat a word and let us swear our resolution but what of cicero shall we sound him i think he will stand very strong with us then leave him out decius well urged i think it is not meet mark antony so well beloved of caesar should outlive caesar we shall find of him a shrewd contriver and you know his means if he improve them may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent let antony and caesar fall together yet i fear him for in the engrafted love he bears to caesar  the clock hath stricken three but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth today or no for he is superstitious grown of late quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies it may be these apparent prodigies the unaccustomed terror of this night and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitol today nay we will all of us be there to fetch him the morning comes upon 's we'll leave you brutus and friends disperse yourselves but all remember what you have said and show yourselves true romans what urge you your petitions in the street come to the capitol what enterprise popilius he wished today our enterprise might thrive i fear our purpose is discoverèd casca be sudden for we fear prevention  brutus what shall be done if this be known cassius or caesar never shall turn back for i will slay myself trebonius knows his time for look you brutus he draws mark antony out of the way pardon caesar caesar pardon as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber some to the common pulpits and cry out liberty freedom and enfranchisement and leave us publius lest that the people rushing on us should do your age some mischief where is antony stoop then and wash how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown so oft as that shall be so often shall the knot of us be called the men that gave their country liberty ay every man away brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome i wish we may but yet have i a mind that fears him much and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose your voice shall be as strong as any man's in the disposing of new dignities mark antony  i blame you not for praising caesar so but what compact mean you to have with us will you be pricked in number of our friends or shall we on and not depend on you brutus a word with you you know not what you do do not consent that antony speak in his funeral know you how much the people may be moved by that which he will utter i know not what may fall i like it not stand ho most noble brother you have done me wrong brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs and when you do them  pindarus bid our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground that you have wronged me doth appear in this you have condemned and noted lucius pella for taking bribes here of the sardians wherein my letters praying on his side because i knew the man was slighted off in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offense should bear his comment i an itching palm you know that you are brutus that speaks this or by the gods this speech were else your last chastisement brutus bait not me i'll not endure it you forget yourself to hedge me in i am a soldier i older in practice abler than yourself to make conditions i am urge me no more i shall forget myself have mind upon your health tempt me no farther is 't possible o you gods you gods must i endure all this is it come to this you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus i said an elder soldier not a better did i say better when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me i durst not what durst not tempt him do not presume too much upon my love i may do that i shall be sorry for i denied you not i did not he was but a fool that brought my answer back brutus hath rived my heart a friend should bear his friend's infirmities but brutus makes mine greater than they are you love me not a friendly eye could never see such faults come antony and young octavius come revenge yourselves alone on cassius for cassius is aweary of the world  hated by one he loves braved by his brother checked like a bondman all his faults observed set in a notebook learned and conned by rote to cast into my teeth o i could weep my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger and here my naked breast within a heart dearer than pluto's mine richer than gold if that thou be'st a roman take it forth i that denied thee gold will give my heart strike as thou didst at caesar for i know when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius hath cassius lived to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus when grief and blood ill tempered vexeth him do you confess so much give me your hand o brutus have not you love enough to bear with me when that rash humor which my mother gave me makes me forgetful how now what's the matter ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme bear with him brutus 'tis his fashion away away be gone and come yourselves and bring messala with you immediately to us i did not think you could have been so angry of your philosophy you make no use if you give place to accidental evils ha portia how 'scaped i killing when i crossed you so o insupportable and touching loss upon what sickness and died so o you immortal gods my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge  fill lucius till the wine o'erswell the cup i cannot drink too much of brutus' love portia art thou gone cicero one i have as much of this in art as you but yet my nature could not bear it so i do not think it good this it is 'tis better that the enemy seek us so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers doing himself offense whilst we lying still are full of rest defense and nimbleness hear me good brother  then with your will go on we'll along ourselves and meet them at philippi no more good night early tomorrow will we rise and hence o my dear brother this was an ill beginning of the night never come such division 'tween our souls let it not brutus good night my lord stand fast titinius we must out and talk antony the posture of your blows are yet unknown but for your words they rob the hybla bees and leave them honeyless flatterers now brutus thank yourself this tongue had not offended so today if cassius might have ruled a peevish schoolboy worthless of such honor joined with a masker and a reveler why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark the storm is up and all is on the hazard messala messala this is my birthday as this very day was cassius born give me thy hand messala be thou my witness that against my will as pompey was am i compelled to set upon one battle all our liberties you know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion now i change my mind and partly credit things that do presage coming from sardis on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell and there they perched gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands who to philippi here consorted us this morning are they fled away and gone and in their steads do ravens crows and kites fly o'er our heads and downward look on us as we were sickly prey their shadows seem a canopy most fatal under which our army lies ready to give up the ghost i but believe it partly for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly now most noble brutus the gods today stand friendly that we may lovers in peace lead on our days to age but since the affairs of men rests still incertain let's reason with the worst that may befall if we do lose this battle then is this the very last time we shall speak together what are you then determinèd to do then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome forever and forever farewell brutus if we do meet again we'll smile indeed if not 'tis true this parting was well made o look titinius look the villains fly myself have to mine own turned enemy this ensign here of mine was turning back i slew the coward and did take it from him this hill is far enough look look titinius are those my tents where i perceive the fire titinius if thou lovest me mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again that i may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy go pindarus get higher on that hill my sight was ever thick regard titinius and tell me what thou not'st about the field this day i breathèd first time is come round and where i did begin there shall i end my life is run his compass sirrah what news what news come down behold no more  o coward that i am to live so long to see my best friend ta'en before my face come hither sirrah in parthia did i take thee prisoner and then i swore thee saving of thy life that whatsoever i did bid thee do thou shouldst attempt it come now keep thine oath now be a freeman and with this good sword that ran through caesar's bowels search this bosom stand not to answer here take thou the hilts and when my face is covered as 'tis now guide thou the sword caesar thou art revenged even with the sword that killed thee
