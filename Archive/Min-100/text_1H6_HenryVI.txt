uncles of gloucester and of winchester the special watchmen of our english weal i would prevail if prayers might prevail to join your hearts in love and amity o what a scandal is it to our crown that two such noble peers as you should jar believe me lords my tender years can tell civil dissension is a viperous worm that gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth what tumult 's this we charge you on allegiance to ourself to hold your slaught'ring hands and keep the peace  pray uncle gloucester mitigate this strife o how this discord doth afflict my soul can you my lord of winchester behold my sighs and tears and will not once relent who should be pitiful if you be not or who should study to prefer a peace if holy churchmen take delight in broils fie uncle beaufort i have heard you preach that malice was a great and grievous sin and will not you maintain the thing you teach but prove a chief offender in the same o loving uncle kind duke of gloucester  how joyful am i made by this contract away my masters trouble us no more but join in friendship as your lords have done and those occasions uncle were of force  therefore my loving lords our pleasure is that richard be restorèd to his blood if richard will be true not that alone but all the whole inheritance i give that doth belong unto the house of york from whence you spring by lineal descent stoop then and set your knee against my foot and in reguerdon of that duty done i girt thee with the valiant sword of york rise richard like a true plantagenet and rise created princely duke of york when gloucester says the word king henry goes for friendly counsel cuts off many foes is this the lord talbot uncle gloucester that hath so long been resident in france welcome brave captain and victorious lord when i was young as yet i am not old  i do remember how my father said a stouter champion never handled sword long since we were resolvèd of your truth your faithful service and your toil in war yet never have you tasted our reward or been reguerdoned with so much as thanks because till now we never saw your face therefore stand up and for these good deserts we here create you earl of shrewsbury and in our coronation take your place stain to thy countrymen thou hear'st thy doom be packing therefore thou that wast a knight henceforth we banish thee on pain of death and now my lord protector view the letter sent from our uncle duke of burgundy what doth my uncle burgundy revolt is that the worst this letter doth contain why then lord talbot there shall talk with him and give him chastisement for this abuse  how say you my lord are you not content then gather strength and march unto him straight let him perceive how ill we brook his treason and what offense it is to flout his friends be patient lords and give them leave to speak  say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim and wherefore crave you combat or with whom what is that wrong whereof you both complain first let me know and then i'll answer you good lord what madness rules in brainsick men when for so slight and frivolous a cause such factious emulations shall arise good cousins both of york and somerset quiet yourselves i pray and be at peace come hither you that would be combatants henceforth i charge you as you love our favor quite to forget this quarrel and the cause  and you my lords remember where we are in france amongst a fickle wavering nation if they perceive dissension in our looks and that within ourselves we disagree how will their grudging stomachs be provoked to willful disobedience and rebel besides what infamy will there arise when foreign princes shall be certified that for a toy a thing of no regard king henry's peers and chief nobility destroyed themselves and lost the realm of france o think upon the conquest of my father my tender years and let us not forgo that for a trifle that was bought with blood let me be umpire in this doubtful strife i see no reason if i wear this rose that anyone should therefore be suspicious i more incline to somerset than york both are my kinsmen and i love them both as well they may upbraid me with my crown because forsooth the king of scots is crowned but your discretions better can persuade than i am able to instruct or teach and therefore as we hither came in peace so let us still continue peace and love cousin of york we institute your grace to be our regent in these parts of france  and good my lord of somerset unite your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot and like true subjects sons of your progenitors go cheerfully together and digest your angry choler on your enemies ourself my lord protector and the rest after some respite will return to callice from thence to england where i hope ere long to be presented by your victories with charles alanson and that traitorous rout have you perused the letters from the pope the emperor and the earl of armagnac how doth your grace affect their motion ay marry uncle for i always thought it was both impious and unnatural that such immanity and bloody strife should reign among professors of one faith marriage uncle alas my years are young and fitter is my study and my books than wanton dalliance with a paramour yet call th' ambassadors and as you please so let them have their answers every one i shall be well content with any choice tends to god's glory and my country's weal my lords ambassadors your several suits have been considered and debated on your purpose is both good and reasonable and therefore are we certainly resolved to draw conditions of a friendly peace which by my lord of winchester we mean shall be transported presently to france in argument and proof of which contract bear her this jewel pledge of my affection  and so my lord protector see them guarded and safely brought to dover where inshipped commit them to the fortune of the sea your wondrous rare description noble earl of beauteous margaret hath astonished me her virtues gracèd with external gifts do breed love's settled passions in my heart and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwrack or arrive where i may have fruition of her love and otherwise will henry ne'er presume  therefore my lord protector give consent that margaret may be england's royal queen whether it be through force of your report my noble lord of suffolk or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love i cannot tell but this i am assured i feel such sharp dissension in my breast such fierce alarums both of hope and fear as i am sick with working of my thoughts take therefore shipping post my lord to france agree to any covenants and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crowned king henry's faithful and anointed queen for your expenses and sufficient charge among the people gather up a tenth be gone i say for till you do return i rest perplexèd with a thousand cares  and you good uncle banish all offense if you do censure me by what you were not what you are i know it will excuse this sudden execution of my will and so conduct me where from company i may revolve and ruminate my grief
