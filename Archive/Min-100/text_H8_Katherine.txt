nay we must longer kneel i am a suitor thank your majesty that you would love yourself and in that love not unconsidered leave your honor nor the dignity of your office is the point of my petition i am solicited not by a few and those of true condition that your subjects are in great grievance there have been commissions sent down among 'em which hath flawed the heart of all their loyalties wherein although my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches most bitterly on you as putter on of these exactions yet the king our master whose honor heaven shield from soil even he escapes not language unmannerly yea such which breaks the sides of loyalty and almost appears in loud rebellion no my lord you know no more than others but you frame things that are known alike which are not wholesome to those which would not know them and yet must perforce be their acquaintance these exactions whereof my sovereign would have note they are most pestilent to th' hearing and to bear 'em the back is sacrifice to th' load they say they are devised by you or else you suffer too hard an exclamation i am much too venturous in tempting of your patience but am boldened under your promised pardon the subjects' grief comes through commissions which compels from each the sixth part of his substance to be levied without delay and the pretense for this is named your wars in france this makes bold mouths tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze allegiance in them their curses now live where their prayers did and it's come to pass this tractable obedience is a slave to each incensèd will i would your highness would give it quick consideration for there is no primer baseness i am sorry that the duke of buckingham is run in your displeasure my learnèd lord cardinal deliver all with charity if i know you well you were the duke's surveyor and lost your office on the complaint o' th' tenants take good heed you charge not in your spleen a noble person and spoil your nobler soul i say take heed  yes heartily beseech you god mend all sir i desire you do me right and justice and to bestow your pity on me for i am a most poor woman and a stranger born out of your dominions having here no judge indifferent nor no more assurance of equal friendship and proceeding alas sir in what have i offended you what cause hath my behavior given to your displeasure that thus you should proceed to put me off and take your good grace from me heaven witness i have been to you a true and humble wife at all times to your will conformable ever in fear to kindle your dislike yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry as i saw it inclined when was the hour i ever contradicted your desire or made it not mine too or which of your friends have i not strove to love although i knew he were mine enemy what friend of mine that had to him derived your anger did i continue in my liking nay gave notice he was from thence discharged sir call to mind that i have been your wife in this obedience upward of twenty years and have been blessed with many children by you if in the course and process of this time you can report and prove it too against mine honor aught my bond to wedlock or my love and duty against your sacred person in god's name turn me away and let the foul'st contempt shut door upon me and so give me up to the sharp'st kind of justice please you sir the king your father was reputed for a prince most prudent of an excellent and unmatched wit and judgment ferdinand my father king of spain was reckoned one the wisest prince that there had reigned by many a year before it is not to be questioned that they had gathered a wise council to them of every realm that did debate this business who deemed our marriage lawful wherefore i humbly beseech you sir to spare me till i may be by my friends in spain advised whose counsel i will implore if not i' th' name of god your pleasure be fulfilled lord cardinal to you i speak sir i am about to weep but thinking that we are a queen or long have dreamed so certain the daughter of a king my drops of tears i'll turn to sparks of fire i will when you are humble nay before or god will punish me i do believe induced by potent circumstances that you are mine enemy and make my challenge you shall not be my judge for it is you have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me  which god's dew quench therefore i say again i utterly abhor yea from my soul refuse you for my judge whom yet once more i hold my most malicious foe and think not at all a friend to truth my lord my lord i am a simple woman much too weak t' oppose your cunning you're meek and humble mouthed you sign your place and calling in full seeming with meekness and humility but your heart is crammed with arrogancy spleen and pride you have by fortune and his highness' favors gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted where powers are your retainers and your words domestics to you serve your will as 't please yourself pronounce their office i must tell you you tender more your person's honor than your high profession spiritual that again i do refuse you for my judge and here before you all appeal unto the pope to bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness and to be judged by him what need you note it pray you keep your way when you are called return now the lord help they vex me past my patience pray you pass on i will not tarry no nor ever more upon this business my appearance make in any of their courts take thy lute wench my soul grows sad with troubles sing and disperse 'em if thou canst leave working how now would they speak with me pray their graces to come near what can be their business with me a poor weak woman fall'n from favor i do not like their coming now i think on 't they should be good men their affairs as righteous but all hoods make not monks your graces find me here part of a housewife i would be all against the worst may happen what are your pleasures with me reverend lords speak it here there's nothing i have done yet o' my conscience deserves a corner would all other women could speak this with as free a soul as i do my lords i care not so much i am happy above a number if my actions were tried by ev'ry tongue ev'ry eye saw 'em envy and base opinion set against 'em i know my life so even if your business seek me out and that way i am wife in out with it boldly truth loves open dealing o good my lord no latin i am not such a truant since my coming as not to know the language i have lived in a strange tongue makes my cause more strange suspicious pray speak in english here are some will thank you if you speak truth for their poor mistress' sake believe me she has had much wrong lord cardinal the willing'st sin i ever yet committed may be absolved in english to betray me  my lords i thank you both for your good wills you speak like honest men pray god you prove so but how to make you suddenly an answer in such a point of weight so near mine honor  more near my life i fear with my weak wit and to such men of gravity and learning in truth i know not i was set at work among my maids full little god knows looking either for such men or such business for her sake that i have been for i feel the last fit of my greatness good your graces let me have time and counsel for my cause alas i am a woman friendless hopeless in england but little for my profit can you think lords that any englishman dare give me counsel or be a known friend 'gainst his highness' pleasure though he be grown so desperate to be honest and live a subject nay forsooth my friends they that must weigh out my afflictions they that my trust must grow to live not here they are as all my other comforts far hence in mine own country lords how sir you tell me what you wish for both my ruin is this your christian counsel out upon you heaven is above all yet there sits a judge that no king can corrupt the more shame for you holy men i thought you upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues but cardinal sins and hollow hearts i fear you mend 'em for shame my lords is this your comfort the cordial that you bring a wretched lady a woman lost among you laughed at scorned i will not wish you half my miseries i have more charity but say i warned you take heed for heaven's sake take heed lest at once the burden of my sorrows fall upon you you turn me into nothing woe upon you and all such false professors would you have me  if you have any justice any pity if you be anything but churchmen's habits  put my sick cause into his hands that hates me alas has banished me his bed already his love too long ago i am old my lords and all the fellowship i hold now with him is only my obedience what can happen to me above this wretchedness all your studies make me a curse like this have i lived thus long let me speak myself since virtue finds no friends a wife a true one  a woman i dare say without vainglory never yet branded with suspicion  have i with all my full affections still met the king loved him next heav'n obeyed him been out of fondness superstitious to him almost forgot my prayers to content him and am i thus rewarded 'tis not well lords bring me a constant woman to her husband one that ne'er dreamed a joy beyond his pleasure and to that woman when she has done most yet will i add an honor a great patience my lord i dare not make myself so guilty to give up willingly that noble title your master wed me to nothing but death shall e'er divorce my dignities would i had never trod this english earth or felt the flatteries that grow upon it you have angels' faces but heaven knows your hearts what will become of me now wretched lady i am the most unhappy woman living alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes shipwracked upon a kingdom where no pity no friends no hope no kindred weep for me almost no grave allowed me like the lily that once was mistress of the field and flourished i'll hang my head and perish do what you will my lords and pray forgive me if i have used myself unmannerly you know i am a woman lacking wit to make a seemly answer to such persons pray do my service to his majesty he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers while i shall have my life come reverend fathers bestow your counsels on me she now begs that little thought when she set footing here she should have bought her dignities so dear o griffith sick to death my legs like loaden branches bow to th' earth willing to leave their burden reach a chair so now methinks i feel a little ease didst thou not tell me griffith as thou ledst me that the great child of honor cardinal wolsey was dead prithee good griffith tell me how he died if well he stepped before me happily for my example alas poor man so may he rest his faults lie gently on him yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him and yet with charity he was a man of an unbounded stomach ever ranking himself with princes one that by suggestion tied all the kingdom simony was fair play his own opinion was his law i' th' presence he would say untruths and be ever double both in his words and meaning he was never but where he meant to ruin pitiful his promises were as he then was mighty but his performance as he is now nothing of his own body he was ill and gave the clergy ill example yes good griffith i were malicious else after my death i wish no other herald no other speaker of my living actions to keep mine honor from corruption but such an honest chronicler as griffith whom i most hated living thou hast made me with thy religious truth and modesty now in his ashes honor peace be with him  patience be near me still and set me lower i have not long to trouble thee good griffith cause the musicians play me that sad note i named my knell whilst i sit meditating on that celestial harmony i go to spirits of peace where are you are you all gone and leave me here in wretchedness behind you it is not you i call for saw you none enter since i slept no saw you not even now a blessed troop invite me to a banquet whose bright faces cast thousand beams upon me like the sun they promised me eternal happiness and brought me garlands griffith which i feel i am not worthy yet to wear i shall assuredly bid the music leave they are harsh and heavy to me you are a saucy fellow deserve we no more reverence admit him entrance griffith but this fellow let me ne'er see again if my sight fail not you should be lord ambassador from the emperor my royal nephew and your name capuchius o my lord the times and titles now are altered strangely with me since first you knew me but i pray you what is your pleasure with me o my good lord that comfort comes too late 'tis like a pardon after execution that gentle physic given in time had cured me but now i am past all comforts here but prayers how does his highness so may he ever do and ever flourish when i shall dwell with worms and my poor name banished the kingdom patience is that letter i caused you write yet sent away sir i most humbly pray you to deliver this to my lord the king  in which i have commended to his goodness the model of our chaste loves his young daughter  the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her  beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding  she is young and of a noble modest nature i hope she will deserve well and a little to love her for her mother's sake that loved him heaven knows how dearly my next poor petition is that his noble grace would have some pity upon my wretched women that so long have followed both my fortunes faithfully of which there is not one i dare avow  and now i should not lie but will deserve for virtue and true beauty of the soul for honesty and decent carriage a right good husband let him be a noble and sure those men are happy that shall have 'em the last is for my men they are the poorest but poverty could never draw 'em from me  that they may have their wages duly paid 'em and something over to remember me by if heaven had pleased to have given me longer life and able means we had not parted thus these are the whole contents and good my lord by that you love the dearest in this world as you wish christian peace to souls departed stand these poor people's friend and urge the king to do me this last right i thank you honest lord remember me in all humility unto his highness say his long trouble now is passing out of this world tell him in death i blessed him for so i will mine eyes grow dim farewell my lord griffith farewell nay patience you must not leave me yet i must to bed call in more women when i am dead good wench let me be used with honor strew me over with maiden flowers that all the world may know i was a chaste wife to my grave embalm me then lay me forth although unqueened yet like a queen and daughter to a king inter me i can no more
