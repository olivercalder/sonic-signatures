first my fear then my curtsy last my speech my fear is your displeasure my curtsy my duty and my speech to beg your pardons if you look for a good speech now you undo me for what i have to say is of mine own making and what indeed i should say will i doubt prove mine own marring but to the purpose and so to the venture be it known to you as it is very well i was lately here in the end of a displeasing play to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better i meant indeed to pay you with this which if like an ill venture it come unluckily home i break and you my gentle creditors lose here i promised you i would be and here i commit my body to your mercies bate me some and i will pay you some and as most debtors do promise you infinitely and so i kneel down before you but indeed to pray for the queen if my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will you command me to use my legs and yet that were but light payment to dance out of your debt but a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction and so would i all the gentlewomen here have forgiven me if the gentlemen will not then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen which was never seen before in such an assembly one word more i beseech you if you be not too much cloyed with fat meat our humble author will continue the story with sir john in it and make you merry with fair katherine of france where for anything i know falstaff shall die of a sweat unless already he be killed with your hard opinions for oldcastle died a martyr and this is not the man my tongue is weary when my legs are too i will bid you good night
