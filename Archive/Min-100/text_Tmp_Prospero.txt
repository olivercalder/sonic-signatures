be collected no more amazement tell your piteous heart there's no harm done no harm i have done nothing but in care of thee of thee my dear one thee my daughter who art ignorant of what thou art naught knowing of whence i am nor that i am more better than prospero master of a full poor cell and thy no greater father 'tis time i should inform thee farther lend thy hand and pluck my magic garment from me so lie there my art wipe thou thine eyes have comfort the direful spectacle of the wrack which touched the very virtue of compassion in thee i have with such provision in mine art so safely ordered that there is no soul  no not so much perdition as an hair betid to any creature in the vessel which thou heard'st cry which thou saw'st sink sit down for thou must now know farther the hour's now come the very minute bids thee ope thine ear obey and be attentive canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell i do not think thou canst for then thou wast not out three years old by what by any other house or person of anything the image tell me that hath kept with thy remembrance thou hadst and more miranda but how is it that this lives in thy mind what seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time if thou rememb'rest aught ere thou cam'st here how thou cam'st here thou mayst twelve year since miranda twelve year since thy father was the duke of milan and a prince of power thy mother was a piece of virtue and she said thou wast my daughter and thy father was duke of milan and his only heir and princess no worse issued both both my girl by foul play as thou sayst were we heaved thence but blessedly holp hither my brother and thy uncle called antonio  i pray thee mark me that a brother should be so perfidious he whom next thyself of all the world i loved and to him put the manage of my state as at that time through all the signories it was the first and prospero the prime duke being so reputed in dignity and for the liberal arts without a parallel those being all my study the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger being transported and rapt in secret studies thy false uncle  dost thou attend me being once perfected how to grant suits how to deny them who t' advance and who to trash for overtopping new created the creatures that were mine i say or changed 'em or else new formed 'em having both the key of officer and office set all hearts i' th' state to what tune pleased his ear that now he was the ivy which had hid my princely trunk and sucked my verdure out on 't thou attend'st not i pray thee mark me i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which but by being so retired o'erprized all popular rate in my false brother awaked an evil nature and my trust like a good parent did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was which had indeed no limit a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded not only with what my revenue yielded but what my power might else exact like one who having into truth by telling of it made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie he did believe he was indeed the duke out o' th' substitution and executing th' outward face of royalty with all prerogative hence his ambition growing  dost thou hear to have no screen between this part he played and him he played it for he needs will be absolute milan me poor man my library was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable confederates so dry he was for sway wi' th' king of naples to give him annual tribute do him homage subject his coronet to his crown and bend the dukedom yet unbowed alas poor milan  to most ignoble stooping mark his condition and th' event then tell me if this might be a brother now the condition this king of naples being an enemy to me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit which was that he in lieu o' th' premises of homage and i know not how much tribute should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair milan with all the honors on my brother whereon a treacherous army levied one midnight fated to th' purpose did antonio open the gates of milan and i' th' dead of darkness the ministers for th' purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self hear a little further and then i'll bring thee to the present business which now 's upon 's without the which this story were most impertinent well demanded wench my tale provokes that question dear they durst not so dear the love my people bore me nor set a mark so bloody on the business but with colors fairer painted their foul ends in few they hurried us aboard a bark bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared a rotten carcass of a butt not rigged nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats instinctively have quit it there they hoist us to cry to th' sea that roared to us to sigh to th' winds whose pity sighing back again did us but loving wrong o a cherubin thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile infus√®d with a fortitude from heaven when i have decked the sea with drops full salt under my burden groaned which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue by providence divine some food we had and some fresh water that a noble neapolitan gonzalo out of his charity who being then appointed master of this design did give us with rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries which since have steaded much so of his gentleness knowing i loved my books he furnished me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my dukedom now

did confine thee by help of her more potent ministers and in her most unmitigable rage into a cloven pine within which rift imprisoned thou didst painfully remain a dozen years within which space she died and left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans as fast as mill wheels strike then was this island save for the son that she did litter here a freckled whelp hag born not honored with a human shape dull thing i say so he that caliban whom now i keep in service thou best know'st what torment i did find thee in thy groans did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts of ever angry

well for some of you there present are worse than devils praise in departing bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou performed my ariel a grace it had devouring of my instruction hast thou nothing bated in what thou hadst to say so with good life and observation strange my meaner ministers their several kinds have done my high charms work and these mine enemies are all knit up in their distractions they now are in my power and in these fits i leave them while i visit young ferdinand whom they suppose is drowned and his and mine loved darling if i have too austerely punished you your compensation makes amends for i have given you here a third of mine own life or that for which i live who once again i tender to thy hand all thy vexations were but my trials of thy love and thou hast strangely stood the test here afore heaven i ratify this my rich gift o ferdinand do not smile at me that i boast of her for thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise and make it halt behind her then as my gift and thine own acquisition worthily purchased take my daughter but if thou dost break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite be ministered no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall to make this contract grow but barren hate sour eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew the union of your bed with weeds so loathly that you shall hate it both therefore take heed as hymen's lamps shall light you fairly spoke sit then and talk with her she is thine own what ariel my industrious servant ariel thou and thy meaner fellows your last service did worthily perform and i must use you in such another trick go bring the rabble o'er whom i give thee power here to this place incite them to quick motion for i must bestow upon the eyes of this young couple some vanity of mine art it is my promise and they expect it from me ay with a twink dearly my delicate ariel do not approach till thou dost hear me call look thou be true do not give

appear and pertly no tongue all eyes be silent spirits which by mine art i have from their confines called to enact my present fancies sweet now silence juno and ceres whisper seriously there's something else to do hush and be mute or else our spell is marred i had forgot that foul conspiracy of the beast caliban and his confederates against my life the minute of their plot is almost come well done avoid no more you do look my son in a moved sort as if you were dismayed be cheerful sir our revels now are ended these our actors as i foretold you were all spirits and are melted into air into thin air and like the baseless fabric of this vision the cloud capped towers the gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself yea all which it inherit shall dissolve and like this insubstantial pageant faded leave not a rack behind we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep sir i am vexed bear with my weakness my old brain is troubled be not disturbed with my infirmity if you be pleased retire into my cell and there repose a turn or two i'll walk to still my beating mind come with a thought i thank thee ariel come spirit we must prepare to meet with caliban say again where didst thou leave these varlets this was well done my bird thy shape invisible retain thou still the trumpery in my house go bring it hither for stale to catch these thieves a devil a born devil on whose nature nurture can never stick on whom my pains humanely taken all all lost quite lost and as with age his body uglier grows so his mind cankers i will plague them all even to roaring come hang them on this line hey mountain hey fury fury there tyrant there hark hark go charge my goblins that they grind their joints with dry convulsions shorten up their sinews with ag√®d cramps and more pinch spotted make them than pard or cat o' mountain let them be hunted soundly at this hour lies at my mercy all mine enemies shortly shall all my labors end and thou shalt have the air at freedom for a little follow and do me service now does my project gather to a head my charms crack not my spirits obey and time goes upright with his carriage how's the day i did say so when first i raised the tempest say my spirit how fares the king and 's followers dost thou think so spirit and mine shall hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling of their afflictions and shall not myself one of their kind that relish all as sharply passion as they be kindlier moved than thou art though with their high wrongs i am struck to th' quick yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury do i take part the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent the sole drift of my purpose doth extend not a frown further go release them ariel my charms i'll break their senses i'll restore and they shall be themselves you elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves and you that on the sands with printless foot do chase the ebbing neptune and do fly him when he comes back you demi puppets that by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime is to make midnight mushrumps that rejoice to hear the solemn curfew by whose aid weak masters though you be i have bedimmed the noontide sun called forth the mutinous winds and 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder have i given fire and rifted jove's stout oak with his own bolt the strong based promontory have i made shake and by the spurs plucked up the pine and cedar graves at my command have waked their sleepers oped and let 'em forth by my so potent art but this rough magic i here abjure and when i have required some heavenly music which even now i do to work mine end upon their senses that this airy charm is for i'll break my staff bury it certain fathoms in the earth and deeper than did ever plummet sound i'll drown my book a solemn air and the best comforter to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains now useless boiled within thy skull there stand for you are spell stopped  holy gonzalo honorable man mine eyes e'en sociable to the show of thine fall fellowly drops the charm dissolves apace and as the morning steals upon the night melting the darkness so their rising senses begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle their clearer reason o good gonzalo my true preserver and a loyal sir to him thou follow'st i will pay thy graces home both in word and deed most cruelly didst thou alonso use me and my daughter thy brother was a furtherer in the act  thou art pinched for 't now sebastian flesh and blood you brother mine that entertained ambition expelled remorse and nature whom with sebastian whose inward pinches therefore are most strong would here have killed your king i do forgive thee unnatural though thou art their understanding begins to swell and the approaching tide will shortly fill the reasonable shore that now lies foul and muddy not one of them that yet looks on me or would know me ariel fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell i will discase me and myself present as i was sometime milan quickly spirit thou shalt ere long be free why that's my dainty ariel i shall miss thee but yet thou shalt have freedom so so so to the king's ship invisible as thou art there shalt thou find the mariners asleep under the hatches the master and the boatswain being awake enforce them to this place and presently i prithee behold sir king the wrong√®d duke of milan prospero for more assurance that a living prince does now speak to thee i embrace thy body and to thee and thy company i bid a hearty welcome first noble friend let me embrace thine age whose honor cannot be measured or confined you do yet taste some subtleties o' th' isle that will not let you believe things certain welcome my friends all but you my brace of lords were i so minded i here could pluck his highness' frown upon you and justify you traitors at this time i will tell no tales no for you most wicked sir whom to call brother would even infect my mouth i do forgive thy rankest fault all of them and require my dukedom of thee which perforce i know thou must restore i am woe for 't sir i rather think you have not sought her help of whose soft grace for the like loss i have her sovereign aid and rest myself content as great to me as late and supportable to make the dear loss have i means much weaker than you may call to comfort you for i have lost my daughter in this last tempest i perceive these lords at this encounter do so much admire that they devour their reason and scarce think their eyes do offices of truth their words are natural breath but howsoe'er you have been justled from your senses know for certain that i am prospero and that very duke which was thrust forth of milan who most strangely upon this shore where you were wracked was landed to be the lord on 't no more yet of this for 'tis a chronicle of day by day not a relation for a breakfast nor befitting this first meeting welcome sir this cell's my court here have i few attendants and subjects none abroad pray you look in my dukedom since you have given me again i will requite you with as good a thing at least bring forth a wonder to content you as much as me my dukedom 'tis new to thee there sir stop let us not burden our remembrances with a heaviness that's gone my tricksy spirit bravely my diligence thou shalt be free sir my liege do not infest your mind with beating on the strangeness of this business at picked leisure which shall be shortly single i'll resolve you which to you shall seem probable of every these happened accidents till when be cheerful and think of each thing well come hither spirit set caliban and his companions free untie the spell how fares my gracious sir there are yet missing of your company some few odd lads that you remember not mark but the badges of these men my lords then say if they be true this misshapen knave his mother was a witch and one so strong that could control the moon make flows and ebbs and deal in her command without her power these three have robbed me and this demi devil for he's a bastard one had plotted with them to take my life two of these fellows you must know and own this thing of darkness i acknowledge mine you'd be king o' the isle sirrah he is as disproportioned in his manners as in his shape go sirrah to my cell take with you your companions as you look to have my pardon trim it handsomely go to away sir i invite your highness and your train to my poor cell where you shall take your rest for this one night which part of it i'll waste with such discourse as i not doubt shall make it go quick away the story of my life and the particular accidents gone by since i came to this isle and in the morn i'll bring you to your ship and so to naples where i have hope to see the nuptial of these our dear belov√®d solemnized and thence retire me to my milan where every third thought shall be my grave i'll deliver all and promise you calm seas auspicious gales and sail so expeditious that shall catch your royal fleet far off my ariel chick that is thy charge then to the elements be free and fare thou well please you draw near now my charms are all o'erthrown and what strength i have 's mine own which is most faint now 'tis true i must be here confined by you or sent to naples let me not since i have my dukedom got and pardoned the deceiver dwell in this bare island by your spell but release me from my bands with the help of your good hands gentle breath of yours my sails must fill or else my project fails which was to please now i want spirits to enforce art to enchant and my ending is despair unless i be relieved by prayer which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all faults as you from crimes would pardoned be let your indulgence set me free
