speak thou for me and tell them what i did thus do i hope to shake king henry's head armed as we are let's stay within this house you are old enough now and yet methinks you lose  father tear the crown from the usurper's head sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly brother though i be youngest give me leave about that which concerns your grace and us the crown of england father which is yours your right depends not on his life or death no god forbid your grace should be forsworn i'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak an oath is of no moment being not took before a true and lawful magistrate that hath authority over him that swears henry had none but did usurp the place then seeing 'twas he that made you to depose your oath my lord is vain and frivolous therefore to arms and father do but think how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown within whose circuit is elysium and all that poets feign of bliss and joy why do we linger thus i cannot rest until the white rose that i wear be dyed even in the lukewarm blood of henry's heart ay with five hundred father for a need a woman's general what should we fear i cannot joy until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become i saw him in the battle range about and watched him how he singled clifford forth methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompassed round with dogs who having pinched a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him so fared our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles it the prime of youth trimmed like a younker prancing to his love three glorious suns each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds but severed in a pale clear shining sky see see they join embrace and seem to kiss as if they vowed some league inviolable now are they but one lamp one light one sun in this the heaven figures some event nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it you love the breeder better than the male but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue say how he died for i will hear it all i cannot weep for all my body's moisture scarce serves to quench my furnace burning heart nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden for selfsame wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast and burns me up with flames that tears would quench to weep is to make less the depth of grief tears then for babes blows and revenge for me richard i bear thy name i'll venge thy death or die renownèd by attempting it nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say either that is thine or else thou wert not his great lord of warwick if we should recount our baleful news and at each word's deliverance stab poniards in our flesh till all were told the words would add more anguish than the wounds o valiant lord the duke of york is slain 'twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled oft have i heard his praises in pursuit but ne'er till now his scandal of retire i know it well lord warwick blame me not 'tis love i bear thy glories make me speak but in this troublous time what's to be done shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns numb'ring our ave marys with our beads or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms if for the last say ay and to it lords ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day that cries retire if warwick bid him stay then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds i come to pierce it or to give thee mine are you there butcher o i cannot speak 'twas you that killed young rutland was it not for god's sake lords give signal to the fight northumberland i hold thee reverently  break off the parley for scarce i can refrain the execution of my big swoll'n heart upon that clifford that cruel child killer ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland but ere sunset i'll make thee curse the deed then executioner unsheathe thy sword by him that made us all i am resolved that clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue whoever got thee there thy mother stands for well i wot thou hast thy mother's tongue iron of naples hid with english gilt whose father bears the title of a king as if a channel should be called the sea sham'st thou not knowing whence thou art extraught to let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk broached with the steely point of clifford's lance and in the very pangs of death he cried like to a dismal clangor heard from far warwick revenge brother revenge my death so underneath the belly of their steeds that stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood the noble gentleman gave up the ghost brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick let me embrace thee in my weary arms i that did never weep now melt with woe that winter should cut off our springtime so now clifford i have singled thee alone suppose this arm is for the duke of york and this for rutland both bound to revenge wert thou environed with a brazen wall nay warwick single out some other chase for i myself will hunt this wolf to death whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave a deadly groan like life and death's departing revoke that doom of mercy for 'tis clifford who not contented that he lopped the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth but set his murd'ring knife unto the root from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring i mean our princely father duke of york o would he did and so perhaps he doth 'tis but his policy to counterfeit because he would avoid such bitter taunts which in the time of death he gave our father clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace thou didst love york and i am son to york what not an oath nay then the world goes hard when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath i know by that he's dead and by my soul if this right hand would buy but two hours' life that i in all despite might rail at him this hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstaunchèd thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester for gloucester's dukedom is too ominous your highness shall do well to grant her suit it were dishonor to deny it her yea is it so i see the lady hath a thing to grant before the king will grant her humble suit silence ay widow then i'll warrant you all your lands an if what pleases him shall pleasure you fight closer or good faith you'll catch a blow god forbid that for he'll take vantages nay then whip me he'll rather give her two you shall have four if you'll be ruled by him ay good leave have you for you will have leave till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch he plies her hard and much rain wears the marble the match is made she seals it with a cursy the widow likes him not she knits her brows the ghostly father now hath done his shrift the widow likes it not for she looks very sad that would be ten days' wonder at the least by so much is the wonder in extremes ay edward will use women honorably would he were wasted marrow bones and all  that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for and yet between my soul's desire and me the lustful edward's title burièd is clarence henry and his son young edward and all the unlooked for issue of their bodies to take their rooms ere i can place myself a cold premeditation for my purpose why then i do but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a far off shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying he'll lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say i'll cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities my eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford i'll make my heaven in a lady's lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and 'witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns why love forswore me in my mother's womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a withered shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlicked bear whelp that carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be beloved o monstrous fault to harbor such a thought then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to check to o'erbear such as are of better person than myself i'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live t' account this world but hell until my misshaped trunk that bears this head be round impalèd with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and i like one lost in a thorny wood that rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murder whiles i smile and cry content to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions i'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall i'll slay more gazers than the basilisk i'll play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slyly than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colors to the chameleon change shapes with proteus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this and cannot get a crown tut were it farther off i'll pluck it down now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice and his well chosen bride and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well not i no god forbid that i should wish them severed whom god hath joined together ay and 'twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonorèd by this new marriage and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood i hear yet say not much but think the more not i my thoughts aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown ay in despite of all that shall withstand you now my lord hastings and sir william stanley leave off to wonder why i drew you hither into this chiefest thicket of the park thus stands the case you know our king my brother is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands he hath good usage and great liberty and often but attended with weak guard comes hunting this way to disport himself i have advertised him by secret means that if about this hour he make this way under the color of his usual game he shall here find his friends with horse and men to set him free from his captivity brother the time and case requireth haste your horse stands ready at the park corner well guessed believe me for that was my meaning but wherefore stay we 'tis no time to talk come then away let's ha' no more ado the gates made fast brother i like not this for many men that stumble at the threshold are well foretold that danger lurks within but when the fox hath once got in his nose he'll soon find means to make the body follow a wise stout captain and soon persuaded brother this is sir john montgomery our trusty friend unless i be deceived why brother wherefore stand you on nice points and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns brother we will proclaim you out of hand the bruit thereof will bring you many friends long live edward the fourth away betimes before his forces join and take the great grown traitor unawares brave warriors march amain towards coventry see how the surly warwick mans the wall i thought at least he would have said the king or did he make the jest against his will ay by my faith for a poor earl to give i'll do thee service for so good a gift alas that warwick had no more forecast but whiles he thought to steal the single ten the king was slyly fingered from the deck you left poor henry at the bishop's palace and ten to one you'll meet him in the tower come warwick take the time kneel down kneel down nay when strike now or else the iron cools the gates are open let us enter too thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason even with the dearest blood your bodies bear two of thy name both dukes of somerset have sold their lives unto the house of york and thou shalt be the third if this sword hold welcome good clarence this is brother like the queen is valued thirty thousand strong and somerset with oxford fled to her if she have time to breathe be well assured her faction will be full as strong as ours it is and lo where youthful edward comes that you might still have worn the petticoat and ne'er have stol'n the breech from lancaster by heaven brat i'll plague you for that word for god's sake take away this captive scold sprawl'st thou take that to end thy agony marry and shall why should she live to fill the world with words clarence excuse me to the king my brother i'll hence to london on a serious matter ere you come there be sure to hear some news the tower the tower good day my lord what at your book so hard sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer suspicion always haunts the guilty mind the thief doth fear each bush an officer why what a peevish fool was that of crete that taught his son the office of a fowl and yet for all his wings the fool was drowned think'st thou i am an executioner thy son i killed for his presumption i'll hear no more die prophet in thy speech for this amongst the rest was i ordained what will the aspiring blood of lancaster sink in the ground i thought it would have mounted see how my sword weeps for the poor king's death o may such purple tears be always shed from those that wish the downfall of our house if any spark of life be yet remaining down down to hell and say i sent thee thither  i that have neither pity love nor fear indeed 'tis true that henry told me of for i have often heard my mother say i came into the world with my legs forward had i not reason think you to make haste and seek their ruin that usurped our right the midwife wondered and the women cried o jesus bless us he is born with teeth and so i was which plainly signified that i should snarl and bite and play the dog then since the heavens have shaped my body so let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it i have no brother i am like no brother and this word love which graybeards call divine be resident in men like one another and not in me i am myself alone clarence beware thou keep'st me from the light but i will sort a pitchy day for thee for i will buzz abroad such prophecies that edward shall be fearful of his life and then to purge his fear i'll be thy death king henry and the prince his son are gone clarence thy turn is next and then the rest counting myself but bad till i be best i'll throw thy body in another room and triumph henry in thy day of doom i'll blast his harvest if your head were laid for yet i am not looked on in the world this shoulder was ordained so thick to heave and heave it shall some weight or break my back work thou the way and that shalt execute and that i love the tree from whence thou sprang'st witness the loving kiss i give the fruit to say the truth so judas kissed his master and cried all hail whenas he meant all harm
