you look not well signior antonio you have too much respect upon the world they lose it that do buy it with much care believe me you are marvelously changed let me play the fool with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come and let my liver rather heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans why should a man whose blood is warm within sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice by being peevish i tell thee what antonio i love thee and 'tis my love that speaks there are a sort of men whose visages do cream and mantle like a standing pond and do a willful stillness entertain with purpose to be dressed in an opinion of wisdom gravity profound conceit as who should say i am sir oracle and when i ope my lips let no dog bark o my antonio i do know of these that therefore only are reputed wise for saying nothing when i am very sure if they should speak would almost damn those ears which hearing them would call their brothers fools i'll tell thee more of this another time but fish not with this melancholy bait for this fool gudgeon this opinion  come good lorenzo fare you well a while i'll end my exhortation after dinner well keep me company but two years more thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue thanks i' faith for silence is only commendable in a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible

sad ostent to please his grandam never trust me more nay but i bar tonight you shall not gauge me by what we do tonight and i must to lorenzo and the rest but we will visit you at supper time we have not made good preparation love news in faith was not that letter from fair jessica this is the penthouse under which lorenzo desired us to make stand and it is marvel he outdwells his hour for lovers ever run before the clock that ever holds who riseth from a feast with that keen appetite that he sits down where is the horse that doth untread again his tedious measures with the unbated fire that he did pace them first all things that are are with more spirit chasèd than enjoyed how like a younger or a prodigal the scarfèd bark puts from her native bay hugged and embracèd by the strumpet wind how like the prodigal doth she return with overweathered ribs and raggèd sails lean rent and beggared by the strumpet wind now by my hood a gentle and no jew signior antonio i am glad on 't i desire no more delight than to be under sail and gone tonight my lord bassanio and my gentle lady i wish you all the joy that you can wish for i am sure you can wish none from me and when your honors mean to solemnize the bargain of your faith i do beseech you even at that time i may be married too i thank your lordship you have got me one my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours you saw the mistress i beheld the maid you loved i loved for intermission no more pertains to me my lord than you your fortune stood upon the caskets there and so did mine too as the matter falls for wooing here until i sweat again and swearing till my very roof was dry with oaths of love at last if promise last i got a promise of this fair one here to have her love provided that your fortune achieved her mistress yes faith my lord we'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats no we shall ne'er win at that sport and stake down but who comes here lorenzo and his infidel what and my old venetian friend salerio nerissa cheer yond stranger bid her welcome  your hand salerio what's the news from venice how doth that royal merchant good antonio i know he will be glad of our success we are the jasons we have won the fleece not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh jew thou mak'st thy knife keen but no metal can no not the hangman's axe bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy can no prayers pierce thee o be thou damned inexecrable dog and for thy life let justice be accused thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith to hold opinion with pythagoras that souls of animals infuse themselves into the trunks of men thy currish spirit governed a wolf who hanged for human slaughter even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet and whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam infused itself in thee for thy desires are wolfish bloody starved and ravenous i have a wife who i protest i love i would she were in heaven so she could entreat some power to change this currish jew o upright judge mark jew o learnèd judge o learnèd judge mark jew a learnèd judge o jew an upright judge a learnèd judge a second daniel a daniel jew now infidel i have you on the hip a daniel still say i a second daniel  i thank thee jew for teaching me that word beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself and yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state thou hast not left the value of a cord therefore thou must be hanged at the state's charge a halter gratis nothing else for god's sake in christ'ning shalt thou have two godfathers had i been judge thou shouldst have had ten more to bring thee to the gallows not to the font fair sir you are well o'erta'en my lord bassanio upon more advice hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat your company at dinner that will i do by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong in faith i gave it to the judge's clerk would he were gelt that had it for my part since you do take it love so much at heart about a hoop of gold a paltry ring that she did give me whose posy was for all the world like cutler's poetry upon a knife love me and leave me not he will an if he live to be a man now by this hand i gave it to a youth a kind of boy a little scrubbèd boy no higher than thyself the judge's clerk a prating boy that begged it as a fee i could not for my heart deny it him my lord bassanio gave his ring away unto the judge that begged it and indeed deserved it too and then the boy his clerk that took some pains in writing he begged mine and neither man nor master would take aught but the two rings well do you so let not me take him then for if i do i'll mar the young clerk's pen why this is like the mending of highways in summer where the ways are fair enough what are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold let it be so the first inter'gatory that my nerissa shall be sworn on is whether till the next night she had rather stay or go to bed now being two hours to day but were the day come i should wish it dark till i were couching with the doctor's clerk well while i live i'll fear no other thing so sore as keeping safe nerissa's ring
