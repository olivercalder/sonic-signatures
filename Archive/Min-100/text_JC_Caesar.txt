calphurnia calphurnia stand you directly in antonius' way when he doth run his course antonius forget not in your speed antonius to touch calphurnia for our elders say the barren touchèd in this holy chase shake off their sterile curse set on and leave no ceremony out ha who calls who is it in the press that calls on me i hear a tongue shriller than all the music cry caesar speak caesar is turned to hear what man is that set him before me let me see his face what sayst thou to me now speak once again he is a dreamer let us leave him pass antonius let me have men about me that are fat sleek headed men and such as sleep a nights yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous would he were fatter but i fear him not yet if my name were liable to fear i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius he reads much he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays as thou dost antony he hears no music seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit that could be moved to smile at anything such men as he be never at heart's ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves and therefore are they very dangerous i rather tell thee what is to be feared than what i fear for always i am caesar come on my right hand for this ear is deaf and tell me truly what thou think'st of him nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight thrice hath calphurnia in her sleep cried out help ho they murder caesar who's within go bid the priests do present sacrifice and bring me their opinions of success caesar shall forth the things that threatened me ne'er looked but on my back when they shall see the face of caesar they are vanishèd what can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once of all the wonders that i yet have heard it seems to me most strange that men should fear seeing that death a necessary end will come when it will come what say the augurers the gods do this in shame of cowardice caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear no caesar shall not danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he we are two lions littered in one day and i the elder and more terrible and caesar shall go forth mark antony shall say i am not well and for thy humor i will stay at home here's decius brutus he shall tell them so and you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come today cannot is false and that i dare not falser i will not come today tell them so decius shall caesar send a lie have i in conquest stretched mine arm so far to be afeard to tell graybeards the truth decius go tell them caesar will not come the cause is in my will i will not come that is enough to satisfy the senate but for your private satisfaction because i love you i will let you know calphurnia here my wife stays me at home she dreamt tonight she saw my statue which like a fountain with an hundred spouts did run pure blood and many lusty romans came smiling and did bathe their hands in it and these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent and on her knee hath begged that i will stay at home today and this way have you well expounded it how foolish do your fears seem now calphurnia i am ashamèd i did yield to them give me my robe for i will go and look where publius is come to fetch me welcome publius  what brutus are you stirred so early too  good morrow casca caius ligarius caesar was ne'er so much your enemy as that same ague which hath made you lean  what is 't o'clock i thank you for your pains and courtesy see antony that revels long a nights is notwithstanding up good morrow antony bid them prepare within  i am to blame to be thus waited for now cinna now metellus what trebonius i have an hour's talk in store for you remember that you call on me today be near me that i may remember you good friends go in and taste some wine with me and we like friends will straightway go together the ides of march are come what touches us ourself shall be last served what is the fellow mad are we all ready what is now amiss that caesar and his senate must redress i must prevent thee cimber these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men and turn preordinance and first decree into the law of children be not fond to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thawed from the true quality with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words low crookèd curtsies and base spaniel fawning thy brother by decree is banishèd if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him i spurn thee like a cur out of my way know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause will he be satisfied what brutus i could be well moved if i were as you if i could pray to move prayers would move me but i am constant as the northern star of whose true fixed and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament the skies are painted with unnumbered sparks they are all fire and every one doth shine but there's but one in all doth hold his place so in the world 'tis furnished well with men and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive yet in the number i do know but one that unassailable holds on his rank unshaked of motion and that i am he let me a little show it even in this that i was constant cimber should be banished and constant do remain to keep him so hence wilt thou lift up olympus doth not brutus bootless kneel et tu brutè then fall caesar thy evil spirit brutus to tell thee thou shalt see me at philippi ay at philippi
