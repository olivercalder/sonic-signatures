search my wound poor bassianus here lies murderèd an if we miss to meet him handsomely sweet huntsman bassianus 'tis we mean  do thou so much as dig the grave for him thou know'st our meaning look for thy reward among the nettles at the elder tree which overshades the mouth of that same pit where we decreed to bury bassianus do this and purchase us thy lasting friends o tamora was ever heard the like this is the pit and this the elder tree  look sirs if you can find the huntsman out that should have murdered bassianus here two of thy whelps fell curs of bloody kind have here bereft my brother of his life  sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison there let them bide until we have devised some never heard of torturing pain for them if it be proved you see it is apparent who found this letter tamora was it you thou shalt not bail them see thou follow me  some bring the murdered body some the murderers let them not speak a word the guilt is plain for by my soul were there worse end than death that end upon them should be executed why lords what wrongs are these was ever seen an emperor in rome thus overborne troubled confronted thus and for the extent of equal justice used in such contempt my lords you know as know the mightful gods however these disturbers of our peace buzz in the people's ears there naught hath passed but even with law against the willful sons of old andronicus and what an if his sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks his fits his frenzy and his bitterness and now he writes to heaven for his redress see here's to jove and this to mercury this to apollo this to the god of war sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of rome what's this but libeling against the senate and blazoning our unjustice everywhere a goodly humor is it not my lords as who would say in rome no justice were but if i live his feignèd ecstasies shall be no shelter to these outrages but he and his shall know that justice lives in saturninus' health whom if he sleep he'll so awake as he in fury shall cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives go take him away and hang him presently despiteful and intolerable wrongs shall i endure this monstrous villainy i know from whence this same device proceeds may this be borne as if his traitorous sons that died by law for murder of our brother have by my means been butchered wrongfully go drag the villain hither by the hair nor age nor honor shall shape privilege for this proud mock i'll be thy slaughterman sly frantic wretch that holp'st to make me great in hope thyself should govern rome and me what news with thee aemilius is warlike lucius general of the goths these tidings nip me and i hang the head as flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms ay now begins our sorrows to approach 'tis he the common people love so much myself hath often heard them say when i have walkèd like a private man that lucius' banishment was wrongfully and they have wished that lucius were their emperor ay but the citizens favor lucius and will revolt from me to succor him but he will not entreat his son for us aemilius do this message honorably and if he stand in hostage for his safety bid him demand what pledge will please him best then go successantly and plead to him what hath the firmament more suns than one marcus we will why art thou thus attired andronicus it was andronicus because the girl should not survive her shame and by her presence still renew his sorrows what hast thou done unnatural and unkind what was she ravished tell who did the deed go fetch them hither to us presently die frantic wretch for this accursèd deed
