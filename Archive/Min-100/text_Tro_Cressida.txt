who were those went by and whither go they what was his cause of anger good and what of him so do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legs but how should this man that makes me smile make hector angry who comes here hector's a gallant man good morrow uncle pandarus this morning uncle hector was gone but helen was not up that were we talking of and of his anger so he says here what is he angry too o jupiter there's no comparison ay if i ever saw him before and knew him then you say as i say for i am sure he is not hector 'tis just to each of them he is himself so he is he is not hector excuse me pardon me pardon me he shall not need it if he have his own no matter 'twould not become him his own 's better no but brown to say the truth true and not true why paris hath color enough then troilus should have too much if she praised him above his complexion is higher than his he having color enough and the other higher is too flaming a praise for a good complexion i had as lief helen's golden tongue had commended troilus for a copper nose then she's a merry greek indeed indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total is he so young a man and so old a lifter juno have mercy how came it cloven o he smiles valiantly o yes an 'twere a cloud in autumn troilus will stand to the proof if you'll prove it so if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head you would eat chickens i' th' shell without the rack alas poor chin many a wart is richer with millstones but there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes did her eyes run o'er too at what was all this laughing an 't had been a green hair i should have laughed too what was his answer this is her question so let it now for it has been a great while going by so i do and i'll spring up in his tears an 'twere a nettle against may at your pleasure speak not so loud who's that will he give you the nod if he do the rich shall have more o a brave man be those with swords who's that can helenus fight uncle what sneaking fellow comes yonder peace for shame peace here comes more there is amongst the greeks achilles a better man than troilus well well ay a minced man and then to be baked with no date in the pie for then the man's date is out upon my back to defend my belly upon my wit to defend my wiles upon my secrecy to defend mine honesty my mask to defend my beauty and you to defend all these and at all these wards i lie at a thousand watches nay i'll watch you for that and that's one of the chiefest of them too if i cannot ward what i would not have hit i can watch you for telling how i took the blow unless it swell past hiding and then it's past watching adieu uncle to bring uncle by the same token you are a bawd words vows gifts tears and love's full sacrifice he offers in another's enterprise but more in troilus thousandfold i see than in the glass of pandar's praise may be yet hold i off women are angels wooing things won are done joy's soul lies in the doing that she beloved knows naught that knows not this men prize the thing ungained more than it is that she was never yet that ever knew love got so sweet as when desire did sue therefore this maxim out of love i teach achievement is command ungained beseech then though my heart's content firm love doth bear nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear will you walk in my lord wished my lord the gods grant o my lord more dregs than water if my fears have eyes blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear to fear the worst oft cures the worse nor nothing monstrous neither they say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one they that have the voice of lions and the act of hares are they not monsters will you walk in my lord well uncle what folly i commit i dedicate to you boldness comes to me now and brings me heart prince troilus i have loved you night and day for many weary months hard to seem won but i was won my lord with the first glance that ever pardon me if i confess much you will play the tyrant i love you now but till now not so much but i might master it in faith i lie my thoughts were like unbridled children grown too headstrong for their mother see we fools why have i blabbed who shall be true to us when we are so unsecret to ourselves but though i loved you well i wooed you not and yet good faith i wished myself a man or that we women had men's privilege of speaking first sweet bid me hold my tongue for in this rapture i shall surely speak the thing i shall repent see see your silence cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws my very soul of counsel stop my mouth my lord i do beseech you pardon me 'twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss i am ashamed o heavens what have i done for this time will i take my leave my lord pray you content you sir mine own company let me go and try i have a kind of self resides with you but an unkind self that itself will leave to be another's fool i would be gone where is my wit i know not what i speak perchance my lord i show more craft than love and fell so roundly to a large confession to angle for your thoughts but you are wise or else you love not for to be wise and love exceeds man's might that dwells with gods above in that i'll war with you prophet may you be if i be false or swerve a hair from truth when time is old and hath forgot itself when water drops have worn the stones of troy and blind oblivion swallowed cities up and mighty states characterless are grated to dusty nothing yet let memory from false to false among false maids in love upbraid my falsehood when they've said as false as air as water wind or sandy earth as fox to lamb or wolf to heifer's calf pard to the hind or stepdame to her son yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood as false as cressid amen then sweet my lord i'll call mine uncle down he shall unbolt the gates good morrow then are you aweary of me night hath been too brief prithee tarry you men will never tarry o foolish cressid i might have still held off and then you would have tarried hark there's one up a pestilence on him now will he be mocking i shall have such a life go hang yourself you naughty mocking uncle you bring me to do and then you flout me too come come beshrew your heart you'll ne'er be good nor suffer others did not i tell you would he were knocked i' th' head who's that at door good uncle go and see  my lord come you again into my chamber you smile and mock me as if i meant naughtily come you are deceived i think of no such thing how earnestly they knock pray you come in i would not for half troy have you seen here how now what's the matter who was here why sigh you so profoundly where's my lord gone tell me sweet uncle what's the matter o the gods what's the matter good uncle i beseech you on my knees i beseech you what's the matter o you immortal gods i will not go i will not uncle i have forgot my father i know no touch of consanguinity no kin no love no blood no soul so near me as the sweet troilus o you gods divine make cressid's name the very crown of falsehood if ever she leave troilus time force and death do to this body what extremes you can but the strong base and building of my love is as the very center of the earth drawing all things to it i'll go in and weep  tear my bright hair and scratch my prais√®d cheeks crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart with sounding troilus i will not go from troy why tell you me of moderation the grief is fine full perfect that i taste and violenteth in a sense as strong as that which causeth it how can i moderate it if i could temporize with my affection or brew it to a weak and colder palate the like allayment could i give my grief my love admits no qualifying dross no more my grief in such a precious loss o troilus troilus have the gods envy and is it true that i must go from troy what and from troilus too is 't possible i must then to the grecians a woeful cressid 'mongst the merry greeks when shall we see again i true how now what wicked deem is this o you shall be exposed my lord to dangers as infinite as imminent but i'll be true and you this glove when shall i see you o heavens be true again o heavens you love me not do you think i will my lord will you be true in kissing do you render or receive i'll make my match to live the kiss you take is better than you give therefore no kiss you are an odd man give even or give none no paris is not for you know 'tis true that you are odd and he is even with you no i'll be sworn you may why beg two i am your debtor claim it when 'tis due now my sweet guardian hark a word with you remember yes sweet honey greek tempt me no more to folly i'll tell you what  in faith i cannot what would you have me do i prithee do not hold me to mine oath bid me do anything but that sweet greek diomed  hark a word in your ear nay but you part in anger guardian why greek in faith i do not come hither once again in faith i will la never trust me else i'll fetch you one here diomed keep this sleeve you look upon that sleeve behold it well he loved me o false wench give 't me again it is no matter now i ha 't again i will not meet with you tomorrow night i prithee diomed visit me no more what this o all you gods o pretty pretty pledge thy master now lies thinking on his bed of thee and me and sighs and takes my glove and gives memorial dainty kisses to it as i kiss thee he that takes that doth take my heart withal you shall not have it diomed faith you shall not i'll give you something else it is no matter 'twas one's that loved me better than you will but now you have it take it by all diana's waiting women yond and by herself i will not tell you whose well well 'tis done 'tis past and yet it is not i will not keep my word you shall not go one cannot speak a word but it straight starts you ay come o jove do come i shall be plagued good night i prithee come  troilus farewell one eye yet looks on thee but with my heart the other eye doth see ah poor our sex this fault in us i find the error of our eye directs our mind what error leads must err o then conclude minds swayed by eyes are full of turpitude
