sequence of posterity outfacèd infant state and done a rape upon the maiden virtue of the crown look here upon thy brother geoffrey's face these eyes these brows were molded out of his this little abstract doth contain that large which died in geoffrey and the hand of time shall draw this brief into as huge a volume that geoffrey was thy elder brother born and this his son england was geoffrey's right and this is geoffrey's in the name of god how comes it then that thou art called a king when living blood doth in these temples beat which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest from that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts in any breast of strong authority to look into the blots and stains of right that judge hath made me guardian to this boy under whose warrant i impeach thy

holds stands young plantagenet son to the elder brother of this man and king o'er him and all that he enjoys for this downtrodden equity we tread in warlike march these greens before your town being no further enemy to you than the constraint of hospitable zeal in the relief of this oppressèd child religiously provokes be pleasèd then to pay that duty which you truly owe to him that owes it namely this young prince and then our arms like to a muzzled bear save in aspect hath all offense sealed up our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent against th' invulnerable clouds of heaven and with a blessèd and unvexed retire with unbacked swords and helmets all unbruised we will bear home that lusty blood again which here we came to spout against your town and leave your children wives and you in peace but if you fondly pass our proffered offer 'tis not the roundure of your old faced walls can hide you from our messengers of war though all these english and their discipline were harbored in their rude circumference then tell us shall your city call us lord in that behalf which we have challenged it or shall we give the signal to our rage and stalk in blood to our possession as many and as wellborn bloods as those  stand in his face to contradict his claim amen amen mount chevaliers to arms it shall be so and at the other hill command the rest to stand god and our right england thou hast not saved one drop of blood in this hot trial more than we of france rather lost more and by this hand i swear that sways the earth this climate overlooks before we will lay down our just borne arms we'll put thee down 'gainst whom these arms we bear or add a royal number to the dead gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss with slaughter coupled to the name of kings speak citizens for england who's your king know him in us that here hold up his right let it be so say where will you assault our thunder from the south shall rain their drift of bullets on this town speak england

may we content this widow lady in her right we came which we god knows have turned another way to our own vantage 'tis true fair daughter and this blessèd day ever in france shall be kept festival to solemnize this day the glorious sun stays in his course and plays the alchemist turning with splendor of his precious eye the meager cloddy earth to glittering gold the yearly course that brings this day about shall never see it but a holy day by heaven lady you shall have no cause to curse the fair proceedings of this day have i not pawned to you my majesty here comes the holy legate of the pope brother of england you blaspheme in this i am perplexed and know not what to say good reverend father make my person yours and tell me how you would bestow yourself this royal hand and mine are newly knit and the conjunction of our inward souls married in league coupled and linked together with all religious strength of sacred vows the latest breath that gave the sound of words was deep sworn faith peace amity true love between our kingdoms and our royal selves and even before this truce but new before no longer than we well could wash our hands to clap this royal bargain up of peace god knows they were besmeared and overstained with slaughter's pencil where revenge did paint the fearful difference of incensèd kings and shall these hands so lately purged of blood so newly joined in love so strong in both unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven make such unconstant children of ourselves as now again to snatch our palm from palm unswear faith sworn and on the marriage bed of smiling peace to march a bloody host and make a riot on the gentle brow of true sincerity o holy sir my reverend father let it not be so out of your grace devise ordain impose some gentle order and then we shall be blest to do your pleasure and continue friends i may disjoin my hand but not my faith thou shalt not need england i will fall from thee thy rage shall burn thee up and thou shalt turn to ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire look to thyself thou art in jeopardy so by a roaring tempest on the flood a whole armada of convicted sail is scattered and disjoined from fellowship what can go well when we have run so ill are we not beaten is not angiers lost arthur ta'en prisoner divers dear friends slain and bloody england into england gone o'erbearing interruption spite of france well could i bear that england had this praise so we could find some pattern of our shame look who comes here a grave unto a soul holding th' eternal spirit against her will in the vile prison of afflicted breath  i prithee lady go away with me patience good lady comfort gentle constance o fair affliction peace bind up those tresses o what love i note in the fair multitude of those her hairs where but by chance a silver drop hath fall'n even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends do glue themselves in sociable grief like true inseparable faithful loves sticking together in calamity bind up your hairs you are as fond of grief as of your child i fear some outrage and i'll follow her
