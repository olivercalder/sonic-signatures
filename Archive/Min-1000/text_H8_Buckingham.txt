good morrow and well met how have you done since last we saw in france an untimely ague stayed me a prisoner in my chamber when those suns of glory those two lights of men met in the vale of andren all the whole time i was my chamber's prisoner o you go far who did guide i mean who set the body and the limbs of this great sport together as you guess i pray you who my lord the devil speed him no man's pie is freed from his ambitious finger what had he to do in these fierce vanities i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o' th' beneficial sun and keep it from the earth why the devil upon this french going out took he upon him without the privity o' th' king t' appoint who should attend on him he makes up the file of all the gentry for the most part such to whom as great a charge as little honor he meant to lay upon and his own letter the honorable board of council out must fetch him in he papers o many have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em for this great journey what did this vanity but minister communication of a most poor issue every man after the hideous storm that followed was a thing inspired and not consulting broke into a general prophecy that this tempest dashing the garment of this peace aboded the sudden breach on 't why all this business our reverend cardinal carried this butcher's cur is venomed mouthed and i have not the power to muzzle him therefore best not wake him in his slumber a beggar's book outworths a noble's blood i read in 's looks matter against me and his eye reviled me as his abject object at this instant he bores me with some trick he's gone to th' king i'll follow and outstare him i'll to the king and from a mouth of honor quite cry down this ipswich fellow's insolence or proclaim there's difference in no persons sir i am thankful to you and i'll go along by your prescription but this top proud fellow  whom from the flow of gall i name not but from sincere motions by intelligence and proofs as clear as founts in july when we see each grain of gravel i do know to be corrupt and treasonous to th' king i'll say 't and make my vouch as strong as shore of rock attend this holy fox or wolf or both for he is equal rav'nous as he is subtle and as prone to mischief as able to perform 't his mind and place infecting one another yea reciprocally  only to show his pomp as well in france as here at home suggests the king our master to this last costly treaty th' interview that swallowed so much treasure and like a glass did break i' th' rinsing pray give me favor sir this cunning cardinal the articles o' th' combination drew as himself pleased and they were ratified as he cried thus let be to as much end as give a crutch to th' dead but our count cardinal has done this and 'tis well for worthy wolsey who cannot err he did it now this follows  which as i take it is a kind of puppy to th' old dam treason charles the emperor under pretense to see the queen his aunt  for 'twas indeed his color but he came to whisper wolsey here makes visitation his fears were that the interview betwixt england and france might through their amity breed him some prejudice for from this league peeped harms that menaced him privily deals with our cardinal and as i trow  which i do well for i am sure the emperor paid ere he promised whereby his suit was granted ere it was asked but when the way was made and paved with gold the emperor thus desired that he would please to alter the king's course and break the foresaid peace let the king know  as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal does buy and sell his honor as he pleases and for his own advantage no not a syllable i do pronounce him in that very shape he shall appear in proof lo you my lord the net has fall'n upon me i shall perish under device and practice it will help me nothing to plead mine innocence for that dye is on me which makes my whit'st part black the will of heaven be done in this and all things i obey o my lord abergavenny fare you well so so these are the limbs o' th' plot no more i hope o michael hopkins my surveyor is false the o'ergreat cardinal hath showed him gold my life is spanned already i am the shadow of poor buckingham whose figure even this instant cloud puts on by dark'ning my clear sun my lord farewell all good people you that thus far have come to pity me hear what i say and then go home and lose me i have this day received a traitor's judgment and by that name must die yet heaven bear witness and if i have a conscience let it sink me even as the ax falls if i be not faithful the law i bear no malice for my death 't has done upon the premises but justice but those that sought it i could wish more christian be what they will i heartily forgive 'em yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief nor build their evils on the graves of great men for then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em for further life in this world i ne'er hope nor will i sue although the king have mercies more than i dare make faults you few that loved me and dare be bold to weep for buckingham his noble friends and fellows whom to leave is only bitter to him only dying go with me like good angels to my end and as the long divorce of steel falls on me make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice and lift my soul to heaven lead on a' god's name sir thomas lovell i as free forgive you as i would be forgiven i forgive all there cannot be those numberless offenses 'gainst me that i cannot take peace with no black envy shall make my grave commend me to his grace and if he speak of buckingham pray tell him you met him half in heaven my vows and prayers yet are the king's and till my soul forsake shall cry for blessings on him may he live longer than i have time to tell his years ever beloved and loving may his rule be and when old time shall lead him to his end goodness and he fill up one monument nay sir nicholas let it alone my state now will but mock me when i came hither i was lord high constable and duke of buckingham now poor edward bohun yet i am richer than my base accusers that never knew what truth meant i now seal it and with that blood will make 'em one day groan for 't my noble father henry of buckingham who first raised head against usurping richard flying for succor to his servant banister being distressed was by that wretch betrayed and without trial fell god's peace be with him henry the seventh succeeding truly pitying my father's loss like a most royal prince restored me to my honors and out of ruins made my name once more noble now his son henry the eighth life honor name and all that made me happy at one stroke has taken forever from the world i had my trial and must needs say a noble one which makes me a little happier than my wretched father yet thus far we are one in fortunes both fell by our servants by those men we loved most  a most unnatural and faithless service heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me this from a dying man receive as certain where you are liberal of your loves and counsels be sure you be not loose for those you make friends and give your hearts to when they once perceive the least rub in your fortunes fall away like water from you never found again but where they mean to sink you all good people pray for me i must now forsake you the last hour of my long weary life is come upon me farewell and when you would say something that is sad speak how i fell i have done and god forgive me
