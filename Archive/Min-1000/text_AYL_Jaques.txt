more more i prithee more i thank it more i prithee more i can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs more i prithee more i do not desire you to please me i do desire you to sing come more another stanzo call you 'em stanzos nay i care not for their names they owe me nothing will you sing well then if ever i thank any man i'll thank you but that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two dog apes and when a man thanks me heartily methinks i have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks come sing and you that will not hold your tongues and i have been all this day to avoid him he is too disputable for my company i think of as many matters as he but i give heaven thanks and make no boast of them come warble come who doth ambition shun and loves to live i' th' sun seeking the food he eats and pleased with what he gets come hither come hither come hither here shall he see no enemy but winter and rough weather i'll give you a verse to this note that i made yesterday in despite of my invention thus it goes if it do come to pass that any man turn ass leaving his wealth and ease a stubborn will to please ducdame ducdame ducdame here shall he see gross fools as he an if he will come to me 'tis a greek invocation to call fools into a circle i'll go sleep if i can if i cannot i'll rail against all the first born of egypt a fool a fool i met a fool i' th' forest a motley fool a miserable world as i do live by food i met a fool who laid him down and basked him in the sun and railed on lady fortune in good terms in good set terms and yet a motley fool good morrow fool quoth i no sir quoth he call me not fool' till heaven hath sent me fortune and then he drew a dial from his poke and looking on it with lack luster eye says very wisely it is ten o'clock thus we may see quoth he how the world wags 'tis but an hour ago since it was nine and after one hour more 'twill be eleven and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and then from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time my lungs began to crow like chanticleer that fools should be so deep contemplative and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial o noble fool a worthy fool motley's the only wear o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier and says if ladies be but young and fair they have the gift to know it and in his brain which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage he hath strange places crammed with observation the which he vents in mangled forms o that i were a fool i am ambitious for a motley coat it is my only suit provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise i must have liberty withal as large a charter as the wind to blow on whom i please for so fools have and they that are most gallèd with my folly they most must laugh and why sir must they so the why is plain as way to parish church he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly although he smart not to seem senseless of the bob if not the wise man's folly is anatomized even by the squand'ring glances of the fool invest me in my motley give me leave to speak my mind and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of th' infected world if they will patiently receive my medicine what for a counter would i do but good why who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party doth it not flow as hugely as the sea till that the weary very means do ebb what woman in the city do i name when that i say the city woman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders who can come in and say that i mean her when such a one as she such is her neighbor or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not on my cost thinking that i mean him but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech there then how then what then let me see wherein my tongue hath wronged him if it do him right then he hath wronged himself if he be free why then my taxing like a wild goose flies unclaimed of any man but who comes here why i have eat none yet of what kind should this cock come of an you will not be answered with reason i must die all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurse's arms then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress' eyebrow then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honor sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon's mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lined with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slippered pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well saved a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything i thank you for your company but good faith i had as lief have been myself alone god be wi' you let's meet as little as we can i pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks rosalind is your love's name i do not like her name what stature is she of you are full of pretty answers have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives and conned them out of rings you have a nimble wit i think 'twas made of atalanta's heels will you sit down with me and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery the worst fault you have is to be in love by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found you there i shall see mine own figure i'll tarry no longer with you farewell good signior love o knowledge ill inhabited worse than jove in a thatched house a material fool i would fain see this meeting proceed proceed i'll give her will you be married motley and will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp go thou with me and let me counsel thee i prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with thee i am so i do love it better than laughing why 'tis good to be sad and say nothing i have neither the scholar's melancholy which is emulation nor the musician's which is fantastical nor the courtier's which is proud nor the soldier's which is ambitious nor the lawyer's which is politic nor the lady's which is nice nor the lover's which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness yes i have gained my experience nay then god be wi' you an you talk in blank verse which is he that killed the deer let's present him to the duke like a roman conqueror and it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a branch of victory have you no song forester for this purpose sing it 'tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enough there is sure another flood toward and these couples are coming to the ark here comes a pair of very strange beasts which in all tongues are called fools good my lord bid him welcome this is the motley minded gentleman that i have so often met in the forest he hath been a courtier he swears and how was that ta'en up how seventh cause good my lord like this fellow but for the seventh cause how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie is not this a rare fellow my lord he's as good at anything and yet a fool sir by your patience if i heard you rightly the duke hath put on a religious life and thrown into neglect the pompous court to him will i out of these convertites there is much matter to be heard and learned you to your former honor i bequeath your patience and your virtue well deserves it you to a love that your true faith doth merit you to your land and love and great allies you to a long and well deservèd bed and you to wrangling for thy loving voyage is but for two months victualled so to your pleasures i am for other than for dancing measures to see no pastime i what you would have i'll stay to know at your abandoned cave
