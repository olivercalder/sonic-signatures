great king of england and my gracious lord the mutual conference that my mind hath had by day by night waking and in my dreams in courtly company or at my beads with you mine alderliefest sovereign makes me the bolder to salute my king with ruder terms such as my wit affords and overjoy of heart doth minister we thank you all to my lord protector are your supplications to his lordship let me see them what is thine what sayst thou did the duke of york say he was rightful heir to the crown and as for you that love to be protected under the wings of our protector's grace begin your suits anew and sue to him away base cullions suffolk let them go my lord of suffolk say is this the guise is this the fashions in the court of england is this the government of britain's isle and this the royalty of albion's king what shall king henry be a pupil still under the surly gloucester's governance am i a queen in title and in style and must be made a subject to a duke i tell thee pole when in the city tours thou rann'st atilt in honor of my love and stol'st away the ladies' hearts of france i thought king henry had resembled thee in courage courtship and proportion but all his mind is bent to holiness to number ave marys on his beads his champions are the prophets and apostles his weapons holy saws of sacred writ his study is his tiltyard and his loves are brazen images of canonized saints i would the college of the cardinals would choose him pope and carry him to rome and set the triple crown upon his head that were a state fit for his holiness besides the haughty protector have we beaufort the imperious churchman somerset buckingham and grumbling york and not the least of these but can do more in england than the king not all these lords do vex me half so much as that proud dame the lord protector's wife she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies more like an empress than duke humphrey's wife strangers in court do take her for the queen she bears a duke's revenues on her back and in her heart she scorns our poverty shall i not live to be avenged on her contemptuous baseborn callet as she is she vaunted 'mongst her minions t' other day the very train of her worst wearing gown was better worth than all my father's lands till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter because the king forsooth will have it so if he be old enough what needs your grace to be protector of his excellence thy sale of offices and towns in france if they were known as the suspect is great would make thee quickly hop without thy head give me my fan what minion can you not i cry you mercy madam was it you believe me lords for flying at the brook i saw not better sport these seven years' day yet by your leave the wind was very high and ten to one old joan had not gone out and thy ambition gloucester tell me good fellow cam'st thou here by chance or of devotion to this holy shrine it made me laugh to see the villain run gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest and look thyself be faultless thou wert best i see no reason why a king of years should be to be protected like a child god and king henry govern england's realm  give up your staff sir and the king his realm why now is henry king and margaret queen and humphrey duke of gloucester scarce himself that bears so shrewd a maim two pulls at once his lady banished and a limb lopped off this staff of honor raught there let it stand where it best fits to be in henry's hand ay good my lord for purposely therefor left i the court to see this quarrel tried can you not see or will you not observe the strangeness of his altered countenance with what a majesty he bears himself how insolent of late he is become how proud how peremptory and unlike himself we know the time since he was mild and affable and if we did but glance a far off look immediately he was upon his knee that all the court admired him for submission but meet him now and be it in the morn when everyone will give the time of day he knits his brow and shows an angry eye and passeth by with stiff unbowèd knee disdaining duty that to us belongs small curs are not regarded when they grin but great men tremble when the lion roars  and humphrey is no little man in england first note that he is near you in descent and should you fall he is the next will mount meseemeth then it is no policy respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness' council by flattery hath he won the commons' hearts and when he please to make commotion 'tis to be feared they all will follow him now 'tis the spring and weeds are shallow rooted suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden and choke the herbs for want of husbandry the reverent care i bear unto my lord made me collect these dangers in the duke if it be fond call it a woman's fear which fear if better reasons can supplant i will subscribe and say i wronged the duke my lords of suffolk buckingham and york reprove my allegation if you can or else conclude my words effectual ah what's more dangerous than this fond affiance seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed for he's disposèd as the hateful raven is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him for he's inclined as is the ravenous wolves who cannot steal a shape that means deceit take heed my lord the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man but i can give the loser leave to chide what will your highness leave the parliament free lords cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams henry my lord is cold in great affairs too full of foolish pity and gloucester's show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers or as the snake rolled in a flow'ring bank with shining checkered slough doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent believe me lords were none more wise than i  and yet herein i judge mine own wit good  this gloucester should be quickly rid the world to rid us from the fear we have of him so the poor chicken should be sure of death thrice noble suffolk 'tis resolutely spoke and so say i nay then this spark will prove a raging fire if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with  no more good york sweet somerset be still  thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there might happily have proved far worse than his god forbid any malice should prevail that faultless may condemn a nobleman pray god he may acquit him of suspicion marry god forfend how fares my lord help lords the king is dead run go help help o henry ope thine eyes how fares my gracious lord why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus although the duke was enemy to him yet he most christian like laments his death and for myself foe as he was to me might liquid tears or heart offending groans or blood consuming sighs recall his life i would be blind with weeping sick with groans look pale as primrose with blood drinking sighs and all to have the noble duke alive what know i how the world may deem of me for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judged i made the duke away so shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded and princes' courts be filled with my reproach this get i by his death ay me unhappy to be a queen and crowned with infamy be woe for me more wretched than he is what dost thou turn away and hide thy face i am no loathsome leper look on me what art thou like the adder waxen deaf be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen is all thy comfort shut in gloucester's tomb why then dame margaret was ne'er thy joy erect his statue and worship it and make my image but an alehouse sign was i for this nigh wracked upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from england's bank drove back again unto my native clime what boded this but well forewarning wind did seem to say seek not a scorpion's nest nor set no footing on this unkind shore what did i then but cursed the gentle gusts and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards england's blessèd shore or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock yet aeolus would not be a murderer but left that hateful office unto thee the pretty vaulting sea refused to drown me knowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shore with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cow'red in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides because thy flinty heart more hard than they might in thy palace perish margaret as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs when from thy shore the tempest beat us back i stood upon the hatches in the storm and when the dusky sky began to rob my earnest gaping sight of thy land's view i took a costly jewel from my neck  a heart it was bound in with diamonds  and threw it towards thy land the sea received it and so i wished thy body might my heart and even with this i lost fair england's view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and called them blind and dusky spectacles for losing ken of albion's wishèd coast how often have i tempted suffolk's tongue the agent of thy foul inconstancy to sit and watch me as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his father's acts commenced in burning troy am i not witched like her or thou not false like him ay me i can no more die margaret for henry weeps that thou dost live so long then you belike suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphrey's timeless death are you the butcher suffolk where's your knife is beaufort termed a kite where are his talons he dares not calm his contumelious spirit nor cease to be an arrogant controller though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times what noise is this o henry let me plead for gentle suffolk mischance and sorrow go along with you heart's discontent and sour affliction be playfellows to keep you company there's two of you the devil make a third and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps fie coward woman and soft hearted wretch hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemies enough sweet suffolk thou torment'st thyself and these dread curses like the sun 'gainst glass or like an over chargèd gun recoil and turn the force of them upon thyself o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand that i may dew it with my mournful tears nor let the rain of heaven wet this place to wash away my woeful monuments o could this kiss be printed in thy hand that thou mightst think upon these by the seal through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee so get thee gone that i may know my grief 'tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by as one that surfeits thinking on a want i will repeal thee or be well assured adventure to be banishèd myself and banishèd i am if but from thee go speak not to me even now be gone o go not yet even thus two friends condemned embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves loather a hundred times to part than die yet now farewell and farewell life with thee whither goes vaux so fast what news i prithee go tell this heavy message to the king ay me what is this world what news are these but wherefore grieve i at an hour's poor loss omitting suffolk's exile my soul's treasure why only suffolk mourn i not for thee and with the southern clouds contend in tears  theirs for the earth's increase mine for my sorrows' now get thee hence the king thou know'st is coming if thou be found by me thou art but dead away though parting be a fretful corrosive it is applièd to a deathful wound to france sweet suffolk let me hear from thee for wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe i'll have an iris that shall find thee out and take my heart with thee this way for me oft have i heard that grief softens the mind and makes it fearful and degenerate think therefore on revenge and cease to weep but who can cease to weep and look on this here may his head lie on my throbbing breast but where's the body that i should embrace ah barbarous villains hath this lovely face ruled like a wandering planet over me and could it not enforce them to relent that were unworthy to behold the same no my love i should not mourn but die for thee ah were the duke of suffolk now alive these kentish rebels would be soon appeased my hope is gone now suffolk is deceased for thousand yorks he shall not hide his head but boldly stand and front him to his face call hither clifford bid him come amain to say if that the bastard boys of york shall be the surety for their traitor father and here comes clifford to deny their bail he is arrested but will not obey his sons he says shall give their words for him a subtle traitor needs no sophister away my lord you are slow for shame away what are you made of you'll nor fight nor fly now is it manhood wisdom and defense to give the enemy way and to secure us by what we can which can no more but fly if you be ta'en we then should see the bottom of all our fortunes but if we haply scape as well we may if not through your neglect  we shall to london get where you are loved and where this breach now in our fortunes made may readily be stopped
