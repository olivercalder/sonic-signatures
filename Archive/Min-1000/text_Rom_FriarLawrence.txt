the gray eyed morn smiles on the frowning night check'ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light and fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels from forth day's path and titan's fiery wheels now ere the sun advance his burning eye the day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry i must upfill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and precious juicèd flowers the earth that's nature's mother is her tomb what is her burying grave that is her womb and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find many for many virtues excellent none but for some and yet all different o mickle is the powerful grace that lies in plants herbs stones and their true qualities for naught so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give nor aught so good but strained from that fair use revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse virtue itself turns vice being misapplied and vice sometime by action dignified within the infant rind of this weak flower poison hath residence and medicine power for this being smelt with that part cheers each part being tasted stays all senses with the heart two such opposèd kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs grace and rude will and where the worser is predominant full soon the canker death eats up that plant benedicite what early tongue so sweet saluteth me young son it argues a distempered head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed care keeps his watch in every old man's eye and where care lodges sleep will never lie but where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uproused with some distemp'rature or if not so then here i hit it right our romeo hath not been in bed tonight god pardon sin wast thou with rosaline that's my good son but where hast thou been then be plain good son and homely in thy drift riddling confession finds but riddling shrift holy saint francis what a change is here is rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes jesu maria what a deal of brine hath washed thy sallow cheeks for rosaline how much salt water thrown away in waste to season love that of it doth not taste the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears thy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not washed off yet if e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine thou and these woes were all for rosaline and art thou changed pronounce this sentence then women may fall when there's no strength in men for doting not for loving pupil mine not in a grave to lay one in another out to have o she knew well thy love did read by rote that could not spell but come young waverer come go with me in one respect i'll thy assistant be for this alliance may so happy prove to turn your households' rancor to pure love wisely and slow they stumble that run fast so smile the heavens upon this holy act that after hours with sorrow chide us not these violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph die like fire and powder which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness and in the taste confounds the appetite therefore love moderately long love doth so too swift arrives as tardy as too slow here comes the lady o so light a foot will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint a lover may bestride the gossamers that idles in the wanton summer air and yet not fall so light is vanity romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both come come with me and we will make short work for by your leaves you shall not stay alone till holy church incorporate two in one romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man affliction is enamored of thy parts and thou art wedded to calamity too familiar is my dear son with such sour company i bring thee tidings of the prince's doom a gentler judgment vanished from his lips not body's death but body's banishment here from verona art thou banishèd be patient for the world is broad and wide o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince taking thy part hath rushed aside the law and turned that black word death to banishment this is dear mercy and thou seest it not thou fond mad man hear me a little speak i'll give thee armor to keep off that word adversity's sweet milk philosophy to comfort thee though thou art banishèd o then i see that madmen have no ears let me dispute with thee of thy estate arise one knocks good romeo hide thyself hark how they knock who's there romeo arise thou wilt be taken stay awhile stand up run to my study by and by god's will what simpleness is this i come i come who knocks so hard whence come you what's your will welcome then there on the ground with his own tears made drunk hold thy desperate hand art thou a man thy form cries out thou art thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast unseemly woman in a seeming man and ill beseeming beast in seeming both thou hast amazed me by my holy order i thought thy disposition better tempered hast thou slain tybalt wilt thou slay thyself and slay thy lady that in thy life lives by doing damnèd hate upon thyself why railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit which like a usurer abound'st in all and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit thy noble shape is but a form of wax digressing from the valor of a man thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish thy wit that ornament to shape and love misshapen in the conduct of them both like powder in a skilless soldier's flask is set afire by thine own ignorance and thou dismembered with thine own defense what rouse thee man thy juliet is alive for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead there art thou happy tybalt would kill thee but thou slewest tybalt there art thou happy the law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile there art thou happy a pack of blessings light upon thy back happiness courts thee in her best array but like a misbehaved and sullen wench thou pouts upon thy fortune and thy love take heed take heed for such die miserable go get thee to thy love as was decreed ascend her chamber hence and comfort her but look thou stay not till the watch be set for then

craves as desperate an execution as that is desperate which we would prevent if rather than to marry county paris thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself then is it likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame that cop'st with death himself to 'scape from it and if thou darest i'll give thee remedy hold then go home be merry give consent to marry paris wednesday is tomorrow tomorrow night look that thou lie alone let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber take thou this vial being then in bed and this distilling liquor drink thou off when presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humor for no pulse shall keep his native progress but surcease no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade to paly ashes thy eyes' windows fall like death when he shuts up the day of life each part deprived of supple government shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death and in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death thou shalt continue two and forty hours and then awake as from a pleasant sleep now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead then as the manner of our country is in thy best robes uncovered on the bier thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all the kindred of the capulets lie in the meantime against thou shalt awake shall romeo by my letters know our drift and hither shall he come and he and i will watch thy waking and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua and this shall free thee from this present shame if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear abate thy valor in the acting it hold get you gone be strong and prosperous in this resolve i'll send a friar with speed to mantua with my letters to thy lord come is the bride ready to go to church peace ho for shame confusion's cure lives not in these confusions heaven and yourself had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all and all the better is it for the maid your part in her you could not keep from death but heaven keeps his part in eternal life the most you sought was her promotion for 'twas your heaven she should be advanced and weep you now seeing she is advanced above the clouds as high as heaven itself o in this love you love your child so ill that you run mad seeing that she is well she's not well married that lives married long but she's best married that dies married young dry up your tears and stick your rosemary on this fair corse and as the custom is and in her best array bear her to church for though fond nature bids us all lament yet nature's tears are reason's merriment sir go you in and madam go with him and go sir paris everyone prepare to follow this fair corse unto her grave the heavens do lour upon you for some ill move them no more by crossing their high will this same should be the voice of friar john  welcome from mantua what says romeo or if his mind be writ give me his letter who bare my letter then to romeo unhappy fortune by my brotherhood the letter was not nice but full of charge of dear import and the neglecting it may do much danger friar john go hence get me an iron crow and bring it straight unto my cell now must i to the monument alone within this three hours will fair juliet wake she will beshrew me much that romeo hath had no notice of these accidents but i will write again to mantua and keep her at my cell till romeo come poor living corse closed in a dead man's tomb saint francis be my speed how oft tonight have my old feet stumbled at graves who's there bliss be upon you tell me good my friend what torch is yond that vainly lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls as i discern it burneth in the capels' monument who is it how long hath he been there go with me to the vault stay then i'll go alone fear comes upon me o much i fear some ill unthrifty thing romeo  alack alack what blood is this which stains the stony entrance of this sepulcher what mean these masterless and gory swords to lie discolored by this place of peace romeo o pale who else what paris too and steeped in blood ah what an unkind hour is guilty of this lamentable chance the lady stirs i hear some noise lady come from that nest of death contagion and unnatural sleep a greater power than we can contradict hath thwarted our intents come come away thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead and paris too come i'll dispose of thee among a sisterhood of holy nuns stay not to question for the watch is coming come go good juliet i dare no longer stay i am the greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murder and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemnèd and myself excused i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeo's faithful wife i married them and their stol'n marriage day was tybalt's doomsday whose untimely death banished the new made bridegroom from this city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined you to remove that siege of grief from her betrothed and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutored by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave being the time the potion's force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stayed by accident and yesternight returned my letter back then all alone at the prefixèd hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred's vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awakening here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificed some hour before his time unto the rigor of severest law
