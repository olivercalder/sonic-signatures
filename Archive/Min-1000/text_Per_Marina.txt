no i will rob tellus of her weed to strew thy green with flowers the yellows blues the purple violets and marigolds shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave while summer days doth last ay me poor maid born in a tempest when my mother died this world to me is as a lasting storm whirring me from my friends no i pray you i'll not bereave you of your servant well i will go but yet i have no desire to it my thanks sweet madam is this wind westerly that blows when i was born the wind was north my father as nurse says did never fear but cried good seamen to the sailors galling his kingly hands haling ropes and clasping to the mast endured a sea that almost burst the deck when i was born never was waves nor wind more violent and from the ladder tackle washes off a canvas climber ha says one wolt out and with a dropping industry they skip from stern to stern the boatswain whistles and the master calls and trebles their confusion what mean you why will you kill me why would she have me killed now as i can remember by my troth i never did her hurt in all my life i never spake bad word nor did ill turn to any living creature believe me la i never killed a mouse nor hurt a fly i trod upon a worm against my will but i wept for 't how have i offended wherein my death might yield her any profit or my life imply her any danger you will not do 't for all the world i hope you are well favored and your looks foreshow you have a gentle heart i saw you lately when you caught hurt in parting two that fought good sooth it showed well in you do so now your lady seeks my life come you between and save poor me the weaker alack that leonine was so slack so slow he should have struck not spoke or that these pirates not enough barbarous had but o'erboard thrown me for to seek my mother that i am pretty i accuse them not the more my fault to 'scape his hands where i was to die no are you a woman an honest woman or not a woman the gods defend me i understand you not if fires be hot knives sharp or waters deep untied i still my virgin knot will keep diana aid my purpose i desire to find him so that i may worthily note him if he govern the country you are bound to him indeed but how honorable he is in that i know not what he will do graciously i will thankfully receive what trade sir i cannot be offended with my trade please you to name it e'er since i can remember earlier too sir if now i be one do you know this house to be a place of such resort and will come into 't i hear say you're of honorable parts and are the governor of this place who is my principal if you were born to honor show it now if put upon you make the judgment good that thought you worthy of it for me that am a maid though most ungentle fortune have placed me in this sty where since i came diseases have been sold dearer than physic  that the gods would set me free from this unhallowed place though they did change me to the meanest bird that flies i' the purer air the good gods preserve you whither would you have me hark hark you gods whither wilt thou have me prithee tell me one thing first what canst thou wish thine enemy to be neither of these are so bad as thou art since they do better thee in their command thou hold'st a place for which the pained'st fiend of hell would not in reputation change thou art the damn√®d doorkeeper to every coistrel that comes enquiring for his tib to the choleric fisting of every rogue thy ear is liable thy food is such as hath been belched on by infected lungs do anything but this thou dost empty old receptacles or common shores of filth serve by indenture to the common hangman any of these ways are yet better than this for what thou professest a baboon could he speak would own a name too dear that the gods would safely deliver me from this place here here's gold for thee if that thy master would gain by me proclaim that i can sing weave sew and dance with other virtues which i'll keep from boast and will undertake all these to teach i doubt not but this populous city will yield many scholars prove that i cannot take me home again and prostitute me to the basest groom that doth frequent your house but amongst honest women sir i will use my utmost skill in his recovery provided that none but i and my companion maid be suffered to come near him no nor looked on us hail sir my lord lend ear i am a maid my lord that ne'er before invited eyes but have been gazed on like a comet she speaks my lord that may be hath endured a grief might equal yours if both were justly weighed though wayward fortune did malign my state my derivation was from ancestors who stood equivalent with mighty kings but time hath rooted out my parentage and to the world and awkward casualties bound me in servitude i will desist but there is something glows upon my cheek and whispers in mine ear go not till he speak i said my lord if you did know my parentage you would not do me violence no nor of any shores yet i was mortally brought forth and am no other than i appear where i am but a stranger from the deck you may discern the place if i should tell my history it would seem like lies disdained in the reporting so indeed i did some such thing i said and said no more but what my thoughts did warrant me was likely my name is marina patience good sir or here i'll cease the name was given me by one that had some power  my father and a king you said you would believe me but not to be a troubler of your peace i will end here called marina for i was born at sea my mother was the daughter of a king who died the minute i was born as my good nurse lychorida hath oft delivered weeping you scorn believe me 'twere best i did give o'er the king my father did in tarsus leave me till cruel cleon with his wicked wife did seek to murder me and having wooed a villain to attempt it who having drawn to do 't a crew of pirates came and rescued me brought me to mytilene but good sir whither will you have me why do you weep it may be you think me an impostor no good faith i am the daughter to king pericles if good king pericles be first sir i pray what is your title is it no more to be your daughter than to say my mother's name was thaisa thaisa was my mother who did end the minute i began my heart leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom
