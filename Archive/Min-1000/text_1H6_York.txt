great lords and gentlemen what means this silence dare no man answer in a case of truth then say at once if i maintained the truth or else was wrangling somerset in th' error tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance the truth appears so naked on my side that any purblind eye may find it out since you are tongue tied and so loath to speak in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts let him that is a trueborn gentleman and stands upon the honor of his birth if he suppose that i have pleaded truth from off this brier pluck a white rose with me and i now somerset where is your argument meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses for pale they look with fear as witnessing the truth on our side hath not thy rose a canker somerset ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood now by this maiden blossom in my hand i scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy proud pole i will and scorn both him and thee he bears him on the place's privilege or durst not for his craven heart say thus my father was attachèd not attainted condemned to die for treason but no traitor and that i'll prove on better men than somerset were growing time once ripened to my will for your partaker pole and you yourself i'll note you in my book of memory to scourge you for this apprehension look to it well and say you are well warned and by my soul this pale and angry rose as cognizance of my blood drinking hate will i forever and my faction wear until it wither with me to my grave or flourish to the height of my degree how i am braved and must perforce endure it good master vernon i am bound to you that you on my behalf would pluck a flower thanks gentle sir come let us four to dinner i dare say this quarrel will drink blood another day ay noble uncle thus ignobly used your nephew late despisèd richard comes first lean thine agèd back against mine arm and in that ease i'll tell thee my disease this day in argument upon a case some words there grew 'twixt somerset and me among which terms he used his lavish tongue and did upbraid me with my father's death which obloquy set bars before my tongue else with the like i had requited him therefore good uncle for my father's sake in honor of a true plantagenet and for alliance' sake declare the cause my father earl of cambridge lost his head discover more at large what cause that was for i am ignorant and cannot guess of which my lord your honor is the last thy grave admonishments prevail with me but yet methinks my father's execution was nothing less than bloody tyranny o uncle would some part of my young years might but redeem the passage of your age and peace no war befall thy parting soul in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage and like a hermit overpassed thy days  well i will lock his counsel in my breast and what i do imagine let that rest  keepers convey him hence and i myself will see his burial better than his life here dies the dusky torch of mortimer choked with ambition of the meaner sort and for those wrongs those bitter injuries which somerset hath offered to my house i doubt not but with honor to redress and therefore haste i to the parliament either to be restorèd to my blood or make mine ill th' advantage of my good plantagenet i see must hold his tongue lest it be said speak sirrah when you should must your bold verdict enter talk with lords else would i have a fling at winchester thy humble servant vows obedience and humble service till the point of death and so thrive richard as thy foes may fall and as my duty springs so perish they that grudge one thought against your majesty this is my servant hear him noble prince will not this malice somerset be left let this dissension first be tried by fight and then your highness shall command a peace there is my pledge accept it somerset and so he did but yet i like it not in that he wears the badge of somerset and if iwis he did but let it rest other affairs must now be managèd are not the speedy scouts returned again that dogged the mighty army of the dauphin a plague upon that villain somerset that thus delays my promisèd supply of horsemen that were levied for this siege renownèd talbot doth expect my aid and i am louted by a traitor villain and cannot help the noble chevalier god comfort him in this necessity if he miscarry farewell wars in france o god that somerset who in proud heart doth stop my cornets were in talbot's place so should we save a valiant gentleman by forfeiting a traitor and a coward mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep that thus we die while remiss traitors sleep he dies we lose i break my warlike word we mourn france smiles we lose they daily get all long of this vile traitor somerset alas what joy shall noble talbot have to bid his young son welcome to his grave away vexation almost stops my breath that sundered friends greet in the hour of death lucy farewell no more my fortune can but curse the cause i cannot aid the man maine blois poictiers and tours are won away long all of somerset and his delay damsel of france i think i have you fast unchain your spirits now with spelling charms and try if they can gain your liberty a goodly prize fit for the devil's grace see how the ugly witch doth bend her brows as if with circe she would change my shape o charles the dauphin is a proper man no shape but his can please your dainty eye fell banning hag enchantress hold thy tongue curse miscreant when thou com'st to the stake bring forth that sorceress condemned to burn this argues what her kind of life hath been wicked and vile and so her death concludes take her away for she hath lived too long to fill the world with vicious qualities ay ay away with her to execution now heaven forfend the holy maid with child she and the dauphin have been juggling i did imagine what would be her refuge alanson that notorious machiavel it dies an if it had a thousand lives why here's a girl i think she knows not well  there

foul accursèd minister of hell is all our travail turned to this effect after the slaughter of so many peers so many captains gentlemen and soldiers that in this quarrel have been overthrown and sold their bodies for their country's benefit shall we at last conclude effeminate peace have we not lost most part of all the towns  by treason falsehood and by treachery  our great progenitors had conquerèd o warwick warwick i foresee with grief the utter loss of all the realm of france speak winchester for boiling choler chokes the hollow passage of my poisoned voice by sight of these our baleful enemies insulting charles hast thou by secret means used intercession to obtain a league and now the matter grows to compromise stand'st thou aloof upon comparison either accept the title thou usurp'st of benefit proceeding from our king and not of any challenge of desert or we will plague thee with incessant wars then swear allegiance to his majesty as thou art knight never to disobey nor be rebellious to the crown of england thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england so now dismiss your army when you please hang up your ensigns let your drums be still for here we entertain a solemn peace
