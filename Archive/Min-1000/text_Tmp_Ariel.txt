all hail great master grave sir hail i come to answer thy best pleasure be 't to fly to swim to dive into the fire to ride on the curled clouds to thy strong bidding task ariel and all his quality to every article i boarded the king's ship now on the beak now in the waist the deck in every cabin i flamed amazement sometimes i'd divide and burn in many places on the topmast the yards and bowsprit would i flame distinctly then meet and join jove's lightning the precursors o' th' dreadful thunderclaps more momentary and sight outrunning were not the fire and cracks of sulfurous roaring the most mighty neptune seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble yea his dread trident shake not a soul but felt a fever of the mad and played some tricks of desperation all but mariners plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel then all afire with me the king's son ferdinand with hair up staring then like reeds not hair  was the first man that leaped cried hell is empty and all the devils are here close by my master not a hair perished on their sustaining garments not a blemish but fresher than before and as thou bad'st me in troops i have dispersed them 'bout the isle the king's son have i landed by himself whom i left cooling of the air with sighs in an odd angle of the isle and sitting his arms in this sad knot safely in harbor is the king's ship in the deep nook where once thou called'st me up at midnight to fetch dew from the still vexed bermoothes there she's hid the mariners all under hatches stowed who with a charm joined to their suffered labor i have left asleep and for the rest o' th' fleet which i dispersed they all have met again and are upon the mediterranean float bound sadly home for naples supposing that they saw the king's ship wracked and his great person perish past the mid season is there more toil since thou dost give me pains let me remember thee what thou hast promised which is not yet performed me my liberty i prithee remember i have done thee worthy service told thee no lies made no mistakings served without or grudge or grumblings thou did promise to bate me a full year no i do not sir no sir sir in argier ay sir yes caliban her son i thank thee master pardon master i will be correspondent to command and do my spriting gently that's my noble master what shall i do say what what shall i do my lord it shall be done come unto these yellow sands and then take hands curtsied when you have and kissed the wild waves whist foot it featly here and there and sweet sprites bear the burden hark hark bow wow the watchdogs bark bow wow hark hark i hear the strain of strutting chanticleer cry cock a diddle dow full fathom five thy father lies of his bones are coral made those are pearls that were his eyes nothing of him that doth fade but doth suffer a sea change into something rich and strange sea nymphs hourly ring his knell ding dong hark now i hear them ding dong bell to th' syllable my master through his art foresees the danger that you his friend are in and sends me forth  for else his project dies to keep them living while you here do snoring lie open eyed conspiracy his time doth take if of life you keep a care shake off slumber and beware awake awake prospero my lord shall know what i have done so king go safely on to seek thy son thou liest thou liest thou canst not thou liest this will i tell my master you are three men of sin whom destiny that hath to instrument this lower world and what is in 't the never surfeited sea hath caused to belch up you and on this island where man doth not inhabit you 'mongst men being most unfit to live i have made you mad and even with such like valor men hang and drown their proper selves you fools i and my fellows are ministers of fate the elements of whom your swords are tempered may as well wound the loud winds or with bemocked at stabs kill the still closing waters as diminish one dowl that's in my plume my fellow ministers are like invulnerable if you could hurt your swords are now too massy for your strengths and will not be uplifted but remember  for that's my business to you that you three from milan did supplant good prospero exposed unto the sea which hath requit it him and his innocent child for which foul deed the powers delaying not forgetting have incensed the seas and shores yea all the creatures against your peace thee of thy son alonso they have bereft and do pronounce by me ling'ring perdition worse than any death can be at once shall step by step attend you and your ways whose wraths to guard you from  which here in this most desolate isle else falls upon your heads is nothing but heart's sorrow and a clear life ensuing what would my potent master here i am presently before you can say come and go and breathe twice and cry so so each one tripping on his toe will be here with mop and mow do you love me master no well i conceive thy thoughts i cleave to what's thy pleasure ay my commander when i presented ceres i thought to have told thee of it but i feared lest i might anger thee i told you sir they were red hot with drinking so full of valor that they smote the air for breathing in their faces beat the ground for kissing of their feet yet always bending towards their project then i beat my tabor at which like unbacked colts they pricked their ears advanced their eyelids lifted up their noses as they smelt music so i charmed their ears that calf like they my lowing followed through toothed briers sharp furzes pricking gorse and thorns which entered their frail shins at last i left them i' th' filthy mantled pool beyond your cell there dancing up to th' chins that the foul lake o'erstunk their feet i go i go silver there it goes silver hark they roar on the sixth hour at which time my lord you said our work should cease confined together in the same fashion as you gave in charge just as you left them all prisoners sir in the line grove which weather fends your cell they cannot budge till your release the king his brother and yours abide all three distracted and the remainder mourning over them brimful of sorrow and dismay but chiefly him that you termed sir the good old lord gonzalo his tears runs down his beard like winter's drops from eaves of reeds your charm so strongly works 'em that if you now beheld them your affections would become tender mine would sir were i human i'll fetch them sir where the bee sucks there suck i in a cowslip's bell i lie there i couch when owls do cry on the bat's back i do fly after summer merrily merrily merrily shall i live now under the blossom that hangs on the bow i drink the air before me and return or ere your pulse twice beat sir all this service have i done since i went was 't well done
