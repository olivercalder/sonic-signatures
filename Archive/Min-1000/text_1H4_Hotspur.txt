my liege i did deny no prisoners but i remember when the fight was done when i was dry with rage and extreme toil breathless and faint leaning upon my sword came there a certain lord neat and trimly dressed fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reaped showed like a stubble land at harvest home he was perfumèd like a milliner and 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held a pouncet box which ever and anon he gave his nose and took 't away again who therewith angry when it next came there took it in snuff and still he smiled and talked and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by he called them untaught knaves unmannerly to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility with many holiday and lady terms he questioned me amongst the rest demanded my prisoners in your majesty's behalf i then all smarting with my wounds being cold to be so pestered with a popinjay out of my grief and my impatience answered neglectingly i know not what  he should or he should not for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a waiting gentlewoman of guns and drums and wounds god save the mark  and telling me the sovereignest thing on earth was parmacety for an inward bruise and that it was great pity so it was this villainous saltpeter should be digged out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroyed so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier this bald unjointed chat of his my lord i answered indirectly as i said and i beseech you let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty revolted mortimer he never did fall off my sovereign liege but by the chance of war to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds those mouthèd wounds which valiantly he took when on the gentle severn's sedgy bank in single opposition hand to hand he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severn's flood who then affrighted with their bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank blood stainèd with these valiant combatants never did bare and rotten policy color her working with such deadly wounds nor never could the noble mortimer receive so many and all willingly then let not him be slandered with revolt an if the devil come and roar for them i will not send them i will after straight and tell him so for i will ease my heart albeit i make a hazard of my head speak of mortimer zounds i will speak of him and let my soul want mercy if i do not join with him yea on his part i'll empty all these veins and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust but i will lift the downtrod mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king as this ingrate and cankered bolingbroke he will forsooth have all my prisoners and when i urged the ransom once again of my wife's brother then his cheek looked pale and on my face he turned an eye of death trembling even at the name of mortimer but soft i pray you did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown nay then i cannot blame his cousin king that wished him on the barren mountains starve but shall it be that you that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornation shall it be that you a world of curses undergo being the agents or base second means the cords the ladder or the hangman rather o pardon me that i descend so low to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtle king shall it for shame be spoken in these days or fill up chronicles in time to come that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf as both of you god pardon it have done to put down richard that sweet lovely rose and plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke and shall it in more shame be further spoken that you are fooled discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames you underwent no yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banished honors and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again revenge the jeering and disdained contempt of this proud king who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore i say  if he fall in good night or sink or swim send danger from the east unto the west so honor cross it from the north to south and let them grapple o the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honor from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line could never touch the ground and pluck up drownèd honor by the locks so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival all her dignities but out upon this half faced fellowship i cry you mercy i'll keep them all by god he shall not have a scot of them no if a scot would save his soul he shall not i'll keep them by this hand nay i will that's flat he said he would not ransom mortimer forbade my tongue to speak of mortimer but i will find him when he lies asleep and in his ear i'll hollo mortimer nay i'll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but mortimer and give it him to keep his anger still in motion all studies here i solemnly defy save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same sword and buckler prince of wales  but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance  i would have him poisoned with a pot of ale why look you i am whipped and scourged with rods nettled and stung with pismires when i hear of this vile politician bolingbroke in richard's time what do you call the place a plague upon it it is in gloucestershire 'twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept his uncle york where i first bowed my knee unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke 'sblood when you and he came back from ravenspurgh you say true why what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me look when his infant fortune came to age and gentle harry percy and kind cousin o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me good uncle tell your tale i have done i have done i' faith of york is it not i smell it upon my life it will do well why it cannot choose but be a noble plot and then the power of scotland and of york to join with mortimer ha in faith it is exceedingly well aimed he does he does we'll be revenged on him uncle adieu o let the hours be short till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport but for mine own part my lord i could be well contented to be there in respect of the love i bear your house he could be contented why is he not then in respect of the love he bears our house he shows in this he loves his own barn better than he loves our house let me see some more the purpose you undertake is dangerous why that's certain 'tis dangerous to take a cold to sleep to drink but i tell you my lord fool out of this nettle danger we pluck this flower safety the purpose you undertake is dangerous the friends you have named uncertain the time itself unsorted and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition say you so say you so i say unto you again you are a shallow cowardly hind and you lie what a lack brain is this by the lord our plot is a good plot as ever was laid our friends true and constant a good plot good friends and full of expectation an excellent plot very good friends what a frosty spirited rogue is this why my lord of york commends the plot and the general course of the action zounds an i were now by this rascal i

meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month and are they not some of them set forward already what a pagan rascal is this an infidel ha you shall see now in very sincerity of fear and cold heart

prepared i will set forward tonight how now kate i must leave you within these two hours what ho is gilliams with the packet gone hath butler brought those horses from the sheriff what horse a roan a

worcester  a plague upon it i have forgot the map and you in hell as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of why so it would have done at the same season if your mother's cat had but kittened though yourself had never been born and i say the earth was not of my mind if you suppose as fearing you it shook o then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire and not in fear of your nativity diseasèd nature oftentimes breaks forth in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth is with a kind of colic pinched and vexed by the imprisoning of unruly wind within her womb which for enlargement striving shakes the old beldam earth and topples down steeples and moss grown towers at your birth our grandam earth having this distemp'rature in passion shook i think there's no man speaks better welsh i'll to dinner why so can i or so can any man but will they come when you do call for them and i can teach thee coz to shame the devil by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil if thou have power to raise him bring him hither and i'll be sworn i have power to shame him hence o while you live tell truth and shame the devil home without boots and in foul weather too how 'scapes he agues in the devil's name methinks my moiety north from burton here in quantity equals not one of yours see how this river comes me cranking in and cuts me from the best of all my land a huge half moon a monstrous cantle out i'll have the current in this place dammed up and here the smug and silver trent shall run in a new channel fair and evenly it shall not wind with such a deep indent to rob me of so rich a bottom here i'll have it so a little charge will do it will not you who shall say me nay let me not understand you then speak it in welsh marry and i am glad of it with all my heart i had rather be a kitten and cry mew than one of these same meter balladmongers i had rather hear a brazen can'stick turned or a dry wheel grate on the axletree and that would set my teeth nothing an edge nothing so much as mincing poetry 'tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag i do not care i'll give thrice so much land to any well deserving friend but in the way of bargain mark you me i'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair are the indentures drawn shall we be gone i cannot choose sometime he angers me with telling me of the moldwarp and the ant of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies and of a dragon and a finless fish a clip winged griffin and a moulten raven a couching lion and a ramping cat and such a deal of skimble skamble stuff as puts me from my faith i tell you what  he held me last night at least nine hours in reckoning up the several devils' names that were his lackeys i cried hum and well go to but marked him not a word o he is as tedious as a tired horse a railing wife worse than a smoky house i had rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill far than feed on cates and have him talk to me in any summer house in christendom well i am schooled good manners be your speed here come our wives and let us take our leave come kate thou art perfect in lying down come quick quick that i may lay my head in thy lap now i perceive the devil understands welsh and 'tis no marvel he is so humorous by 'r lady he is a good musician i had rather hear lady my brach howl in irish no neither 'tis a woman's fault to the welsh lady's bed peace she sings come kate i'll have your song too not yours in good sooth heart you swear like a comfit maker's wife not you in good sooth and as true as i live and as god shall mend me and as sure as day  and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths as if thou never walk'st further than finsbury swear me kate like a lady as thou art a good mouth filling oath and leave in sooth and such protest of pepper gingerbread to velvet guards and sunday citizens come sing 'tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast teacher an the indentures be drawn i'll away within these two hours and so come in when you will well said my noble scot if speaking truth in this fine age were not thought flattery such attribution should the douglas have as not a soldier of this season's stamp should go so general current through the world by god i cannot flatter i do defy the tongues of soothers but a braver place in my heart's love hath no man than yourself nay task me to my word approve me lord do so and 'tis well what letters hast thou there i can but thank you letters from him why comes he not himself zounds how has he the leisure to be sick in such a justling time who leads his power under whose government come they along sick now droop now this sickness doth infect the very lifeblood of our enterprise 'tis catching hither even to our camp he writes me here that inward sickness  and that his friends by deputation could not so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet to lay so dangerous and dear a trust on any soul removed but on his own yet doth he give us bold advertisement that with our small conjunction we should on to see how fortune is disposed to us for as he writes there is no quailing now because the king is certainly possessed of all our purposes what say you to it a perilous gash a very limb lopped off and yet in faith it is not his present want seems more than we shall find it were it good to set the exact wealth of all our states all at one cast to set so rich a main on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour it were not good for therein should we read the very bottom and the soul of hope the very list the very utmost bound of all our fortunes a rendezvous a home to fly unto if that the devil and mischance look big upon the maidenhead of our affairs you strain too far i rather of his absence make this use it lends a luster and more great opinion a larger dare to our great enterprise than if the earl were here for men must think if we without his help can make a head to push against a kingdom with his help we shall o'erturn it topsy turvy down yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole my cousin vernon welcome by my soul no harm what more he shall be welcome too where is his son the nimble footed madcap prince of wales and his comrades that daffed the world aside and bid it pass no more no more worse than the sun in march this praise doth nourish agues let them come they come like sacrifices in their trim and to the fire eyed maid of smoky war all hot and bleeding will we offer them the mailèd mars shall on his altar sit up to the ears in blood i am on fire to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh and yet not ours come let me taste my horse who is to bear me like a thunderbolt against the bosom of the prince of wales harry to harry shall hot horse to horse meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse o that glendower were come what may the king's whole battle reach unto forty let it be my father and glendower being both away the powers of us may serve so great a day come let us take a muster speedily doomsday is near die all die merrily we'll fight with him tonight why say you so looks he not for supply his is certain ours is doubtful tonight say i so are the horses of the enemy in general journey bated and brought low the better part of ours are full of rest welcome sir walter blunt and would to god you were of our determination some of us love you well and even those some envy your great deservings and good name because you are not of our quality but stand against us like an enemy the king is kind and well we know the king knows at what time to promise when to pay my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears and when he was not six and twenty strong sick in the world's regard wretched and low a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home my father gave him welcome to the shore and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster to sue his livery and beg his peace with tears of innocency and terms of zeal my father in kind heart and pity moved swore him assistance and performed it too now when the lords and barons of the realm perceived northumberland did lean to him the more and less came in with cap and knee met him in boroughs cities villages attended him on bridges stood in lanes laid gifts before him proffered him their oaths gave him their heirs as pages followed him even at the heels in golden multitudes he presently as greatness knows itself steps me a little higher than his vow made to my father while his blood was poor upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh and now forsooth takes on him to reform some certain edicts and some strait decrees that lie too heavy on the commonwealth cries out upon abuses seems to weep over his country's wrongs and by this face this seeming brow of justice did he win the hearts of all that he did angle for proceeded further cut me off the heads of all the favorites that the absent king in deputation left behind him here when he was personal in the irish war then to the point in short time after he deposed the king soon after that deprived him of his life and in the neck of that tasked the whole state to make that worse suffered his kinsman march who is if every owner were well placed indeed his king to be engaged in wales there without ransom to lie forfeited disgraced me in my happy victories sought to entrap me by intelligence rated mine uncle from the council board in rage dismissed my father from the court broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong and in conclusion drove us to seek out this head of safety and withal to pry into his title the which we find too indirect for long continuance not so sir walter we'll withdraw awhile go to the king and let there be impawned some surety for a safe return again and in the morning early shall mine uncle bring him our purposes and so farewell and maybe so we shall my uncle is returned deliver up my lord of westmoreland  uncle what news lord douglas go you and tell him so did you beg any god forbid o would the quarrel lay upon our heads and that no man might draw short breath today but i and harry monmouth tell me tell me how showed his tasking seemed it in contempt cousin i think thou art enamorèd on his follies never did i hear of any prince so wild a liberty but be he as he will yet once ere night i will embrace him with a soldier's arm that he shall shrink under my courtesy  arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends better consider what you have to do than i that have not well the gift of tongue can lift your blood up with persuasion i cannot read them now  o gentlemen the time of life is short to spend that shortness basely were too long if life did ride upon a dial's point still ending at the arrival of an hour an if we live we live to tread on kings if die brave death when princes die with us now for our consciences the arms are fair when the intent of bearing them is just i thank him that he cuts me from my tale for i profess not talking only this let each man do his best and here draw i a sword whose temper i intend to stain with the best blood that i can meet withal in the adventure of this perilous day now esperance percy and set on sound all the lofty instruments of war and by that music let us all embrace for heaven to earth some of us never shall a second time do such a courtesy o douglas hadst thou fought at holmedon thus i never had triumphed upon a scot where this douglas no i know this face full well a gallant knight he was his name was blunt semblably furnished like the king himself the king hath many marching in his coats up and away our soldiers stand full fairly for the day if i mistake not thou art harry monmouth my name is harry percy nor shall it harry for the hour is come to end the one of us and would to god thy name in arms were now as great as mine i can no longer brook thy vanities o harry thou hast robbed me of my youth i better brook the loss of brittle life than those proud titles thou hast won of me they wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh but thoughts the slaves of life and life time's fool and time that takes survey of all the world must have a stop o i could prophesy but that the earthy and cold hand of death lies on my tongue no percy thou art dust and food for
