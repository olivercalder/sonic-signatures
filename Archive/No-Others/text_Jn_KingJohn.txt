not this thou dost forget thyself what earthy name to interrogatories can task the free breath of a sacred king thou canst not cardinal devise a name so slight unworthy and ridiculous to charge me to an answer as the pope tell him this tale and from the mouth of england add thus much more that no italian priest shall tithe or toll in our dominions but as we under god are supreme head so under him that great supremacy where we do reign we will alone uphold without th' assistance of a mortal hand so tell the pope all reverence set apart to him and his usurped authority though you and all the kings of christendom are led so grossly by this meddling priest dreading the curse that money may buy out and by the merit of vile gold dross dust purchase corrupted pardon of a man who in that sale sells pardon from himself though you and all the rest so grossly led this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish yet i alone alone do me oppose against the pope and count his friends my foes philip what sayst thou to the cardinal the king is moved and answers not to this france thou shalt rue this hour within this hour cousin go draw our puissance together france i am burned up with inflaming

be to thee as thy father was cousin away for england haste before and ere our coining see thou shake the bags of hoarding abbots imprisoned angels set at liberty the fat ribs of peace must by the hungry now be fed upon use our commission in his utmost force coz farewell come hither hubert o my gentle hubert we owe thee much within this wall of flesh there is a soul counts thee her creditor and with advantage means to pay thy love and my good friend thy voluntary oath lives in this bosom dearly cherishèd give me thy hand i had a thing to say but i will fit it with some better tune by heaven hubert i am almost ashamed to say what good respect i have of thee good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet but thou shalt have and creep time ne'er so slow yet it shall come for me to do thee good i had a thing to say but let it go the sun is in the heaven and the proud day attended with the pleasures of the world is all too wanton and too full of gauds to give me audience if the midnight bell did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth sound on into the drowsy race of night if this same were a churchyard where we stand and thou possessèd with a thousand wrongs or if that surly spirit melancholy had baked thy blood and made it heavy thick which else runs tickling up and down the veins making that idiot laughter keep men's eyes and strain their cheeks to idle merriment a passion hateful to my purposes or if that thou couldst see me without eyes hear me without thine ears and make reply without a tongue using conceit alone without eyes ears and harmful sound of words then in despite of brooded watchful day i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts but ah i will not yet i love thee well and by my troth i think thou lov'st me well do not i know thou wouldst good hubert hubert hubert throw thine eye on yon young boy i'll tell thee what my friend he is a very serpent in my way and wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread he lies before me dost thou understand me thou art his keeper death a grave enough i could be merry now hubert i love thee well i'll not say what i intend for thee remember madam fare you well i'll send those powers o'er to your majesty for england cousin go hubert shall be your man attend on you with all true duty on toward calais ho here once again we sit once again crowned and looked upon i hope with cheerful eyes some reasons of this double coronation i have possessed you with and think them strong and more more strong when lesser is my fear i shall endue you with meantime but ask what you would have reformed that is not well and well shall you perceive how willingly i will both hear and grant you your requests let it be so i do commit his youth to your direction hubert what news with you we cannot hold mortality's strong hand  good lords although my will to give is living the suit which you demand is gone and dead he tells us arthur is deceased tonight why do you bend such solemn brows on me think you i bear the shears of destiny have i commandment on the pulse of life they burn in indignation i repent there is no sure foundation set on blood no certain life achieved by others' death a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks so foul a sky clears not without a storm pour down thy weather how goes all in france o where hath our intelligence been drunk where hath it slept where is my mother's care that such an army could be drawn in france and she not hear of it withhold thy speed dreadful occasion o make a league with me till i have pleased my discontented peers what mother dead how wildly then walks my estate in france  under whose conduct came those powers of france that thou for truth giv'st out are landed here thou hast made me giddy with these ill tidings now what says the world to your proceedings do not seek to stuff my head with more ill news for it is full bear with me cousin for i was amazed under the tide but now i breathe again aloft the flood and can give audience to any tongue speak it of what it will thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so hubert away with him imprison him and on that day at noon whereon he says i shall yield up my crown let him be hanged deliver him to safety and return for i must use thee o my gentle cousin hear'st thou the news abroad who are arrived gentle kinsman go and thrust thyself into their companies i have a way to win their loves again bring them before me nay but make haste the better foot before o let me have no subject enemies when adverse foreigners affright my towns with dreadful pomp of stout invasion be mercury set feathers to thy heels and fly like thought from them to me again spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman go after him for he perhaps shall need some messenger betwixt me and the peers and be thou he my mother dead five moons why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears why urgest thou so oft young arthur's death thy hand hath murdered him i had a mighty cause to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him it is the curse of kings to be attended by slaves that take their humors for a warrant to break within the bloody house of life and on the winking of authority to understand a law to know the meaning of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns more upon humor than advised respect o when the last accompt twixt heaven and earth is to be made then shall this hand and seal witness against us to damnation how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by a fellow by the hand of nature marked quoted and signed to do a deed of shame this murder had not come into my mind but taking note of thy abhorred aspect finding thee fit for bloody villainy apt liable to be employed in danger i faintly broke with thee of arthur's death and thou to be endearèd to a king made it no conscience to destroy a prince hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause when i spake darkly what i purposèd or turned an eye of doubt upon my face as bid me tell my tale in express words deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me but thou didst understand me by my signs and didst in signs again parley with sin yea without stop didst let thy heart consent and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed which both our tongues held vile to name out of my sight and never see me more my nobles leave me and my state is braved even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers nay in the body of this fleshly land this kingdom this confine of blood and breath hostility and civil tumult reigns between my conscience and my cousin's death doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers throw this report on their incensèd rage and make them tame to their obedience forgive the comment that my passion made upon thy feature for my rage was blind and foul imaginary eyes of blood presented thee more hideous than thou art o answer not but to my closet bring the angry lords with all expedient haste i conjure thee but slowly run more fast thus have i yielded up into your hand the circle of my glory now keep your holy word go meet the french and from his holiness use all your power to stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed our discontented counties do revolt our people quarrel with obedience swearing allegiance and the love of soul to stranger blood to foreign royalty this inundation of mistempered humor rests by you only to be qualified then pause not for the present time's so sick that present med'cine must be ministered or overthrow incurable ensues is this ascension day did not the prophet say that before ascension day at noon my crown i should give off even so i have i did suppose it should be on constraint but god be thanked it is but voluntary would not my lords return to me again after they heard young arthur was alive that villain hubert told me he did live the legate of the pope hath been with me and i have made a happy peace with him and he hath promised to dismiss the powers led by the dauphin have thou the ordering of this present time how goes the day with us o tell me hubert this fever that hath troubled me so long lies heavy on me o my heart is sick tell him toward swinstead to the abbey there ay me this tyrant fever burns me up and will not let me welcome this good news set on toward swinstead to my litter straight weakness possesseth me and i am faint ay marry now my soul hath elbow room it would not out at windows nor at doors there is so hot a summer in my bosom that all my bowels crumble up to dust i am a scribbled form drawn with a pen upon a parchment and against this fire do i shrink up poisoned ill fare dead forsook cast off and none of you will bid the winter come to thrust his icy fingers in my maw nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course through my burned bosom nor entreat the north to make his bleak winds kiss my parchèd lips and comfort me with cold i do not ask you much i beg cold comfort and you are so strait and so ingrateful you deny me that the salt in them is hot within me is a hell and there the poison is as a fiend confined to tyrannize on unreprievable condemnèd blood o cousin thou art come to set mine eye the tackle of my heart is cracked and burnt and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail are turnèd to one thread one little hair my heart hath one poor string to stay it by which holds but till thy news be utterèd and then all this thou seest is but a clod and module of confounded royalty
