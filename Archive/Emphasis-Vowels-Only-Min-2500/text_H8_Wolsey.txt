the duke of buckingham's surveyor ha where's his examination is he in person ready well we shall then know more and buckingham shall lessen this big look please you sir i know but of a single part in aught pertains to th' state and front but in that file where others tell steps with me and for me i have no further gone in this than by a single voice and that not passed me but by learnèd approbation of the judges if i am traduced by ignorant tongues which neither know my faculties nor person yet will be the chronicles of my doing let me say 'tis but the fate of place and the rough brake that virtue must go through we must not stint our necessary actions in the fear to cope malicious censurers which ever as ravenous fishes do a vessel follow that is new trimmed but benefit no further than vainly longing what we oft do best by sick interpreters once weak ones is not ours or not allowed what worst as oft hitting a grosser quality is cried up for our best act if we shall stand still in fear our motion will be mocked or carped at we should take root here where we sit or sit state statues only a word with you let there be letters writ to every shire of the king's grace and pardon the grievèd commons hardly conceive of me let it be noised that through our intercession this revokement and pardon comes i shall anon advise you further in the proceeding stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you most like a careful subject have collected out of the duke of buckingham please your highness note this dangerous conception in this point not friended by his wish to

lovell is the banquet ready i' th' privy chamber your grace i fear with dancing is a little heated there's fresher air my lord in the next chamber sir you cannot i would your grace would give us but an hour of private conference your grace has given a precedent of wisdom above all princes in committing freely your scruple to the voice of christendom who can be angry now what envy reach you the spaniard tied by blood and favor to her must now confess if they have any goodness the trial just and noble all the clerks  i mean the learnèd ones in christian kingdoms  have their free voices rome the nurse of judgment invited by your noble self hath sent one general tongue unto us this good man this just and learnèd priest cardinal campeius whom once more i present unto your highness i know your majesty has always loved her so dear in heart not to deny her that a woman of less place might ask by law scholars allowed freely to argue for her give me your hand much joy and favor to you you are the king's now yes he was yes surely how of me heav'n's peace be with him that's christian care enough for living murmurers there's places of rebuke he was a fool for he would needs be virtuous that good fellow if i command him follows my appointment i will have none so near else learn this brother we live not to be griped by meaner persons whilst our commission from rome is read let silence be commanded be 't so proceed you have here lady and of your choice these reverend fathers men of singular integrity and learning yea the elect o' th' land who are assembled to plead your cause it shall be therefore bootless that longer you desire the court as well for your own quiet as to rectify what is unsettled in the king your pleasure madam be patient yet i do profess you speak not like yourself who ever yet have stood to charity and displayed th' effects of disposition gentle and of wisdom o'ertopping woman's power madam you do me wrong i have no spleen against you nor injustice for you or any how far i have proceeded or how far further shall is warranted by a commission from the consistory yea the whole consistory of rome you charge me that i have blown this coal i do deny it the king is present if it be known to him that i gainsay my deed how may he wound and worthily my falsehood yea as much as you have done my truth if he know that i am free of your report he knows i am not of your wrong therefore in him it lies to cure me and the cure is to remove these thoughts from you the which before his highness shall speak in i do beseech you gracious madam to unthink your speaking and to say so no more most gracious sir in humblest manner i require your highness that it shall please you to declare in hearing of all these ears for where i am robbed and bound there must i be unloosed although not there at once and fully satisfied whether ever i did broach this business to your highness or laid any scruple in your way which might induce you to the question on 't or ever have to you but with thanks to god for such a royal lady spake one the least word that might be to the prejudice of her present state or touch of her good person peace to your highness may it please you noble madam to withdraw into your private chamber we shall give you the full cause of our coming tanta est erga te mentis integritas regina serenissima  noble lady i am sorry my integrity should breed  and service to his majesty and you  so deep suspicion where all faith was meant we come not by the way of accusation to taint that honor every good tongue blesses nor to betray you any way to sorrow  you have too much good lady but to know how you stand minded in the weighty difference between the king and you and to deliver like free and honest men our just opinions and comforts to your cause madam you wrong the king's love with these fears your hopes and friends are infinite he tells you rightly madam this is a mere distraction you turn the good we offer into envy madam you wander from the good we aim at pray hear me if your grace could but be brought to know our ends are honest you'd feel more comfort why should we good lady upon what cause wrong you alas our places the way of our profession is against it we are to cure such sorrows not to sow 'em for goodness' sake consider what you do how you may hurt yourself ay utterly grow from the king's acquaintance by this carriage the hearts of princes kiss obedience so much they love it but to stubborn spirits they swell and grow as terrible as storms i know you have a gentle noble temper a soul as even as a calm pray think us those we profess peacemakers friends and servants the packet cromwell gave 't you the king looked he o' th' inside of the paper is he ready to come abroad leave me awhile it shall be to the duchess of alençon the french king's sister he shall marry her anne bullen no i'll no anne bullens for him there's more in 't than fair visage bullen no we'll no bullens speedily i wish to hear from rome the marchioness of pembroke the late queen's gentlewoman a knight's daughter to be her mistress' mistress the queen's queen this candle burns not clear 'tis i must snuff it then out it goes what though i know her virtuous and well deserving yet i know her for a spleeny lutheran and not wholesome to our cause that she should lie i' th' bosom of our hard ruled king again there is sprung up an heretic an arch one cranmer one hath crawled into the favor of the king and is his oracle heaven forgive me ever god bless your highness sir for holy offices i have a time a time to think upon the part of business which i bear i' th' state and nature does require her times of preservation which perforce i her frail son amongst my brethren mortal must give my tendance to and ever may your highness yoke together as i will lend you cause my doing well with my well saying what should this mean my sovereign i confess your royal graces showered on me daily have been more than could my studied purposes requite which went beyond all man's endeavors my endeavors have ever come too short of my desires yet filed with my abilities mine own ends have been mine so that evermore they pointed to th' good of your most sacred person and the profit of the state for your great graces heaped upon me poor undeserver i can nothing render but allegiant thanks my prayers to heaven for you my loyalty which ever has and ever shall be growing till death that winter kill it i do profess that for your highness' good i ever labored more than mine own that am have and will be  though all the world should crack their duty to you and throw it from their soul though perils did abound as thick as thought could make 'em and appear in forms more horrid yet my duty as doth a rock against the chiding flood should the approach of this wild river break and stand unshaken yours what should this mean what sudden anger's this how have i reaped it he parted frowning from me as if ruin leaped from his eyes so looks the chafèd lion upon the daring huntsman that has galled him then makes him nothing i must read this paper  i fear the story of his anger 'tis so this paper has undone me 'tis th' accompt of all that world of wealth i have drawn together for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom and fee my friends in rome o negligence fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil made me put this main secret in the packet i sent the king is there no way to cure this no new device to beat this from his brains i know 'twill stir him strongly yet i know a way if it take right in spite of fortune will bring me off again what's this to th' pope the letter as i live with all the business i writ to 's holiness nay then farewell i have touched the highest point of all my greatness and from that full meridian of my glory i haste now to my setting i shall fall like a bright exhalation in the evening and no man see me more stay where's your commission lords words cannot carry authority so weighty till i find more than will or words to do it  i mean your malice know officious lords i dare and must deny it now i feel of what coarse metal you are molded envy how eagerly you follow my disgraces as if it fed you and how sleek and wanton you appear in everything may bring my ruin follow your envious courses men of malice you have christian warrant for 'em and no doubt in time will find their fit rewards that seal you ask with such a violence the king mine and your master with his own hand gave me bade me enjoy it with the place and honors during my life and to confirm his goodness tied it by letters patents now who'll take it it must be himself then proud lord thou liest within these forty hours surrey durst better have burnt that tongue than said so this and all else this talking lord can lay upon my credit i answer is most false the duke by law found his deserts how innocent i was from any private malice in his end his noble jury and foul cause can witness  if i loved many words lord i should tell you you have as little honesty as honor that in the way of loyalty and truth toward the king my ever royal master dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be and all that love his follies all goodness is poison to thy stomach how much methinks i could despise this man but that i am bound in charity against it so much fairer and spotless shall mine innocence arise when the king knows my truth speak on sir i dare your worst objections if i blush it is to see a nobleman want manners so farewell to the little good you bear me farewell a long farewell to all my greatness this is the state of man today he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honors thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is a ripening nips his root and then he falls as i do i have ventured like little wanton boys that swim on bladders this many summers in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth my high blown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must forever hide me vain pomp and glory of this world i hate you i feel my heart new opened o how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin more pangs and fears than wars or women have and when he falls he falls like lucifer never to hope again why how now cromwell what amazed at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline nay an you weep i am fall'n indeed why well never so truly happy my good cromwell i know myself now and i feel within me a peace above all earthly dignities a still and quiet conscience the king has cured me  i humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders these ruined pillars out of pity taken a load would sink a navy too much honor o 'tis a burden cromwell 'tis a burden too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven i hope i have i am able now methinks out of a fortitude of soul i feel to endure more miseries and greater far than my weak hearted enemies dare offer what news abroad god bless him that's somewhat sudden but he's a learnèd man may he continue long in his highness' favor and do justice for truth's sake and his conscience that his bones when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings may have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on him what more that's news indeed there was the weight that pulled me down o cromwell the king has gone beyond me all my glories in that one woman i have lost forever no sun shall ever usher forth mine honors or gild again the noble troops that waited upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell i am a poor fall'n man unworthy now to be thy lord and master seek the king that sun i pray may never set i have told him what and how true thou art he will advance thee some little memory of me will stir him  i know his noble nature not to let thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell neglect him not make use now and provide for thine own future safety cromwell i did not think to shed a tear in all my miseries but thou hast forced me out of thy honest truth to play the woman let's dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell and when i am forgotten as i shall be and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention of me more must be heard of say i taught thee say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory and sounded all the depths and shoals of honor found thee a way out of his wrack to rise in a sure and safe one though thy master missed it mark but my fall and that that ruined me cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition by that sin fell the angels how can man then the image of his maker hope to win by it love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee corruption wins not more than honesty still in thy right hand carry gentle peace to silence envious tongues be just and fear not let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's thy god's and truth's then if thou fall'st o cromwell thou fall'st a blessèd martyr serve the king and prithee lead me in there take an inventory of all i have to the last penny 'tis the king's my robe and my integrity to heaven is all i dare now call mine own o cromwell cromwell had i but served my god with half the zeal i served my king he would not in mine age have left me naked to mine enemies so i have farewell the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell
