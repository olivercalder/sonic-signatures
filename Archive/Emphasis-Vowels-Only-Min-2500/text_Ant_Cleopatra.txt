if it be love indeed tell me how much i'll set a bourn how far to be beloved nay hear them antony fulvia perchance is angry or who knows if the scarce bearded caesar have not sent his powerful mandate to you do this or this take in that kingdom and enfranchise that perform 't or else we damn thee perchance nay and most like you must not stay here longer your dismission is come from caesar therefore hear it antony where's fulvia's process caesar's i would say both call in the messengers as i am egypt's queen thou blushest antony and that blood of thine is caesar's homager else so thy cheek pays shame when shrill tongued fulvia scolds the messengers excellent falsehood why did he marry fulvia and not love her i'll seem the fool i am not antony will be himself hear the ambassadors saw you my lord was he not here he was disposed to mirth but on the sudden a roman thought hath struck him enobarbus seek him and bring him hither where's alexas we will not look upon him go with us where is he see where he is who's with him what he does i did not send you if you find him sad say i am dancing if in mirth report that i am sudden sick quick and return what should i do i do not thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him i am sick and sullen help me away dear charmian i shall fall it cannot be thus long the sides of nature will not sustain it pray you stand farther from me i know by that same eye there's some good news what says the married woman you may go would she had never given you leave to come let her not say 'tis i that keep you here i have no power upon you hers you are o never was there queen so mightily betrayed yet at the first i saw the treasons planted why should i think you can be mine and true  though you in swearing shake the thron√®d gods  who have been false to fulvia riotous madness to be entangled with those mouth made vows which break themselves in swearing nay pray you seek no color for your going but bid farewell and go when you sued staying then was the time for words no going then eternity was in our lips and eyes bliss in our brows' bent none our parts so poor but was a race of heaven they are so still or thou the greatest soldier of the world art turned the greatest liar i would i had thy inches thou shouldst know there were a heart in egypt though age from folly could not give me freedom it does from childishness can fulvia die o most false love where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water now i see i see in fulvia's death how mine received shall be cut my lace charmian come but let it be i am quickly ill and well so antony loves so fulvia told me i prithee turn aside and weep for her then bid adieu to me and say the tears belong to egypt good now play one scene of excellent dissembling and let it look like perfect honor you can do better yet but this is meetly and target still he mends but this is not the best look prithee charmian how this herculean roman does become the carriage of his chafe courteous lord one word sir you and i must part but that's not it sir you and i have loved but there's not it that you know well something it is i would  o my oblivion is a very antony and i am all forgotten 'tis sweating labor to bear such idleness so near the heart as cleopatra this but sir forgive me since my becomings kill me when they do not eye well to you your honor calls you hence

for so he calls me now i feed myself with most delicious poison think on me that am with phoebus' amorous pinches black and wrinkled deep in time broad fronted caesar when thou wast here above the ground i was a morsel for a monarch and great pompey would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow there would he anchor his aspect and die with looking on his life how much unlike art thou mark antony yet coming from him that great med'cine hath with his tinct gilded thee how goes it with my brave mark antony mine ear must pluck it thence what was he sad or merry o well divided disposition note him note him good charmian 'tis the man but note him he was not sad for he would shine on those that make their looks by his he was not merry which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay in egypt with his joy but between both o heavenly mingle be'st thou sad or merry the violence of either thee becomes so does it no man's else met'st thou my posts who's born that day when i forget to send to antony shall die a beggar ink and paper charmian  welcome my good alexas did i charmian ever love caesar so be choked with such another emphasis say the brave antony by isis i will give thee

patience and that night i laughed him into patience and next morn ere the ninth hour i drunk him to his bed then put my tires and mantles on him whilst i wore his sword philippan o from italy ram thou

bluest veins to kiss a hand that kings have lipped and trembled kissing why there's more gold but sirrah mark we use to say the dead are well bring it to that the gold i give thee will i melt and pour down thy ill uttering throat well go to i will but there's no goodness in thy face if antony be free and healthful so tart a favor to trumpet such good tidings if not well thou shouldst come like a fury crowned with snakes not like a formal man i have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st yet if thou say antony lives is well or friends with caesar or not captive to him i'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail rich pearls upon thee well said th' art an honest man make thee a fortune from me i do not like but yet it does allay the good precedence fie upon but yet but yet is as a jailer to bring forth some monstrous malefactor prithee friend pour out the pack of matter to mine ear the good and bad together he's friends with caesar in state of health thou say'st and thou say'st free for what good turn i am pale charmian the most infectious pestilence upon thee what say you hence horrible villain or i'll spurn thine eyes like balls before me i'll unhair thy head thou shalt be

this wherefore is this have you done yet i must stay his time not know me yet ah dear if i be so from my cold heart let heaven engender hail and poison it in the source and the first stone drop in my neck as it determines so dissolve my life the next caesarion smite till by degrees the memory of my womb together with my brave egyptians all by the discandying of this pelleted storm lie graveless till the flies and gnats of nile have buried them for prey that's my brave lord it is my birthday i had thought t' have held it poor but since my lord is antony again i will be cleopatra call all his noble captains to my lord what means this what does he mean sleep a little nay i'll help too what's this for sooth la i'll help thus it must be is not this buckled well lead me he goes forth gallantly that he and caesar might determine this great war in single fight then antony but now  well on lord of lords o infinite virtue com'st thou smiling from the world's great snare uncaught i'll give thee friend an armor all of gold it was a king's why is my lord enraged against his love help me my women o he's more mad than telamon for his shield the boar of thessaly was never so embossed to th' monument  mardian go tell him i have slain myself say that the last i spoke was antony and word it prithee piteously hence mardian and bring me how he takes my death to th' monument o charmian i will never go from hence no i will not all strange and terrible events are welcome but comforts we despise our size of sorrow proportioned to our cause must be as great as that which makes it how now is he dead o sun burn the great sphere thou mov'st in darkling stand the varying shore o' th' world o antony antony antony help charmian help iras help help friends below let's draw him hither so it should be that none but antony should conquer antony but woe 'tis so i dare not dear dear my lord pardon i dare not lest i be taken not th' imperious show of the full fortuned caesar ever shall be brooched with me if knife drugs serpents have edge sting or operation i am safe your wife octavia with her modest eyes and still conclusion shall acquire no honor demuring upon me but come come antony  help me my women we must draw thee up  assist good friends here's sport indeed how heavy weighs my lord our strength is all gone into heaviness that makes the weight had i great juno's power the strong winged mercury should fetch thee up and set thee by jove's side yet come a little wishers were ever fools o come come come and welcome welcome die when thou hast lived quicken with kissing had my lips that power thus would i wear them out no let me speak and let me rail so high that the false huswife fortune break her wheel provoked by my offense they do not go together my resolution and my hands i'll trust none about caesar noblest of men woo't die hast thou no care of me shall i abide in this dull world which in thy absence is no better than a sty o see my women the crown o' th' earth doth melt my lord o withered is the garland of the war the soldier's pole is fall'n young boys and girls are level now with men the odds is gone and there is nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting moon no more but e'en a woman and commanded by such poor passion as the maid that milks and does the meanest chares it were for me to throw my scepter at the injurious gods to tell them that this world did equal theirs till they had stolen our jewel all's but naught patience is sottish and impatience does become a dog that's mad then is it sin to rush into the secret house of death ere death dare come to us how do you women what what good cheer why how now charmian my noble girls ah women women look our lamp is spent it's out good sirs take heart we'll bury him and then what's brave what's noble let's do 't after the high roman fashion and make death proud to take us come away this case of that huge spirit now is cold ah women women come we have no friend but resolution and the briefest end my desolation does begin to make a better life 'tis paltry to be caesar not being fortune he's but fortune's knave a minister of her will and it is great to do that thing that ends all other deeds which shackles accidents and bolts up change which sleeps and never palates more the dung the beggar's nurse and caesar's what's thy name antony did tell me of you bade me trust you but i do not greatly care to be deceived that have no use for trusting if your master would have a queen his beggar you must tell him that majesty to keep decorum must no less beg than a kingdom if he please to give me conquered egypt for my son he gives me so much of mine own as i will kneel to him with thanks pray you tell him i am his fortune's vassal and i send him the greatness he has got i hourly learn a doctrine of obedience and would gladly look him i' th' face quick quick good hands what of death too that rids our dogs of languish where art thou death come hither come come come and take a queen worth many babes and beggars sir i will eat no meat i'll not drink sir if idle talk will once be necessary  i'll not sleep neither this mortal house i'll ruin do caesar what he can know sir that i will not wait pinioned at your master's court nor once be chastised with the sober eye of dull octavia shall they hoist me up and show me to the shouting varletry of censuring rome rather a ditch in egypt be gentle grave unto me rather on nilus' mud lay me stark naked and let the waterflies blow me into abhorring rather make my country's high pyramides my gibbet and hang me up in chains say i would die i cannot tell no matter sir what i have heard or known you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams is 't not your trick i dreamt there was an emperor antony o such another sleep that i might see but such another man his face was as the heavens and therein stuck a sun and moon which kept their course and lighted the little o the earth his legs bestrid the ocean his reared arm crested the world his voice was propertied as all the tun√®d spheres and that to friends but when he meant to quail and shake the orb he was as rattling thunder for his bounty there was no winter in 't an autumn 'twas that grew the more by reaping his delights were dolphin like they showed his back above the element they lived in in his livery walked crowns and crownets realms and islands were as plates dropped from his pocket think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamt of you lie up to the hearing of the gods but if there be nor ever were one such it's past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy yet t' imagine an antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy condemning shadows quite i thank you sir know you what caesar means to do with me nay pray you sir he'll lead me then in triumph sir the gods will have it thus my master and my lord i must obey sole sir o' th' world i cannot project mine own cause so well to make it clear but do confess i have been laden with like frailties which before have often shamed our sex and may through all the world 'tis yours and we your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall hang in what place you please here my good lord this is the brief of money plate and jewels i am possessed of 'tis exactly valued not petty things admitted where's seleucus this is my treasurer let him speak my lord upon his peril that i have reserved to myself nothing speak the truth seleucus what have i kept back see caesar o behold how pomp is followed mine will now be yours and should we shift estates yours would be mine the ingratitude of this seleucus does even make me wild o slave of no more trust than love that's hired what goest thou back thou shalt go back i warrant thee but i'll catch thine eyes though they had wings slave soulless villain dog o rarely base o caesar what a wounding shame is this that thou vouchsafing here to visit me doing the honor of thy lordliness to one so meek that mine own servant should parcel the sum of my disgraces by addition of his envy say good caesar that i some lady trifles have reserved immoment toys things of such dignity as we greet modern friends withal and say some nobler token i have kept apart for livia and octavia to induce their mediation must i be unfolded with one that i have bred the gods it smites me beneath the fall i have prithee go hence or i shall show the cinders of my spirits through th' ashes of my chance wert thou a man thou wouldst have mercy on me be it known that we the greatest are misthought for things that others do and when we fall we answer others' merits in our name  are therefore to be pitied my master and my lord he words me girls he words me that i should not be noble to myself but hark thee charmian hie thee again i have spoke already and it is provided go put it to the haste dolabella dolabella i shall remain your debtor farewell and thanks now iras what think'st thou thou an egyptian puppet shall be shown in rome as well as i mechanic slaves with greasy aprons rules and hammers shall uplift us to the view in their thick breaths rank of gross diet shall we be enclouded and forced to drink their vapor nay 'tis most certain iras saucy lictors will catch at us like strumpets and scald rhymers ballad us out o' tune the quick comedians extemporally will stage us and present our alexandrian revels antony shall be brought drunken forth and i shall see some squeaking cleopatra boy my greatness i' th' posture of a whore nay that's certain why that's the way to fool their preparation and to conquer their most absurd intents now charmian show me my women like a queen go fetch my best attires i am again for cydnus to meet mark antony sirrah iras go  now noble charmian we'll dispatch indeed and when thou hast done this chare i'll give thee leave to play till doomsday bring our crown and all wherefore's this noise let him come in what poor an instrument may do a noble deed he brings me liberty my resolution's placed and i have nothing of woman in me now from head to foot i am marble constant now the fleeting moon no planet is of mine avoid and leave him hast thou the pretty worm of nilus there that kills and pains not remember'st thou any that have died on 't get thee hence farewell farewell ay ay farewell take thou no care it shall be heeded will it eat me well get thee gone farewell give me my robe put on my crown i have immortal longings in me now no more the juice of egypt's grape shall moist this lip yare yare good iras quick methinks i hear antony call i see him rouse himself to praise my noble act i hear him mock the luck of caesar which the gods give men to excuse their after wrath husband i come now to that name my courage prove my title i am fire and air my other elements i give to baser life so have you done come then and take the last warmth of my lips farewell kind charmian iras long farewell have i the aspic in my lips dost fall if thou and nature can so gently part the stroke of death is as a lover's pinch which hurts and is desired dost thou lie still if thus thou vanishest thou tell'st the world it is not worth leave taking this proves me base if she first meet the curl√®d antony he'll make demand of her and spend that kiss which is my heaven to have come thou mortal wretch with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate of life at once untie poor venomous fool be angry and dispatch o couldst thou speak that i might hear thee call great caesar ass unpolicied peace peace dost thou not see my baby at my breast that sucks the nurse asleep as sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle  o antony nay i will take thee too what should i stay
