agamemnon thou great commander nerves and bone of greece heart of our numbers soul and only sprite in whom the tempers and the minds of all should be shut up hear what ulysses speaks besides th' applause and approbation the which most mighty for thy place and sway and thou most reverend for thy stretched out life i give to both your speeches which were such as agamemnon and the hand of greece should hold up high in brass and such again as venerable nestor hatched in silver should with a bond of air strong as the axletree on which heaven rides knit all the greekish ears to his experienced tongue yet let it please both thou great and wise to hear ulysses speak troy yet upon his basis had been down and the great hector's sword had lacked a master but for these instances the specialty of rule hath been neglected and look how many grecian tents do stand hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions when that the general is not like the hive to whom the foragers shall all repair what honey is expected degree being vizarded th' unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask the heavens themselves the planets and this center observe degree priority and place insisture course proportion season form office and custom in all line of order and therefore is the glorious planet sol in noble eminence enthroned and sphered amidst the other whose med'cinable eye corrects the influence of evil planets and posts like the commandment of a king sans check to good and bad but when the planets in evil mixture to disorder wander what plagues and what portents what mutiny what raging of the sea shaking of earth commotion in the winds frights changes horrors divert and crack rend and deracinate the unity and married calm of states quite from their fixture o when degree is shaked which is the ladder of all high designs the enterprise is sick how could communities degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities peaceful commerce from dividable shores the primogeneity and due of birth prerogative of age crowns scepters laurels but by degree stand in authentic place take but degree away untune that string and hark what discord follows each thing meets in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters should lift their bosoms higher than the shores and make a sop of all this solid globe strength should be lord of imbecility and the rude son should strike his father dead force should be right or rather right and wrong between whose endless jar justice resides should lose their names and so should justice too then everything includes itself in power power into will will into appetite and appetite an universal wolf so doubly seconded with will and power must make perforce an universal prey and last eat up himself great agamemnon this chaos when degree is suffocate follows the choking and this neglection of degree it is that by a pace goes backward with a purpose it hath to climb the general's disdained by him one step below he by the next that next by him beneath so every step exampled by the first pace that is sick of his superior grows to an envious fever of pale and bloodless emulation and 'tis this fever that keeps troy on foot not her own sinews to end a tale of length troy in our weakness stands not in her strength the great achilles whom opinion crowns the sinew and the forehand of our host having his ear full of his airy fame grows dainty of his worth and in his tent lies mocking our designs with him patroclus upon a lazy bed the live long day breaks scurril jests and with ridiculous and silly action which slanderer he imitation calls he pageants us sometime great agamemnon thy topless deputation he puts on and like a strutting player whose conceit lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich to hear the wooden dialogue and sound 'twixt his stretched footing and the scaffollage such to be pitied and o'erwrested seeming he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks 'tis like a chime a mending with terms unsquared which from the tongue of roaring typhon dropped would seem hyperboles at this fusty stuff the large achilles on his pressed bed lolling from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause cries excellent 'tis agamemnon right now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard as he being dressed to some oration that's done as near as the extremest ends of parallels as like as vulcan and his wife yet god achilles still cries excellent 'tis nestor right now play him me patroclus arming to answer in a night alarm and then forsooth the faint defects of age must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit and with a palsy fumbling on his gorget shake in and out the rivet and at this sport sir valor dies cries o enough patroclus or give me ribs of steel i shall split all in pleasure of my spleen and in this fashion all our abilities gifts natures shapes severals and generals of grace exact achievements plots orders preventions excitements to the field or speech for truce success or loss what is or is not serves as stuff for these two to make paradoxes they tax our policy and call it cowardice count wisdom as no member of the war forestall prescience and esteem no act but that of hand the still and mental parts that do contrive how many hands shall strike when fitness calls them on and know by measure of their observant toil the enemy's weight  why this hath not a fingers dignity they call this bed work mapp'ry closet war so that the ram that batters down the wall for the great swinge and rudeness of his poise they place before his hand that made the engine or those that with the fineness of their souls by reason guide his execution amen nestor i have a young conception in my brain be you my time to bring it to some shape this 'tis blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride that hath to this maturity blown up in rank achilles must or now be cropped or shedding breed a nursery of like evil to overbulk us all this challenge that the gallant hector sends however it is spread in general name relates in purpose only to achilles and wake him to the answer think you give pardon to my speech therefore 'tis meet achilles meet not hector let us like merchants first show foul wares and think perchance they'll sell if not the luster of the better shall exceed by showing the worse first do not consent that ever hector and achilles meet for both our honor and our shame in this are dogged with two strange followers what glory our achilles shares from hector were he not proud we all should share with him but he already is too insolent and it were better parch in afric sun than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes should he scape hector fair if he were foiled why then we do our main opinion crush in taint of our best man no make a lott'ry and by device let blockish ajax draw the sort to fight with hector among ourselves give him allowance for the better man for that will physic the great myrmidon who broils in loud applause and make him fall his crest that prouder than blue iris bends if the dull brainless ajax come safe off we'll dress him up in voices if he fail yet go we under our opinion still that we have better men but hit or miss our project's life this shape of sense assumes ajax employed plucks down achilles' plumes we saw him at the opening of his tent he is not sick achilles hath inveigled his fool from him he no you see he is his argument that has his argument achilles the amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie here comes patroclus the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure achilles will not to the field tomorrow he doth rely on none but carries on the stream of his dispose without observance or respect of any in will peculiar and in self admission things small as nothing for request's sake only he makes important possessed he is with greatness and speaks not to himself but with a pride that quarrels at self breath imagined worth holds in his blood such swoll'n and hot discourse that 'twixt his mental and his active parts kingdomed achilles in commotion rages and batters down himself what should i say he is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it cry no recovery o agamemnon let it not be so we'll consecrate the steps that ajax makes when they go from achilles shall the proud lord that bastes his arrogance with his own seam and never suffers matter of the world enter his thoughts save such as doth revolve and ruminate himself shall he be worshipped of that we hold an idol more than he no this thrice worthy and right valiant lord shall not so stale his palm nobly acquired nor by my will assubjugate his merit as amply titled as achilles is by going to achilles that were to enlard his fat already pride and add more coals to cancer when he burns with entertaining great hyperion this lord go to him jupiter forbid and say in thunder achilles go to him not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel the raven chides blackness wit would be out of fashion he would have ten shares my lord you feed too much on this dislike why 'tis this naming of him does him harm here is a man but 'tis before his face i will be silent know the whole world he is as valiant  if he were proud  ay or surly borne  thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure praise him that gat thee she that gave thee suck famed be thy tutor and thy parts of nature thrice famed beyond beyond thy erudition but he that disciplined thine arms to fight let mars divide eternity in twain and give him half and for thy vigor bull bearing milo his addition yield to sinewy ajax i will not praise thy wisdom which like a bourn a pale a shore confines thy spacious and dilated parts here's nestor instructed by the antiquary times he must he is he cannot but be wise  but pardon father nestor were your days as green as ajax' and your brain so tempered you should not have the eminence of him but be as ajax there is no tarrying here the hart achilles keeps thicket please it our great general to call together all his state of war fresh kings are come to troy tomorrow we must with all our main of power stand fast and here's a lord come knights from east to west and cull their flower ajax shall cope the best achilles stands i' th' entrance of his tent please it our general pass strangely by him as if he were forgot and princes all lay negligent and loose regard upon him i will come last 'tis like he'll question me why such unplausive eyes are bent why turned on him if so i have derision medicinable to use between your strangeness and his pride which his own will shall have desire to drink it may do good pride hath no other glass to show itself but pride for supple knees feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees now great thetis' son  a strange fellow here writes me that man how dearly ever parted how much in having or without or in cannot make boast to have that which he hath nor feels not what he owes but by reflection as when his virtues shining upon others heat them and they retort that heat again to the first giver i do not strain at the position  it is familiar but at the author's drift who in his circumstance expressly proves that no man is the lord of anything  though in and of him there be much consisting  till he communicate his parts to others nor doth he of himself know them for aught till he behold them formed in the applause where they're extended who like an arch reverb'rate the voice again or like a gate of steel fronting the sun receives and renders back his figure and his heat i was much rapt in this and apprehended here immediately th' unknown ajax heavens what a man is there a very horse that has he knows not what nature what things there are most abject in regard and dear in use what things again most dear in the esteem and poor in worth now shall we see tomorrow  an act that very chance doth throw upon him  ajax renowned o heavens what some men do while some men leave to do how some men creep in skittish fortune's hall whiles others play the idiots in her eyes how one man eats into another's pride while pride is fasting in his wantonness to see these grecian lords why even already they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder as if his foot were on brave hector's breast and great troy shrieking time hath my lord a wallet at his back wherein he puts alms for oblivion a great sized monster of ingratitudes those scraps are good deeds past which are devoured as fast as they are made forgot as soon as done perseverance dear my lord keeps honor bright to have done is to hang quite out of fashion like a rusty mail in monumental mock'ry take the instant way for honor travels in a strait so narrow where one but goes abreast keep then the path for emulation hath a thousand sons that one by one pursue if you give way or turn aside from the direct forthright like to an entered tide they all rush by and leave you hindmost or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank lie there for pavement to the abject rear o'errun and trampled on then what they do in present though less than yours in past must o'ertop yours for time is like a fashionable host that slightly shakes his parting guest by th' hand and with his arms outstretched as he would fly grasps in the comer welcome ever smiles and farewell goes out sighing let not virtue seek remuneration for the thing it was for beauty wit high birth vigor of bone desert in service love friendship charity are subjects all to envious and calumniating time one touch of nature makes the whole world kin that all with one consent praise newborn gauds though they are made and molded of things past and give to dust that is a little gilt more laud than gilt o'erdusted the present eye praises the present object then marvel not thou great and complete man that all the greeks begin to worship ajax since things in motion sooner catch the eye than what stirs not the cry went once on thee and still it might and yet it may again if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive and case thy reputation in thy tent whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves and drave great mars to faction but 'gainst your privacy the reasons are more potent and heroical 'tis known achilles that you are in love with one of priam's daughters is that a wonder the providence that's in a watchful state knows almost every grain of pluto's gold finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deep keeps place with thought and almost like the gods do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles there is a mystery with whom relation durst never meddle in the soul of state which hath an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to all the commerce that you have had with troy as perfectly is ours as yours my lord and better would it fit achilles much to throw down hector than polyxena but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home when fame shall in our islands sound her trump and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing great hector's sister did achilles win but our great ajax bravely beat down him farewell my lord i as your lover speak the fool slides o'er the ice that you should break no trumpet answers 'tis he i ken the manner of his gait he rises on the toe that spirit of his in aspiration lifts him from the earth yet is the kindness but particular 'twere better she were kissed in general o deadly gall and theme of all our scorns for which we lose our heads to gild his horns it were no match your nail against his horn may i sweet lady beg a kiss of you i do desire it why then for venus' sake give me a kiss when helen is a maid again and his never's my day and then a kiss of you fie fie upon her there's language in her eye her cheek her lip nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out at every joint and motive of her body o these encounterers so glib of tongue that give accosting welcome ere it comes and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts to every tickling reader set them down for sluttish spoils of opportunity and daughters of the game the trojan's trumpet they are opposed already the youngest son of priam a true knight not yet mature yet matchless firm of word speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calmed his heart and hand both open and both free for what he has he gives what thinks he shows yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty nor dignifies an impair thought with breath manly as hector but more dangerous for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes to tender objects but he in heat of action is more vindicative than jealous love they call him troilus and on him erect a second hope as fairly built as hector thus says aeneas one that knows the youth even to his inches and with private soul did in great ilium thus translate him to me i wonder now how yonder city stands when we have here her base and pillar by us sir i foretold you then what would ensue my prophecy is but half his journey yet for yonder walls that pertly front your town yon towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds must kiss their own feet so to him we leave it most gentle and most valiant hector welcome after the general i beseech you next to feast with me and see me at my tent at menelaus' tent most princely troilus there diomed doth feast with him tonight who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth but gives all gaze and bent of amorous view on the fair cressid you shall command me sir as gentle tell me of what honor was this cressida in troy had she no lover there that wails her absence here comes himself to guide you follow his torch he goes to calchas' tent i'll keep you company stand where the torch may not discover us she will sing any man at first sight list how now trojan you are moved prince let us depart i pray you lest your displeasure should enlarge itself to wrathful terms this place is dangerous the time right deadly i beseech you go nay good my lord go off you flow to great distraction come my lord you have not patience come how now my lord you shake my lord at something will you go you will break out come come you have sworn patience my lord  all's done my lord why stay we then i cannot conjure trojan most sure she was nor mine my lord cressid was here but now what hath she done prince that can soil our mothers may worthy troilus be half attached with that which here his passion doth express o contain yourself your passion draws ears hither i'll bring you to the gates o courage courage princes great achilles is arming weeping cursing vowing vengeance patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood together with his mangled myrmidons that noseless handless hacked and chipped come to him crying on hector ajax hath lost a friend and foams at mouth and he is armed and at it roaring for troilus who hath done today mad and fantastic execution engaging and redeeming of himself with such a careless force and forceless care as if that luck in very spite of cunning bade him win all
