{"3H6_EdwardIV": "lord stafford's father duke of buckingham is either slain or wounded dangerous i cleft his beaver with a downright blow that this is true father behold his blood sweet father do so set it on your head no i can better play the orator no quarrel but a slight contention now you are heir therefore enjoy it now by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe it will outrun you father in the end but for a kingdom any oath may be broken i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year i hear their drums let's set our men in order and issue forth and bid them battle straight i wonder how our princely father scaped or whether he be scaped away or no from clifford's and northumberland's pursuit had he been ta'en we should have heard the news had he been slain we should have heard the news or had he scaped methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape how fares my brother why is he so sad dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns 'tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of i think it cites us brother to the field that we the sons of brave plantagenet each one already blazing by our meeds should notwithstanding join our lights together and overshine the earth as this the world whate'er it bodes henceforward will i bear upon my target three fair shining suns o speak no more for i have heard too much sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay o clifford boist'rous clifford thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquished him for hand to hand he would have vanquished thee now my soul's palace is become a prison ah would she break from hence that this my body might in the ground be clos\u00e8d up in rest for never henceforth shall i joy again never o never shall i see more joy his name that valiant duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left o warwick warwick that plantagenet which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption is by the stern lord clifford done to death where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou fail'st as god forbid the hour  must edward fall which peril heaven forfend then strike up drums god and saint george for us now perjured henry wilt thou kneel for grace and set thy diadem upon my head or bide the mortal fortune of the field i am his king and he should bow his knee i was adopted heir by his consent since when his oath is broke for as i hear you that are king though he do wear the crown have caused him by new act of parliament to blot out me and put his own son in say henry shall i have my right or no a thousand men have broke their fasts today that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns to make this shameless callet know herself  helen of greece was fairer far than thou although thy husband may be menelaus and ne'er was agamemnon's brother wronged by that false woman as this king by thee his father reveled in the heart of france and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop and had he matched according to his state he might have kept that glory to this day but when he took a beggar to his bed and graced thy poor sire with his bridal day even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him that washed his father's fortunes forth of france and heaped sedition on his crown at home for what hath broached this tumult but thy pride hadst thou been meek our title still had slept and we in pity of the gentle king had slipped our claim until another age and in this resolution i defy thee not willing any longer conference since thou denied'st the gentle king to speak  sound trumpets let our bloody colors wave and either victory or else a grave no wrangling woman we'll no longer stay these words will cost ten thousand lives this day smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death for this world frowns and edward's sun is clouded bootless is flight they follow us with wings and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit o warwick i do bend my knee with thine and in this vow do chain my soul to thine and ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee thou setter up and plucker down of kings beseeching thee if with thy will it stands that to my foes this body must be prey yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope and give sweet passage to my sinful soul now lords take leave until we meet again where'er it be in heaven or in earth now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks some troops pursue the bloody minded queen that led calm henry though he were a king as doth a sail filled with a fretting gust command an argosy to stem the waves but think you lords that clifford fled with them see who it is and now the battle's ended if friend or foe let him be gently used bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threat'ning sound and his ill boding tongue no more shall speak clifford repent in bootless penitence thou pitied'st rutland i will pity thee even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be for in thy shoulder do i build my seat and never will i undertake the thing wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting  richard i will create thee duke of gloucester and george of clarence warwick as ourself shall do and undo as him pleaseth best brother of gloucester at saint albans field this lady's husband sir richard grey was slain his land then seized on by the conqueror her suit is now to repossess those lands which we in justice cannot well deny because in quarrel of the house of york the worthy gentleman did lose his life it were no less but yet i'll make a pause widow we will consider of your suit and come some other time to know our mind how many children hast thou widow tell me 'twere pity they should lose their father's lands lords give us leave i'll try this widow's wit now tell me madam do you love your children and would you not do much to do them good then get your husband's lands to do them good i'll tell you how these lands are to be got what service wilt thou do me if i give them but you will take exceptions to my boon ay but thou canst do what i mean to ask an easy task 'tis but to love a king why then thy husband's lands i freely give thee but stay thee 'tis the fruits of love i mean ay but i fear me in another sense what love think'st thou i sue so much to get no by my troth i did not mean such love but now you partly may perceive my mind to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily ay if thou wilt say ay to my request no if thou dost say no to my demand her looks doth argue her replete with modesty her words doth show her wit incomparable all her perfections challenge sovereignty one way or other she is for a king and she shall be my love or else my queen  say that king edward take thee for his queen sweet widow by my state i swear to thee i speak no more than what my soul intends and that is to enjoy thee for my love you cavil widow i did mean my queen no more than when my daughters call thee mother thou art a widow and thou hast some children and by god's mother i being but a bachelor have other some why 'tis a happy thing to be the father unto many sons answer no more for thou shalt be my queen brothers you muse what chat we two have had you'd think it strange if i should marry her why clarence to myself well jest on brothers i can tell you both her suit is granted for her husband's lands see that he be conveyed unto the tower and go we brothers to the man that took him to question of his apprehension  widow go you along lords use her honorably now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent suppose they take offense without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwick's and must have my will yea brother richard are you offended too setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england's queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think what if both lewis and warwick be appeased by such invention as i can devise ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brother's will my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath now messenger what letters or what news from france go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henry's queen for i have heard that she was there in place belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarned they shall have wars and pay for their presumption but say is warwick friends with margaret clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i armed against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desp'rate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect now brother richard will you stand by us why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign power the duke why warwick when we parted thou call'dst me king yea brother of clarence art thou here too nay then i see that edward needs must down yet warwick in despite of all mischance of thee thyself and all thy complices edward will always bear himself as king though fortune's malice overthrow my state my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel what fates impose that men must needs abide it boots not to resist both wind and tide nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand  now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest stand you thus close to steal the bishop's deer but whither shall we then stanley i will requite thy forwardness huntsman what sayst thou wilt thou go along bishop farewell shield thee from warwick's frown and pray that i may repossess the crown now brother richard lord hastings and the rest yet thus far fortune maketh us amends and says that once more i shall interchange my wan\u00e8d state for henry's regal crown well have we passed and now re passed the seas and brought desir\u00e8d help from burgundy what then remains we being thus arrived from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york but that we enter as into our dukedom tush man abodements must not now affright us by fair or foul means we must enter in for hither will our friends repair to us but master mayor if henry be your king yet edward at the least is duke of york why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom as being well content with that alone so master mayor these gates must not be shut but in the night or in the time of war what fear not man but yield me up the keys for edward will defend the town and thee and all those friends that deign to follow me welcome sir john but why come you in arms thanks good montgomery but we now forget our title to the crown and only claim our dukedom till god please to send the rest nay stay sir john a while and we'll debate by what safe means the crown may be recovered when we grow stronger then we'll make our claim till then 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning then be it as you will for 'tis my right and henry but usurps the diadem thanks brave montgomery and thanks unto you all if fortune serve me i'll requite this kindness now for this night let's harbor here in york and when the morning sun shall raise his car above the border of this horizon we'll forward towards warwick and his mates for well i wot that henry is no soldier ah froward clarence how evil it beseems thee to flatter henry and forsake thy brother yet as we may we'll meet both thee and warwick come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day and that once gotten doubt not of large pay seize on the shamefaced henry bear him hence and once again proclaim us king of england  you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow now stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dry and swell so much the higher by their ebb  hence with him to the tower let him not speak and lords towards coventry bend we our course where peremptory warwick now remains the sun shines hot and if we use delay cold biting winter mars our hoped for hay go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle now warwick wilt thou ope the city gates speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee call edward king and at his hands beg mercy and he shall pardon thee these outrages why then 'tis mine if but by warwick's gift but warwick's king is edward's prisoner and gallant warwick do but answer this what is the body when the head is off 'tis even so yet you are warwick still sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend this hand fast wound about thy coal black hair shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off write in the dust this sentence with thy blood wind changing warwick now can change no more so other foes may set upon our backs stand we in good array for they no doubt will issue out again and bid us battle if not the city being but of small defense we'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same the harder matched the greater victory my mind presageth happy gain and conquest now welcome more and ten times more beloved than if thou never hadst deserved our hate what warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight or shall we beat the stones about thine ears yes warwick edward dares and leads the way  lords to the field saint george and victory so lie thou there die thou and die our fear for warwick was a bug that feared us all now montague sit fast i seek for thee that warwick's bones may keep thine company thus far our fortune keeps an upward course and we are graced with wreaths of victory but in the midst of this bright shining day i spy a black suspicious threat'ning cloud that will encounter with our glorious sun ere he attain his easeful western bed i mean my lords those powers that the queen hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast and as we hear march on to fight with us we are advertised by our loving friends that they do hold their course toward tewkesbury we having now the best at barnet field will thither straight for willingness rids way and as we march our strength will be augmented in every county as we go along strike up the drum cry courage and away brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood which by the heavens' assistance and your strength must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night i need not add more fuel to your fire for well i wot you blaze to burn them out give signal to the fight and to it lords now here a period of tumultuous broils away with oxford to hames castle straight for somerset off with his guilty head go bear them hence i will not hear them speak is proclamation made that who finds edward shall have a high reward and he his life bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak what can so young a thorn begin to prick  edward what satisfaction canst thou make for bearing arms for stirring up my subjects and all the trouble thou hast turned me to peace willful boy or i will charm your tongue take that the likeness of this railer here hold richard hold for we have done too much what doth she swoon use means for her recovery away with her go bear her hence perforce away i say i charge you bear her hence where's richard gone he's sudden if a thing comes in his head now march we hence discharge the common sort with pay and thanks and let's away to london and see our gentle queen how well she fares by this i hope she hath a son for me once more we sit in england's royal throne repurchased with the blood of enemies what valiant foemen like to autumn's corn have we mowed down in tops of all their pride three dukes of somerset threefold renowned for hardy and undoubted champions two cliffords as the father and the son and two northumberlands two braver men ne'er spurred their coursers at the trumpet's sound with them the two brave bears warwick and montague that in their chains fettered the kingly lion and made the forest tremble when they roared thus have we swept suspicion from our seat and made our footstool of security  come hither bess and let me kiss my boy  young ned for thee thine uncles and myself have in our armors watched the winter's night went all afoot in summer's scalding heat that thou mightst repossess the crown in peace and of our labors thou shalt reap the gain clarence and gloucester love my lovely queen and kiss your princely nephew brothers both thanks noble clarence worthy brother thanks now am i seated as my soul delights having my country's peace and brothers' loves away with her and waft her hence to france and now what rests but that we spend the time with stately triumphs mirthful comic shows such as befits the pleasure of the court sound drums and trumpets farewell sour annoy for here i hope begins our lasting joy", "R3_RichardIII": "now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of york and all the clouds that loured upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruis\u00e8d arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changed to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures grim visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barb\u00e8d steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous looking glass i that am rudely stamped and want love's majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph i that am curtailed of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deformed unfinished sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them  why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to see my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair well spoken days i am determin\u00e8d to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mewed up about a prophecy which says that g of edward's heirs the murderer shall be dive thoughts down to my soul here clarence comes brother good day what means this arm\u00e8d guard that waits upon your grace upon what cause alack my lord that fault is none of yours he should for that commit your godfathers o belike his majesty hath some intent that you should be new christened in the tower but what's the matter clarence may i know why this it is when men are ruled by women 'tis not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife clarence 'tis she that tempers him to this extremity was it not she and that good man of worship anthony woodeville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is delivered we are not safe clarence we are not safe humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty i'll tell you what i think it is our way if we will keep in favor with the king to be her men and wear her livery the jealous o'erworn widow and herself since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen are mighty gossips in our monarchy even so an please your worship brakenbury you may partake of anything we say we speak no treason man we say the king is wise and virtuous and his noble queen well struck in years fair and not jealous we say that shore's wife hath a pretty foot a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue and that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks how say you sir can you deny all this naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow he that doth naught with her excepting one were best to do it secretly alone we are the queen's abjects and must obey  brother farewell i will unto the king and whatsoe'er you will employ me in were it to call king edward's widow sister i will perform it to enfranchise you meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine well your imprisonment shall not be long i will deliver you or else lie for you meantime have patience go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return simple plain clarence i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven if heaven will take the present at our hands but who comes here the new delivered hastings as much unto my good lord chamberlain well are you welcome to the open air how hath your lordship brooked imprisonment no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too for they that were your enemies are his and have prevailed as much on him as you what news abroad now by saint john that news is bad indeed o he hath kept an evil diet long and overmuch consumed his royal person 'tis very grievous to be thought upon where is he in his bed go you before and i will follow you he cannot live i hope and must not die till george be packed with post horse up to heaven i'll in to urge his hatred more to clarence with lies well steeled with weighty arguments and if i fail not in my deep intent clarence hath not another day to live which done god take king edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in for then i'll marry warwick's youngest daughter what though i killed her husband and her father the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father the which will i not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto but yet i run before my horse to market clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns when they are gone then must i count my gains stay you that bear the corse and set it down villains set down the corse or by saint paul i'll make a corse of him that disobeys unmannered dog stand thou when i command  advance thy halberd higher than my breast or by saint paul i'll strike thee to my foot and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness sweet saint for charity be not so curst lady you know no rules of charity which renders good for bad blessings for curses but i know none and therefore am no beast more wonderful when angels are so angry vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman of these suppos\u00e8d crimes to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself fairer than tongue can name thee let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself by such despair i should accuse myself say that i slew them not i did not kill your husband nay he is dead and slain by edward's hands i was provok\u00e8d by her sland'rous tongue that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders i grant you the better for the king of heaven that hath him let him thank me that holp to send him thither for he was fitter for that place than earth yes one place else if you will hear me name it your bedchamber so will it madam till i lie with you i know so but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall something into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner your beauty was the cause of that effect  your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom these eyes could not endure that beauty's wrack you should not blemish it if i stood by as all the world is cheer\u00e8d by the sun so i by that it is my day my life curse not thyself fair creature thou art both it is a quarrel most unnatural to be revenged on him that loveth thee he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband he lives that loves thee better than he could plantagenet the selfsame name but one of better nature here why dost thou spit at me never came poison from so sweet a place thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears shamed their aspects with store of childish drops these eyes which never shed remorseful tear  no when my father york and edward wept to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when black faced clifford shook his sword at him nor when thy warlike father like a child told the sad story of my father's death and twenty times made pause to sob and weep that all the standers by had wet their cheeks like trees bedashed with rain in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is proposed my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made for kissing lady not for such contempt if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive lo here i lend thee this sharp pointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true breast and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee nay do not pause for i did kill king henry  but 'twas thy beauty that provok\u00e8d me nay now dispatch 'twas i that stabbed young edward  but 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on take up the sword again or take up me then bid me kill myself and i will do it that was in thy rage speak it again and even with the word this hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths shalt thou be accessory 'tis figured in my tongue then never was man true say then my peace is made but shall i live in hope vouchsafe to wear this ring look how my ring encompasseth thy finger even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart wear both of them for both of them are thine and if thy poor devoted servant may but beg one favor at thy gracious hand thou dost confirm his happiness forever that it may please you leave these sad designs to him that hath most cause to be a mourner and presently repair to crosby house where after i have solemnly interred at chertsey monast'ry this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears i will with all expedient duty see you for divers unknown reasons i beseech you grant me this boon bid me farewell no to whitefriars there attend my coming was ever woman in this humor wooed was ever woman in this humor won i'll have her but i will not keep her long what i that killed her husband and his father to take her in her heart's extremest hate with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes the bleeding witness of my hatred by having god her conscience and these bars against me and i no friends to back my suit at all but the plain devil and dissembling looks and yet to win her all the world to nothing ha hath she forgot already that brave prince edward her lord whom i some three months since stabbed in my angry mood at tewkesbury a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman framed in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal the spacious world cannot again afford and will she yet abase her eyes on me that cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woeful bed on me whose all not equals edward's moiety on me that halts and am misshapen thus my dukedom to a beggarly denier i do mistake my person all this while upon my life she finds although i cannot myself to be a marv'lous proper man i'll be at charges for a looking glass and entertain a score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body since i am crept in favor with myself i will maintain it with some little cost but first i'll turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass that i may see my shadow as i pass they do me wrong and i will not endure it who is it that complains unto the king that i forsooth am stern and love them not by holy paul they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumors because i cannot flatter and look fair smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog duck with french nods and apish courtesy i must be held a rancorous enemy cannot a plain man live and think no harm but thus his simple truth must be abused with silken sly insinuating jacks to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace when have i injured thee when done thee wrong  or thee or thee or any of your faction a plague upon you all his royal grace whom god preserve better than you would wish cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while but you must trouble him with lewd complaints i cannot tell the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch since every jack became a gentleman there's many a gentle person made a jack meantime god grants that we have need of you our brother is imprisoned by your means myself disgraced and the nobility held in contempt while great promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble you may deny that you were not the mean of my lord hastings' late imprisonment she may lord rivers why who knows not so she may do more sir than denying that she may help you to many fair preferments and then deny her aiding hand therein and lay those honors on your high desert what may she not she may ay marry may she  what marry may she marry with a king a bachelor and a handsome stripling too iwis your grandam had a worser match what threat you me with telling of the king tell him and spare not look what i have said i will avouch 't in presence of the king i dare adventure to be sent to th' tower 'tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot ere you were queen ay or your husband king i was a packhorse in his great affairs a weeder out of his proud adversaries a liberal rewarder of his friends to royalize his blood i spent mine own in all which time you and your husband grey were factious for the house of lancaster  and rivers so were you was not your husband in margaret's battle at saint albans slain let me put in your minds if you forget what you have been ere this and what you are withal what i have been and what i am poor clarence did forsake his father warwick ay and forswore himself which jesu pardon  to fight on edward's party for the crown and for his meed poor lord he is mewed up i would to god my heart were flint like edward's or edward's soft and pitiful like mine i am too childish foolish for this world if i should be i had rather be a peddler far be it from my heart the thought thereof foul wrinkled witch what mak'st thou in my sight wert thou not banish\u00e8d on pain of death the curse my noble father laid on thee when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper and with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes and then to dry them gav'st the duke a clout steeped in the faultless blood of pretty rutland  his curses then from bitterness of soul denounced against thee are all fall'n upon thee and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed have done thy charm thou hateful withered hag margaret ha i cry thee mercy then for i did think that thou hadst called me all these bitter names 'tis done by me and ends in margaret good counsel marry learn it learn it marquess ay and much more but i was born so high our aerie buildeth in the cedar's top and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun what doth she say my lord of buckingham i cannot blame her by god's holy mother she hath had too much wrong and i repent my part thereof that i have done to her yet you have all the vantage of her wrong i was too hot to do somebody good that is too cold in thinking of it now marry as for clarence he is well repaid he is franked up to fatting for his pains god pardon them that are the cause thereof so do i ever being well advised for had i cursed now i had cursed myself i do the wrong and first begin to brawl the secret mischiefs that i set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others clarence who i indeed have cast in darkness i do beweep to many simple gulls namely to derby hastings buckingham and tell them 'tis the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke my brother now they believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on rivers dorset grey but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that god bids us do good for evil and thus i clothe my naked villainy with odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil but soft here come my executioners  how now my hardy stout resolv\u00e8d mates are you now going to dispatch this thing well thought upon i have it here about me when you have done repair to crosby place but sirs be sudden in the execution withal obdurate do not hear him plead for clarence is well spoken and perhaps may move your hearts to pity if you mark him your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall tears i like you lads about your business straight go go dispatch good morrow to my sovereign king and queen and princely peers a happy time of day a bless\u00e8d labor my most sovereign lord among this princely heap if any here by false intelligence or wrong surmise hold me a foe if i unwittingly or in my rage have aught committed that is hardly borne by any in this presence i desire to reconcile me to his friendly peace 'tis death to me to be at enmity i hate it and desire all good men's love first madam i entreat true peace of you which i will purchase with my duteous service  of you my noble cousin buckingham if ever any grudge were lodged between us  of you and you lord rivers and of dorset that all without desert have frowned on me  of you lord woodeville and lord scales of you dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all i do not know that englishman alive with whom my soul is any jot at odds more than the infant that is born tonight i thank my god for my humility why madam have i offered love for this to be so flouted in this royal presence who knows not that the gentle duke is dead you do him injury to scorn his corse but he poor man by your first order died and that a wing\u00e8d mercury did bear some tardy cripple bare the countermand that came too lag to see him buri\u00e8d god grant that some less noble and less loyal nearer in bloody thoughts and not in blood deserve not worse than wretched clarence did and yet go current from suspicion this is the fruits of rashness

news give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep at crosby house there shall you find us both chop off his head something we will determine and look when i

may digest our complots in some form my noble lords and cousins all good morrow i have been long a sleeper but i trust my absence doth neglect no great design which by my presence might have been concluded than my lord hastings no man might be bolder his lordship knows me well and loves me well  my lord of ely when i was last in holborn i saw good strawberries in your garden there i do beseech you send for some of them cousin of buckingham a word with you catesby hath sounded hastings in our business and finds the testy gentleman so hot that he will lose his head ere give consent his master's child as worshipfully he terms it shall lose the royalty of england's throne i pray you all tell me what they deserve that do conspire my death with devilish plots of damn\u00e8d witchcraft and that have prevailed upon my body with their hellish charms then be your eyes the witness of their evil look how i am bewitched behold mine arm is like a blasted sapling withered up and this is edward's wife that monstrous witch consorted with that harlot strumpet shore that by their witchcraft thus have mark\u00e8d me if thou protector of this damn\u00e8d strumpet talk'st thou to me of ifs thou art a traitor  off with his head now by saint paul i swear i will not dine until i see the same  lovell and ratcliffe look that it be done  the rest that love me rise and follow me come cousin canst thou quake and change thy color murder thy breath in middle of a word and then again begin and stop again as if thou were distraught and mad with terror he is and see he brings the mayor along look to the drawbridge there catesby o'erlook the walls look back defend thee here are enemies be patient they are friends ratcliffe and lovell so dear i loved the man that i must weep i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathed upon the earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts so smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted  i mean his conversation with shore's wife  he lived from all attainder of suspects what think you we are turks or infidels or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly in the villain's death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons' safety enforced us to this execution and to that end we wished your lordship here t' avoid the censures of the carping world go after after cousin buckingham the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post there at your meetest vantage of the time infer the bastardy of edward's children tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown meaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was term\u00e8d so moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretched unto their servants daughters wives even where his raging eye or savage heart without control lusted to make a prey nay for a need thus far come near my person tell them when that my mother went with child of that insatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by true computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appear\u00e8d in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father yet touch this sparingly as 'twere far off because my lord you know my mother lives if you thrive well bring them to baynard's castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well learn\u00e8d bishops go lovell with all speed to doctor shaa go thou to friar penker bid them both meet me within this hour at baynard's castle now will i go to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give order that no manner person have any time recourse unto the princes how now how now what say the citizens touched you the bastardy of edward's children and did they so what tongueless blocks were they would they not speak will not the mayor then and his brethren come i go an if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt we bring it to a happy issue my lord there needs no such apology i do beseech your grace to pardon me who earnest in the service of my god deferred the visitation of my friends but leaving this what is your grace's pleasure i do suspect i have done some offense that seems disgracious in the city's eye and that you come to reprehend my ignorance else wherefore breathe i in a christian land i cannot tell if to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think tongue tied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so seasoned with your faithful love to me then on the other side i checked my friends therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as the ripe revenue and due of birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects that i would rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapor of my glory smothered but god be thanked there is no need of me and much i need to help you were there need the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellowed by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign on him i lay that you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him alas why would you heap this care on me i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you o do not swear my lord of buckingham will you enforce me to a world of cares call them again i am not made of stones but penetrable to your kind entreaties albeit against my conscience and my soul cousin of buckingham and sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burden whe'er i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foul faced reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god doth know and you may partly see how far i am from the desire of this in saying so you shall but say the truth even when you please for you will have it so come let us to our holy work again  farewell my cousin farewell gentle friends stand all apart cousin of buckingham give me thy hand thus high by thy advice and thy assistance is king richard seated but shall we wear these glories for a day or shall they last and we rejoice in them ah buckingham now do i play the touch to try if thou be current gold indeed young edward lives think now what i would speak why buckingham i say i would be king ha am i king 'tis so but edward lives o bitter consequence that edward still should live true noble prince cousin thou wast not wont to be so dull shall i be plain i wish the bastards dead and i would have it suddenly performed what sayst thou now speak suddenly be brief tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezes say have i thy consent that they shall die i will converse with iron witted fools and unrespective boys none are for me that look into me with considerate eyes high reaching buckingham grows circumspect  boy know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold will tempt unto a close exploit of death what is his name i partly know the man go call him hither boy

wife if she convey letters to richmond you shall answer it i do remember me henry the sixth did prophesy that richmond should be king when richmond was a little peevish boy a king perhaps  how chance the prophet could not at that time have told me i being by that i should kill him richmond when last i was at exeter the mayor in courtesy showed me the castle and called it rougemont at which name i started because a bard of ireland told me once i should not live long after i saw richmond ay what's o'clock well but what's o'clock well let it strike because that like a jack thou keep'st the stroke

touching richmond he said the truth and what said surrey then he was in the right and so indeed it is tell the clock there give me a calendar who saw the sun today then he disdains to shine for by the book he should have braved the east an hour ago a black day will it be to somebody ratcliffe the sun will not be seen today the sky doth frown and lour upon our army i would these dewy tears were from

you sleeping safe they bring to you unrest you having lands and blessed with beauteous wives they would restrain the one distain the other and who doth lead them but a paltry fellow long kept in brittany at our mother's cost a milksop one that never in his life felt so much cold as overshoes in snow let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again lash hence these overweening rags of france these famished beggars weary of their lives who but for dreaming on this fond exploit for want of means poor rats had hanged themselves if we be conquered let men conquer us and not these bastard bretons whom our fathers have in their own land beaten bobbed and thumped and in record left them the heirs of shame shall these enjoy our lands lie with our wives ravish our daughters hark i hear their drum fight gentlemen of england fight bold yeomen  draw archers draw your arrows to the head  spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood amaze the welkin with your broken staves  what says

inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons upon them victory sits on our helms a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse slave i have set my life upon a cast and i will stand the hazard of the die i think there be six richmonds in the field five have i slain today instead of him a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse", "1H6_Talbot": "the duke of bedford had a prisoner called the brave lord ponton de santrailles for him was i exchanged and ransom\u00e8d but with a baser man of arms by far once in contempt they would have bartered me which i disdaining scorned and crav\u00e8d death rather than i would be so vile esteemed in fine redeemed i was as i desired but o the treacherous fastolf wounds my heart whom with my bare fists i would execute if i now had him brought into my power with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts in open marketplace produced they me to be a public spectacle to all here said they is the terror of the french the scarecrow that affrights our children so then broke i from the officers that led me and with my nails digged stones out of the ground to hurl at the beholders of my shame my grisly countenance made others fly none durst come near for fear of sudden death in iron walls they deemed me not secure so great fear of my name 'mongst them were spread that they supposed i could rend bars of steel and spurn in pieces posts of adamant wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had that walked about me every minute while and if i did but stir out of my bed ready they were to shoot me to the heart for aught i see this city must be famished or with light skirmishes enfeebl\u00e8d what chance is this that suddenly hath crossed us  speak salisbury at least if thou canst speak how far'st thou mirror of all martial men one of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off  accurs\u00e8d tower accurs\u00e8d fatal hand that hath contrived this woeful tragedy in thirteen battles salisbury o'ercame henry the fifth he first trained to the wars whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up his sword did ne'er leave striking in the field  yet liv'st thou salisbury though thy speech doth fail one eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace the sun with one eye vieweth all the world heaven be thou gracious to none alive if salisbury wants mercy at thy hands  sir thomas gargrave hast thou any life speak unto talbot nay look up to him  bear hence his body i will help to bury it salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort thou shalt not die whiles  he beckons with his hand and smiles on me as who should say when i am dead and gone remember to avenge me on the french plantagenet i will and like thee nero play on the lute beholding the towns burn wretched shall france be only in my name what stir is this what tumult's in the heavens whence cometh this alarum and the noise hear hear how dying salisbury doth groan it irks his heart he cannot be revenged frenchmen i'll be a salisbury to you pucelle or puzel dauphin or dogfish your hearts i'll stamp out with my horse's heels and make a quagmire of your mingled brains convey we salisbury into his tent and then try what these dastard frenchmen dare where is my strength my valor and my force our english troops retire i cannot stay them a woman clad in armor chaseth them here here she comes i'll have a bout with thee devil or devil's dam i'll conjure thee blood will i draw on thee thou art a witch  and straightway give thy soul to him thou serv'st heavens can you suffer hell so to prevail my breast i'll burst with straining of my courage and from my shoulders crack my arms asunder but i will chastise this high minded strumpet my thoughts are whirl\u00e8d like a potter's wheel i know not where i am nor what i do a witch by fear not force like hannibal  drives back our troops and conquers as she lists so bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench are from their hives and houses driven away they called us for our fierceness english dogs now like to whelps we crying run away hark countrymen either renew the fight or tear the lions out of england's coat renounce your soil give sheep in lions' stead sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf or horse or oxen from the leopard as you fly from your oft subdu\u00e8d slaves it will not be retire into your trenches you all consented unto salisbury's death for none would strike a stroke in his revenge pucelle is entered into orleance in spite of us or aught that we could do o would i were to die with salisbury the shame hereof will make me hide my head lord regent and redoubted burgundy by whose approach the regions of artois walloon and picardy are friends to us this happy night the frenchmen are secure having all day caroused and banqueted embrace we then this opportunity as fitting best to quittance their deceit contrived by art and baleful sorcery a maid they say well let them practice and converse with spirits god is our fortress in whose conquering name let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks not all together better far i guess that we do make our entrance several ways that if it chance the one of us do fail the other yet may rise against their force and here will talbot mount or make his grave now salisbury for thee and for the right of english henry shall this night appear how much in duty i am bound to both bring forth the body of old salisbury and here advance it in the marketplace the middle center of this curs\u00e8d town now have i paid my vow unto his soul for every drop of blood was drawn from him there hath at least five frenchmen died tonight and that hereafter ages may behold what ruin happened in revenge of him within their chiefest temple i'll erect a tomb wherein his corpse shall be interred upon the which that everyone may read shall be engraved the sack of orleance the treacherous manner of his mournful death and what a terror he had been to france but lords in all our bloody massacre i muse we met not with the dauphin's grace his new come champion virtuous joan of arc nor any of his false confederates here is the talbot who would speak with him ne'er trust me then for when a world of men could not prevail with all their oratory yet hath a woman's kindness overruled  and therefore tell her i return great thanks and in submission will attend on her  will not your honors bear me company well then alone since there's no remedy i mean to prove this lady's courtesy  come hither captain you perceive my mind madam i have been bold to trouble you but since your ladyship is not at leisure i'll sort some other time to visit you marry for that she's in a wrong belief i go to certify her talbot's here prisoner to whom ha ha ha i laugh to see your ladyship so fond to think that you have aught but talbot's shadow whereon to practice your severity i am indeed no no i am but shadow of myself you are deceived my substance is not here for what you see is but the smallest part and least proportion of humanity i tell you madam were the whole frame here it is of such a spacious lofty pitch your roof were not sufficient to contain 't that will i show you presently how say you madam are you now persuaded that talbot is but shadow of himself these are his substance sinews arms and strength with which he yoketh your rebellious necks razeth your cities and subverts your towns and in a moment makes them desolate be not dismayed fair lady nor misconster the mind of talbot as you did mistake the outward composition of his body what you have done hath not offended me nor other satisfaction do i crave but only with your patience that we may taste of your wine and see what cates you have for soldiers' stomachs always serve them well france thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears if talbot but survive thy treachery pucelle that witch that damn\u00e8d sorceress hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares that hardly we escaped the pride of france foul fiend of france and hag of all despite encompassed with thy lustful paramours becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age and twit with cowardice a man half dead damsel i'll have a bout with you again or else let talbot perish with this shame dare you come forth and meet us in the field i speak not to that railing hecate but unto thee alanson and the rest will you like soldiers come and fight it out seigneur hang base muleteers of france like peasant footboys do they keep the walls and dare not take up arms like gentlemen and there will we be too ere it be long or else reproach be talbot's greatest fame  vow burgundy by honor of thy house pricked on by public wrongs sustained in france either to get the town again or die and i as sure as english henry lives and as his father here was conqueror as sure as in this late betray\u00e8d town great coeur de lion's heart was buri\u00e8d so sure i swear to get the town or die but ere we go regard this dying prince the valiant duke of bedford come my lord we will bestow you in some better place fitter for sickness and for crazy age undaunted spirit in a dying breast then be it so heavens keep old bedford safe  and now no more ado brave burgundy but gather we our forces out of hand and set upon our boasting enemy lost and recovered in a day again this is a double honor burgundy yet heavens have glory for this victory thanks gentle duke but where is pucelle now i think her old familiar is asleep now where's the bastard's braves and charles his gleeks what all amort roan hangs her head for grief that such a valiant company are fled now will we take some order in the town placing therein some expert officers and then depart to paris to the king for there young henry with his nobles lie but yet before we go let's not forget the noble duke of bedford late deceased but see his exequies fulfilled in roan a braver soldier never couch\u00e8d lance a gentler heart did never sway in court but kings and mightiest potentates must die for that's the end of human misery my gracious prince and honorable peers hearing of your arrival in this realm i have awhile given truce unto my wars to do my duty to my sovereign in sign whereof this arm that hath reclaimed to your obedience fifty fortresses twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength besides five hundred prisoners of esteem lets fall his sword before your highness' feet and with submissive loyalty of heart ascribes the glory of his conquest got first to my god and next unto your grace shame to the duke of burgundy and thee i vowed base knight when i did meet thee next to tear the garter from thy craven's leg which i have done because unworthily thou wast install\u00e8d in that high degree  pardon me princely henry and the rest this dastard at the battle of patay when but in all i was six thousand strong and that the french were almost ten to one before we met or that a stroke was given like to a trusty squire did run away in which assault we lost twelve hundred men myself and divers gentlemen besides were there surprised and taken prisoners then judge great lords if i have done amiss or whether that such cowards ought to wear this ornament of knighthood yea or no when first this order was ordained my lords knights of the garter were of noble birth valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage such as were grown to credit by the wars not fearing death nor shrinking for distress but always resolute in most extremes he then that is not furnished in this sort doth but usurp the sacred name of knight profaning this most honorable order and should if i were worthy to be judge be quite degraded like a hedge born swain that doth presume to boast of gentle blood content my liege yes but that i am prevented i should have begged i might have been employed i go my lord in heart desiring still you may behold confusion of your foes go to the gates of bordeaux trumpeter summon their general unto the wall english john talbot captains calls you forth servant in arms to harry king of england and thus he would open your city gates be humble to us call my sovereign yours and do him homage as obedient subjects and i'll withdraw me and my bloody power but if you frown upon this proffered peace you tempt

your grace bonjour the hunt is up the moon is bright and gray the fields are fragrant and the woods are green uncouple here and let us make a bay and wake the emperor and his lovely bride and rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal that all the court may echo with the noise sons let it be your charge as it is ours to attend the emperor's person carefully i have been troubled in my sleep this night but dawning day new comfort hath inspired many good morrows to your majesty  madam to you as many and as good  i promis\u00e8d your grace a hunter's peal and i have horse will follow where the game makes way and runs like swallows o'er the plain high emperor upon my feeble knee i beg this boon with tears not lightly shed that this fell fault of my accurs\u00e8d sons  accurs\u00e8d if the faults be proved in them  i did my lord yet let me be their bail for by my father's reverend tomb i vow they shall be ready at your highness' will to answer their suspicion with their lives come lucius come stay not to talk with them hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay for pity of mine age whose youth was spent in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept for all my blood in rome's great quarrel shed for all the frosty nights that i have watched and for these bitter tears which now you see filling the ag\u00e8d wrinkles in my cheeks be pitiful to my condemn\u00e8d sons whose souls is not corrupted as 'tis thought for two and twenty sons i never wept because they died in honor's lofty bed for these tribunes in the dust i write my heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite my sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush o earth i will befriend thee more with rain that shall distil from these two ancient ruins than youthful april shall with all his showers in summer's drought i'll drop upon thee still in winter with warm tears i'll melt the snow and keep eternal springtime on thy face so thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood o reverend tribunes o gentle ag\u00e8d men unbind my sons reverse the doom of death and let me say that never wept before my tears are now prevailing orators ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead  grave tribunes once more i entreat of you  why 'tis no matter man if they did hear they would not mark me if they did mark they would not pity me yet plead i must and bootless unto them therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones who though they cannot answer my distress yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes for that they will not intercept my tale when i do weep they humbly at my feet receive my tears and seem to weep with me and were they but attir\u00e8d in grave weeds rome could afford no tribunes like to these a stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones a stone is silent and offendeth not and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death but wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn o happy man they have befriended thee why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive that rome is but a wilderness of tigers tigers must prey and rome affords no prey but me and mine how happy art thou then from these devourers to be banish\u00e8d but who comes with our brother marcus here will it consume me let me see it then why marcus so she is faint hearted boy arise and look upon her  speak lavinia what accurs\u00e8d hand hath made thee handless in thy father's sight what fool hath added water to the sea or brought a faggot to bright burning troy my grief was at the height before thou cam'st and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds  give me a sword i'll chop off my hands too for they have fought for rome and all in vain and they have nursed this woe in feeding life in bootless prayer have they been held up and they have served me to effectless use now all the service i require of them is that the one will help to cut the other  'tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands for hands to do rome service is but vain it was my dear and he that wounded her hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead for now i stand as one upon a rock environed with a wilderness of sea who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave expecting ever when some envious surge will in his brinish bowels swallow him this way to death my wretched sons are gone here stands my other son a banished man and here my brother weeping at my woes but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn is dear lavinia dearer than my soul had i but seen thy picture in this plight it would have madded me what shall i do now i behold thy lively body so thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears nor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee thy husband he is dead and for his death thy brothers are condemned and dead by this  look marcus ah son lucius look on her when i did name her brothers then fresh tears stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew upon a gathered lily almost withered if they did kill thy husband then be joyful because the law hath ta'en revenge on them  no no they would not do so foul a deed witness the sorrow that their sister makes  gentle lavinia let me kiss thy lips or make some sign how i may do thee ease shall thy good uncle and thy brother lucius and thou and i sit round about some fountain looking all downwards to behold our cheeks how they are stained like meadows yet not dry with miry slime left on them by a flood and in the fountain shall we gaze so long till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness and made a brine pit with our bitter tears or shall we cut away our hands like thine or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows pass the remainder of our hateful days what shall we do let us that have our tongues plot some device of further misery to make us wondered at in time to come ah marcus marcus brother well i wot thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine for thou poor man hast drowned it with thine own mark marcus mark i understand her signs had she a tongue to speak now would she say that to her brother which i said to thee his napkin with his true tears all bewet can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks o what a sympathy of woe is this as far from help as limbo is from bliss o gracious emperor o gentle aaron did ever raven sing so like a lark that gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise with all my heart i'll send the emperor my hand good aaron wilt thou help to chop it off sirs strive no more such withered herbs as these are meet for plucking up and therefore mine agree between you i will spare my hand come hither aaron i'll deceive them both lend me thy hand and i will give thee mine now stay your strife what shall be is dispatched  good aaron give his majesty my hand tell him it was a hand that warded him from thousand dangers bid him bury it more hath it merited that let it have as for my sons say i account of them as jewels purchased at an easy price and yet dear too because i bought mine own o here i lift this one hand up to heaven and bow this feeble ruin to the earth if any power pities wretched tears to that i call what wouldst thou kneel with me do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim and stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds when they do hug him in their melting bosoms is not my sorrow deep having no bottom then be my passions bottomless with them if there were reason for these miseries then into limits could i bind my woes when heaven doth weep doth not the earth o'erflow if the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad threat'ning the welkin with his big swoll'n face and wilt thou have a reason for this coil i am the sea hark how her sighs doth flow she is the weeping welkin i the earth then must my sea be mov\u00e8d with her sighs then must my earth with her continual tears become a deluge overflowed and drowned forwhy my bowels cannot hide her woes but like a drunkard must i vomit them then give me leave for losers will have leave to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues when will this fearful slumber have an end ha ha ha why i have not another tear to shed besides this sorrow is an enemy and would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes and make them blind with tributary tears then which way shall i find revenge's cave for these two heads do seem to speak to me and threat me i shall never come to bliss till all these mischiefs be returned again even in their throats that hath committed them come let me see what task i have to do you heavy people circle me about that i may turn me to each one of you and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs the vow is made come brother take a head and in this hand the other will i bear  and lavinia thou shalt be employed in these arms bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth  as for thee boy go get thee from my sight thou art an exile and thou must not stay hie to the goths and raise an army there and if you love me as i think you do let's kiss and part for we have much to do so so now sit and look you eat no more than will preserve just so much strength in us as will revenge these bitter woes of ours marcus unknit that sorrow wreathen knot thy niece and i poor creatures want our hands and cannot passionate our tenfold grief with folded arms this poor right hand of mine is left to tyrannize upon my breast who when my heart all mad with misery beats in this hollow prison of my flesh then thus i thump it down  thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating thou canst not strike it thus to make it still wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans or get some little knife between thy teeth and just against thy heart make thou a hole that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall may run into that sink and soaking in drown the lamenting fool in sea salt tears how now has sorrow made thee dote already why marcus no man should be mad but i what violent hands can she lay on her life ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands to bid aeneas tell the tale twice o'er how troy was burnt and he made miserable o handle not the theme to talk of hands lest we remember still that we have none  fie fie how franticly i square my talk as if we should forget we had no hands if marcus did not name the word of hands come let's fall to and gentle girl eat this here is no drink hark marcus what she says i can interpret all her martyred signs she says she drinks no other drink but tears brewed with her sorrow mashed upon her cheeks  speechless complainer i will learn thy thought in thy dumb action will i be as perfect as begging hermits in their holy prayers thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign but i of these will wrest an alphabet and by still practice learn to know thy meaning peace tender sapling thou art made of tears and tears will quickly melt thy life away what dost thou strike at marcus with thy knife out on thee murderer thou kill'st my heart mine eyes are cloyed with view of tyranny a deed of death done on the innocent becomes not titus' brother get thee gone i see thou art not for my company but how if that fly had a father and mother how would he hang his slender gilded wings and buzz lamenting doings in the air poor harmless fly that with his pretty buzzing melody came here to make us merry and thou hast killed him o o o then pardon me for reprehending thee for thou hast done a charitable deed give me thy knife i will insult on him flattering myself as if it were the moor come hither purposely to poison me there's for thyself and that's for tamora ah sirrah yet i think we are not brought so low but that between us we can kill a fly that comes in likeness of a coal black moor come take away lavinia go with me i'll to thy closet and go read with thee sad stories

mine alderliefest sovereign makes me the bolder to salute my king with ruder terms such as my wit affords and overjoy of heart doth minister we thank you all to my lord protector are your supplications to his lordship let me see them what is thine what sayst thou did the duke of york say he was rightful heir to the crown and as for you that love to be protected under the wings of our protector's grace begin your suits anew and sue to him away base cullions suffolk let them go my lord of suffolk say is this the guise is this the fashions in the court of england is this the government of britain's isle and this the royalty of albion's king what shall king henry be a pupil still under the surly gloucester's governance am i a queen in title and in style and must be made a subject to a duke i tell thee pole when in the city tours thou rann'st atilt in honor of my love and stol'st away the ladies' hearts of france i thought king henry had resembled thee in courage courtship and proportion but all his mind is bent to holiness to number ave marys on his beads his champions are the prophets and apostles his weapons holy saws of sacred writ his study is his tiltyard and his loves are brazen images of canonized saints i would the college of the cardinals would choose him pope and carry him to rome and set the triple crown upon his head that were a state fit for his holiness besides the haughty protector have we beaufort the imperious churchman somerset buckingham and grumbling york and not the least of these but can do more in england than the king not all these lords do vex me half so much as that proud dame the lord protector's wife she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies more like an empress than duke humphrey's wife strangers in court do take her for the queen she bears a duke's revenues on her back and in her heart she scorns our poverty shall i not live to be avenged on her contemptuous baseborn callet as she is she vaunted 'mongst her minions t' other day the very train of her worst wearing gown was better worth than all my father's lands till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter because the king forsooth will have it so if he be old enough what needs your grace to be protector of his excellence thy sale of offices and towns in france if they were known as the suspect is great would make thee quickly hop without thy head give me my fan what minion can you not i cry you mercy madam was it you believe me lords for flying at the brook i saw not better sport these seven years' day yet by your leave the wind was very high and ten to one old joan had not gone out and thy ambition gloucester tell me good fellow cam'st thou here by chance or of devotion to this holy shrine it made me laugh to see the villain run gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest and look thyself be faultless thou wert best i see no reason why a king of years should be to be protected like a child god and king henry govern england's realm  give up your staff sir and the king his realm why now is henry king and margaret queen and humphrey duke of gloucester scarce himself that bears so shrewd a maim two pulls at once his lady banished and a limb lopped off this staff of honor raught there let it stand where it best fits to be in henry's hand ay good my lord for purposely therefor left i the court to see this quarrel tried can you not see or will you not observe the strangeness of his altered countenance with what a majesty he bears himself how insolent of late he is become how proud how peremptory and unlike himself we know the time since he was mild and affable and if we did but glance a far off look immediately he was upon his knee that all the court admired him for submission but meet him now and be it in the morn when everyone will give the time of day he knits his brow and shows an angry eye and passeth by with stiff unbow\u00e8d knee disdaining duty that to us belongs small curs are not regarded when they grin but great men tremble when the lion roars  and humphrey is no little man in england first note that he is near you in descent and should you fall he is the next will mount meseemeth then it is no policy respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness' council by flattery hath he won the commons' hearts and when he please to make commotion 'tis to be feared they all will follow him now 'tis the spring and weeds are shallow rooted suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden and choke the herbs for want of husbandry the reverent care i bear unto my lord made me collect these dangers in the duke if it be fond call it a woman's fear which fear if better reasons can supplant i will subscribe and say i wronged the duke my lords of suffolk buckingham and york reprove my allegation if you can or else conclude my words effectual ah what's more dangerous than this fond affiance seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed for he's dispos\u00e8d as the hateful raven is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him for he's inclined as is the ravenous wolves who cannot steal a shape that means deceit take heed my lord the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man but i can give the loser leave to chide what will your highness leave the parliament free lords cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams henry my lord is cold in great affairs too full of foolish pity and gloucester's show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers or as the snake rolled in a flow'ring bank with shining checkered slough doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent believe me lords were none more wise than i  and yet herein i judge mine own wit good  this gloucester should be quickly rid the world to rid us from the fear we have of him so the poor chicken should be sure of death thrice noble suffolk 'tis resolutely spoke and so say i nay then this spark will prove a raging fire if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with  no more good york sweet somerset be still  thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there might happily have proved far worse than his god forbid any malice should prevail that faultless may condemn a nobleman pray god he may acquit him of suspicion marry god forfend how fares my lord help lords the king is dead run go help help o henry ope thine eyes how fares my gracious lord why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus although the duke was enemy to him yet he most christian like laments his death and for myself foe as he was to me might liquid tears or heart offending groans or blood consuming sighs recall his life i would be blind with weeping sick with groans look pale as primrose with blood drinking sighs and all to have the noble duke alive what know i how the world may deem of me for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judged i made the duke away so shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded and princes' courts be filled with my reproach this get i by his death ay me unhappy to be a queen and crowned with infamy be woe for me more wretched than he is what dost thou turn away and hide thy face i am no loathsome leper look on me what art thou like the adder waxen deaf be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen is all thy comfort shut in gloucester's tomb why then dame margaret was ne'er thy joy erect his statue and worship it and make my image but an alehouse sign was i for this nigh wracked upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from england's bank drove back again unto my native clime what boded this but well forewarning wind did seem to say seek not a scorpion's nest nor set no footing on this unkind shore what did i then but cursed the gentle gusts and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards england's bless\u00e8d shore or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock yet aeolus would not be a murderer but left that hateful office unto thee the pretty vaulting sea refused to drown me knowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shore with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cow'red in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides because thy flinty heart more hard than they might in thy palace perish margaret as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs when from thy shore the tempest beat us back i stood upon the hatches in the storm and when the dusky sky began to rob my earnest gaping sight of thy land's view i took a costly jewel from my neck  a heart it was bound in with diamonds  and threw it towards thy land the sea received it and so i wished thy body might my heart and even with this i lost fair england's view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and called them blind and dusky spectacles for losing ken of albion's wish\u00e8d coast how often have i tempted suffolk's tongue the agent of thy foul inconstancy to sit and watch me as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his father's acts commenced in burning troy am i not witched like her or thou not false like him ay me i can no more die margaret for henry weeps that thou dost live so long then you belike suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphrey's timeless death are you the butcher suffolk where's your knife is beaufort termed a kite where are his talons he dares not calm his contumelious spirit nor cease to be an arrogant controller though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times what noise is this o henry let me plead for gentle suffolk mischance and sorrow go along with you heart's discontent and sour affliction be playfellows to keep you company there's two of you the devil make a third and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps fie coward woman and soft hearted wretch hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemies enough sweet suffolk thou torment'st thyself and these dread curses like the sun 'gainst glass or like an over charg\u00e8d gun recoil and turn the force of them upon thyself o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand that i may dew it with my mournful tears nor let the rain of heaven wet this place to wash away my woeful monuments o could this kiss be printed in thy hand that thou mightst think upon these by the seal through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee so get thee gone that i may know my grief 'tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by as one that surfeits thinking on a want i will repeal thee or be well assured adventure to be banish\u00e8d myself and banish\u00e8d i am if but from thee go speak not to me even now be gone o go not yet even thus two friends condemned embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves loather a hundred times to part than die yet now farewell and farewell life with thee whither goes vaux so fast what news i prithee go tell this heavy message to the king ay me what is this world what news are these but wherefore grieve i at an hour's poor loss omitting suffolk's exile my soul's treasure why only suffolk mourn i not for thee and with the southern clouds contend in tears  theirs for the earth's increase mine for my sorrows' now get thee hence the king thou know'st is coming if thou be found by me thou art but dead away though parting be a fretful corrosive it is appli\u00e8d to a deathful wound to france sweet suffolk let me hear from thee for wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe i'll have an iris that shall find thee out and take my heart with thee this way for me oft have i heard that grief softens the mind and makes it fearful and degenerate think therefore on revenge and cease to weep but who can cease to weep and look on this here may his head lie on my throbbing breast but where's the body that i should embrace ah barbarous villains hath this lovely face ruled like a wandering planet over me and could it not enforce them to relent that were unworthy to behold the same no my love i should not mourn but die for thee ah were the duke of suffolk now alive these kentish rebels would be soon appeased my hope is gone now suffolk is deceased for thousand yorks he shall not hide his head but boldly stand and front him to his face call hither clifford bid him come amain to say if that the bastard boys of york shall be the surety for their traitor father and here comes clifford to deny their bail he is arrested but will not obey his sons he says shall give their words for him a subtle traitor needs no sophister away my lord you are slow for shame away what are you made of you'll nor fight nor fly now is it manhood wisdom and defense to give the enemy way and to secure us by what we can which can no more but fly if you be ta'en we then should see the bottom of all our

love have you wearied your parishioners withal and never cried have patience good people o yes i heard them all and more too for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear ay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came for look here what i found on a palm tree i was never so berhymed since pythagoras' time that i was an irish rat which i can hardly remember is it a man i prithee who nay but who is it nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it is good my complexion dost thou think though i am caparisoned like a man i have a doublet and hose in my disposition one inch of delay more is a south sea of discovery i prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace i would thou couldst stammer that thou might'st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at all i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that i may drink thy tidings is he of god's making what manner of man is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard why god will send more if the man will be thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and true maid orlando alas the day what shall i do with my doublet and hose what did he when thou saw'st him what said he how looked he wherein went he what makes he here did he ask for me where remains he how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see him again answer me in one word but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man's apparel looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled it may well be called jove's tree when it drops forth such fruit proceed though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground o ominous he comes to kill my heart do you not know i am a woman when i think i must speak sweet say on 'tis he slink by and note him i will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him do you hear forester i pray you what is 't o'clock then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock by no means sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons i'll tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a se'nnight time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal there were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that fancy monger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him there is none of my uncle's marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation but you are no such man you are rather point device in your accouterments as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other me believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his love his mistress and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this color would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart that there shall not be one spot of love in 't i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me go with me to it and i'll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live will you go nay you must call me rosalind come sister will you go never talk to me i will weep but have i not cause to weep his very hair is of the dissembling color i' faith his hair is of a good color and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not do you think so not true in love you have heard him swear downright he was i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him he asked me of what parentage i was i told him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando o come let us remove the sight of lovers feedeth those in love bring us to this sight and you shall say i'll prove a busy actor in their play and why i pray you who might be your mother that you insult exult and all at once over the wretched what though you have no beauty  as by my faith i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed  must you be therefore proud and pitiless why what means this why do you look on me i see no more in you than in the ordinary of nature's sale work 'od's my little life i think she means to tangle my eyes too  no faith proud mistress hope not after it 'tis not your inky brows your black silk hair your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream that can entame my spirits to your worship  you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her like foggy south puffing with wind and rain you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman 'tis such fools as you that makes the world full of ill favored children 'tis not her glass but you that flatters her and

enough to consent what would you say to me now an i were your very very rosalind nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking god warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter marry that should you if i were your mistress or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit am not i your rosalind well in her person i say i will not have you no faith die by attorney the poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a love cause troilus had his brains dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love leander he would have lived many a fair year though hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was hero of sestos but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now i will be your rosalind in a more coming on disposition and ask me what you will i will grant it yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all ay and twenty such are you not good why then can one desire too much of a good thing come sister you shall be the priest and marry us give me your hand orlando what do you say sister you must begin will you orlando  ay but when then you must say i take thee rosalind for wife i might ask you for your commission but i do take thee orlando for my husband there's a girl goes before the priest and certainly a woman's thought runs before her actions now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her say a day without the ever no no orlando men are april when they woo december when they wed maids are may when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock pigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyena and that when thou art inclined to sleep by my life she will do as i do or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a woman's wit and it will out at the casement shut that and 'twill out at the keyhole stop that 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbor's bed marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue o that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and i thought no less that flattering tongue of yours won me 'tis but one cast away and so come death two o'clock is your hour by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour i will think you the most pathetical break promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep your promise well time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try adieu o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love but it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of portugal no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone's eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep i am in love i'll tell thee aliena i cannot be out of the sight of orlando i'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come how say you now is it not past two o'clock and here much orlando patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer bear this bear all she says i am not fair that i lack manners she calls me proud and that she could not love me were man as rare as phoenix 'od's my will her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me well shepherd well this is a letter of your own device come come you are a fool and turned into the extremity of love i saw her hand she has a leathern hand a freestone colored hand i verily did think that her old gloves were on but 'twas her hands she has a huswife's hand but that's no matter i say she never did invent this letter this is a man's invention and his hand why 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style a style for challengers why she defies me like turk to christian women's gentle brain could not drop forth such giant rude invention such ethiop words blacker in their effect than in their countenance will you hear the letter she phoebes me mark how the tyrant writes art thou god to shepherd turned that a maiden's heart hath burned can a woman rail thus why thy godhead laid apart warr'st thou with a woman's heart did you ever hear such railing whiles the eye of man did woo me that could do no vengeance to me meaning me a beast if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine alack in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect whiles you chid me i did love how then might your prayers move he that brings this love to thee little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make or else by him my love deny and then i'll study how to die do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt thou love such a woman what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee not to be endured well go your way to her for i see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her that if she love me i charge her to love thee if she will not i will never have her unless thou entreat for her if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company i am what must we understand by this but to orlando did he leave him there food to the sucked and hungry lioness was 't you he rescued but for the bloody napkin i would i were at home i do so i confess it ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited i pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited heigh ho counterfeit i assure you so i do but i' faith i should have been a woman by right i shall devise something but i pray you commend my counterfeiting to him will you go god save you brother o my dear orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkercher o i know where you are nay 'tis true there was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesar's thrasonical brag of i came saw and overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked no sooner looked but they loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage they are in the very wrath of love and they will together clubs cannot part them why then tomorrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind i will weary you then no longer with idle talking know of me then for now i speak to some purpose that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch i say i know you are neither do i labor for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me believe then if you please that i can do strange things i have since i was three year old conversed with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her i know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger by my life i do which i tender dearly though i say i am a magician therefore put you in your best array bid your friends for if you will be married tomorrow you shall and to rosalind if you will look here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers i care not if i have it is my study to seem despiteful and ungentle to you you are there followed by a faithful shepherd look upon him love him he worships you and i for no woman and i for no woman and so am i for no woman why do you speak too why blame you me to love you pray you no more of this 'tis like the howling of irish wolves against the moon i will help you if i can i would love you if i could tomorrow meet me all together i will marry you if ever i marry woman and i'll be married tomorrow i will satisfy you if ever i satisfy man and you shall be married tomorrow i will content you if what pleases you contents you and you shall be married tomorrow as you love rosalind meet as you love phoebe meet and as i love no woman i'll meet so fare you well i have left you commands patience once more whiles our compact is urged you say if i bring in your rosalind you will bestow her on orlando here and you say you will have her when i bring her you say you'll marry me if i be willing but if you do refuse to marry me you'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd you say that you'll have phoebe if she will i have promised to make all this matter even keep you your word o duke to give your daughter  you yours orlando to receive his daughter  keep you your word phoebe that you'll marry me or else refusing me to wed this shepherd  keep your word silvius that you'll marry her if she refuse me and from hence i go to make these doubts all even to you i give myself for i am yours to you i give myself for i am yours i'll have no father if you be not he i'll have no husband if you be not he nor ne'er wed woman if you be not she it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue if it be true that good wine needs no bush 'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues what a case am i in then that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play i am not furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me my way is to conjure you and i'll begin with the women i charge you o women for the love you bear to men to like as much of this play as please you and i charge you o men for the love you bear to women as i perceive by your simpering none of you hates them that between you and the women the play may please if i were a woman i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me complexions that liked me and breaths that i defied not and i am sure as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when i make curtsy bid me farewell", "MM_Isabella": "and have you nuns no farther privileges yes truly i speak not as desiring more but rather wishing a more strict restraint upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare

me not your story you do blaspheme the good in mocking me someone with child by him my cousin juliet adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names by vain though apt affection o let him marry her doth he so seek his life alas what poor ability's in me to do him good my power alas i doubt  i'll see what i can do i will about it straight no longer staying but to give the mother notice of my affair i humbly thank you commend me to my brother soon at night i'll send him certain word of my success good sir adieu i am a woeful suitor to your honor please but your honor hear me there is a vice that most i do abhor and most desire should meet the blow of justice for which i would not plead but that i must for which i must not plead but that i am at war 'twixt will and will not i have a brother is condemned to die i do beseech you let it be his fault and not my brother o just but severe law i had a brother then heaven keep your honor must he needs die yes i do think that you might pardon him and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy but can you if you would but might you do 't and do the world no wrong if so your heart were touched with that remorse as mine is to him too late why no i that do speak a word may call it back again well believe this no ceremony that to great ones longs not the king's crown nor the deputed sword the marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe become them

my lord bethink you who is it that hath died for this offense there's many have committed it yet show some pity so you must be the first that gives this sentence and he that suffers o it is excellent to have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would never be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder merciful heaven thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt splits the unwedgeable and gnarl\u00e8d oak than the soft myrtle but man proud man dressed in a little brief authority most ignorant of what he's most assured his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as makes the angels weep who with our spleens would all themselves laugh mortal we cannot weigh our brother with ourself great men may jest with saints 'tis wit in them but in the less foul profanation that in the captain's but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy because authority though it err like others hath yet a kind of medicine in itself that skins the vice o' th' top go to your bosom knock there and ask your heart what it doth know that's

lord turn back ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you not with fond sicles of the tested gold or stones whose rate are either rich or poor as fancy values them but with true prayers that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere sunrise prayers from preserv\u00e8d souls from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal heaven keep your honor safe at what hour tomorrow

fitted that his soul sicken not 'tis set down so in heaven but not in earth sir believe this i had rather give my body than my soul how say you please you to do 't i'll take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all but charity that i do beg his life if it be sin heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit if that be sin i'll make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine and nothing of your answer let me be ignorant and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better so true as much for my poor brother as myself that is were i under the terms of death th' impression of keen whips i'd wear as rubies and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for ere i'd yield my body up to shame and 'twere the cheaper way better it were a brother died at once than that a sister by redeeming him should die forever ignomy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption o pardon me my lord it oft falls out to have what we would have we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love else let my brother die if not a fedary but only he owe and succeed thy weakness ay as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make forms women help heaven men their creation mar in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexions are and credulous to false prints i have no tongue but one gentle my lord let me entreat you speak the former language my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for 't i know your virtue hath a license in 't which seems a little fouler than it is to pluck on others ha little honor to be much believed and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming i will proclaim thee angelo look for 't sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretched throat i'll tell the world aloud what man thou art to whom should i complain did i tell this who would believe me o perilous mouths that bear in them one and the selfsame tongue either of condemnation or approof bidding the law make curtsy to their will hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite to follow as it draws i'll to my brother though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood yet hath he in him such a mind of honor that had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks he'd yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorred pollution then isabel live chaste and brother die more than our brother is our chastity i'll tell him yet of angelo's request and fit his mind to death for his soul's rest what ho peace here grace and good company my business is a word or two with claudio why as all comforts are most good most good indeed lord angelo having affairs to heaven intends you for his swift ambassador where you shall be an everlasting leiger therefore your best appointment make with speed tomorrow you set on none but such remedy as to save a head to cleave a heart in twain yes brother you may live there is a devilish mercy in the judge if you'll implore it that will free your life but fetter you till death ay just perpetual durance a restraint though all the world's vastidity you had to a determined scope in such a one as you consenting to 't would bark your honor from that trunk you bear and leave you naked o i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honor dar'st thou die the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies there spake my brother there my father's grave did utter forth a voice yes thou must die thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances this outward sainted deputy  whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i' th' head and follies doth enew as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil his filth within being cast he would appear a pond as deep as hell o 'tis the cunning livery of hell the damned'st body to invest and cover in prenzie guards dost thou think claudio if i would yield him my virginity thou mightst be freed yes he would give 't thee from this rank offense so to offend him still this night's the time that i should do what i abhor to name or else thou diest tomorrow o were it but my life i'd throw it down for your deliverance as frankly as a pin be ready claudio for your death tomorrow which is the least what says my brother and sham\u00e8d life a hateful alas alas o you beast o faithless coward o dishonest wretch wilt thou be made a man out of my vice is 't not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sister's shame what should i think heaven shield my mother played my father fair for such a warp\u00e8d slip of wilderness ne'er issued from his blood take my defiance die perish might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed i'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death no word to save thee o fie fie fie thy sin's not accidental but a trade mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd 'tis best that thou diest quickly what is your will i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile i am now going to resolve him i had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born but o how much is the good duke deceived in angelo if ever he return and i can speak to him i will open my lips in vain or discover his government let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name can this be so did angelo so leave her what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world what corruption in this life that it will let this man live but how out of this can she avail show me how good father the image of it gives me content already and i trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection i thank you for this comfort fare you well good father he hath a garden circummured with brick whose western side is with a vineyard backed and to that vineyard is a planch\u00e8d gate that makes his opening with this bigger key this other doth command a little door which from the vineyard to the garden leads there have i made my promise upon the heavy middle of the night to call upon him i have ta'en a due and wary note upon 't with whispering and most guilty diligence in action all of precept he did show me the way twice o'er no none but only a repair i' th' dark and that i have possessed him my most stay can be but brief for i have made him know i have a servant comes with me along that stays upon me whose persuasion is i come about my brother i do desire the like she'll take the enterprise upon her father if you advise it little have you to say when you depart from him but soft and low remember now my brother peace ho be here ho by your leave the better given me by so holy a man hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon nay but it is not so o i will to him and pluck out his eyes unhappy claudio wretched isabel injurious world most damn\u00e8d angelo i am directed by you to speak so indirectly i am loath i would say the truth but to accuse him so that is your part yet i am advised to do it he says to veil full purpose besides he tells me that if peradventure he speak against me on the adverse side i should not think it strange for 'tis a physic that's bitter to sweet end o peace the friar is come justice o royal duke vail your regard upon a wronged i would fain have said a maid o worthy prince dishonor not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and given me justice justice justice justice o worthy duke you bid me seek redemption of the devil hear me yourself for that which i must speak must either punish me not being believed or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here by course of justice most strange but yet most truly will i speak that angelo's forsworn is it not strange that angelo's a murderer is 't not strange that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite a virgin violator is it not strange and strange it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange nay it is ten times true for truth is truth to th' end of reck'ning o prince i conjure thee as thou believest there is another comfort than this world that thou neglect me not with that opinion that i am touched with madness make not impossible that which but seems unlike 'tis not impossible but one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute as angelo even so may angelo in all his dressings caracts titles forms be an archvillain believe it royal prince if he be less he's nothing but he's more had i more name for badness o gracious duke harp not on that nor do not banish reason for inequality but let your reason serve to make the truth appear where it seems hid and hide the false seems true i am the sister of one claudio condemned upon the act of fornication to lose his head condemned by angelo i in probation of a sisterhood was sent to by my brother one lucio as then the messenger  that's he indeed this gentleman told somewhat of my tale i went to this pernicious caitiff deputy  pardon it the phrase is to the matter in brief to set the needless process by how i persuaded how i prayed and kneeled how he refelled me and how i replied  for this was of much length the vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter he would not but by gift of my chaste body to his concupiscible intemperate lust release my brother and after much debatement my sisterly remorse confutes mine honor and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant for my poor brother's head o that it were as like as it is true and is this all then o you bless\u00e8d ministers above keep me in patience and with ripened time unfold the evil which is here wrapped up in countenance heaven shield your grace from woe as i thus wronged hence unbeliev\u00e8d go one that i would were here friar lodowick o give me pardon that i your vassal have employed and pained your unknown sovereignty i do my lord most bounteous sir look if it please you on this man condemned as if my brother lived i partly think a due sincerity governed his deeds till he did look on me since it is so let him not die my brother had but justice in that he did the thing for which he died for angelo his act did not o'ertake his bad intent and must be buried but as an intent that perished by the way thoughts are no subjects intents but merely thoughts", "TNK_Daughter": "these strewings are for their chamber 'tis pity they are in prison and 'twere pity they should be out i do think they have patience to make any adversity ashamed the prison itself is proud of 'em and they have all the world in their chamber by my troth i think fame but stammers 'em they stand a grise above the reach of report nay most likely for they are noble suff'rers i marvel how they would have looked had they been victors that with such a constant nobility enforce a freedom out of bondage making misery their mirth and affliction a toy to jest at it seems to me they have no more sense of their captivity than i of ruling athens they eat well look merrily discourse of many things but nothing of their own restraint and disasters yet sometimes a divided sigh martyred as 'twere i' th' deliverance will break from one of them when the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that i could wish myself a sigh to be so chid or at least a sigher to be comforted no sir no that's palamon arcite is the lower of the twain you may perceive a part of him it is a holiday to look on them lord the diff'rence of men why should i love this gentleman 'tis odds he never will affect me i am base my father the mean keeper of his prison and he a prince to marry him is hopeless to be his whore is witless out upon 't what pushes are we wenches driven to when fifteen once has found us first i saw him i seeing thought he was a goodly man he has as much to please a woman in him if he please to bestow it so as ever these eyes yet looked on next i pitied him and so would any young wench o' my conscience that ever dreamed or vowed her maidenhead to a young handsome man then i loved him extremely loved him infinitely loved him and yet he had a cousin fair as he too but in my heart was palamon and there lord what a coil he keeps to hear him sing in an evening what a heaven it is and yet his songs are sad ones fairer spoken was never gentleman when i come in to bring him water in a morning first he bows his noble body then salutes me thus fair gentle maid good morrow may thy goodness get thee a happy husband once he kissed me i loved my lips the better ten days after would he would do so ev'ry day he grieves much  and me as much to see his misery what should i do to make him know i love him for i would fain enjoy him say i ventured to set him free what says the law then thus much for law or kindred i will do it and this night or tomorrow he shall love me let all the dukes and all the devils roar he is at liberty i have ventured for him and out i have brought him to a little wood a mile hence i have sent him where a cedar higher than all the rest spreads like a plane fast by a brook and there he shall keep close till i provide him files and food for yet his iron bracelets are not off o love what a stout hearted child thou art my father durst better have endured cold iron than done it i love him beyond love and beyond reason or wit or safety i have made him know it i care not i am desperate if the law find me and then condemn me for 't some wenches some honest hearted maids will sing my dirge and tell to memory my death was noble dying almost a martyr that way he takes i purpose is my way too sure he cannot be so unmanly as to leave me here if he do maids will not so easily trust men again and yet he has not thanked me for what i have done no not so much as kissed me and that methinks is not so well nor scarcely could i persuade him to become a free man he made such scruples of the wrong he did to me and to my father yet i hope when he considers more this love of mine will take more root within him let him do what he will with me so he use me kindly for use me so he shall or i'll proclaim him and to his face no man i'll presently provide him necessaries and pack my clothes up and where there is a path of ground i'll venture so he be with me by him like a shadow i'll ever dwell within this hour the hubbub will be all o'er the prison i am then kissing the man they look for farewell father get many more such prisoners and such daughters and shortly you may keep yourself now to him he has mistook the brake i meant is gone after his fancy 'tis now well nigh morning no matter would it were perpetual night and darkness lord o' th' world hark 'tis a wolf in me hath grief slain fear and but for one thing i care for nothing and that's palamon i reck not if the wolves would jaw me so he had this file what if i hallowed for him i cannot hallow if i whooped what then if he not answered i should call a wolf and do him but that service i have heard strange howls this livelong night why may 't not be they have made prey of him he has no weapons he cannot run the jingling of his gyves might call fell things to listen who have in them a sense to know a man unarmed and can smell where resistance is i'll set it down he's torn to pieces they howled many together and then they fed on him so much for that be bold to ring the bell how stand i then all's chared when he is gone no no i lie my father's to be hanged for his escape myself to beg if i prized life so much as to deny my act but that i would not should i try death by dozens i am moped food took i none these two days sipped some water i have not closed mine eyes save when my lids scoured off their brine alas dissolve my life let not my sense unsettle lest i should drown or stab or

of this great world good sentences and well pronounced if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor men's cottages princes' palaces it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband o me the word choose i may neither choose who i would nor refuse who i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father is it not hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none i pray thee overname them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection ay that's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith he doth nothing but frown as who should say an you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be married to a death's head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these god defend me from these two god made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the neapolitan's a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a cap'ring he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english he is a proper man's picture but alas who can converse with a dumb show how oddly he is suited i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behavior everywhere that he hath a neighborly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast an the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it i will do anything nerissa ere i will be married to a sponge if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my father's will i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant them a fair departure yes yes it was bassanio as i think so was he called i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise how now what news if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me come nerissa sirrah go before  whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the door in terms of choice i am not solely led by nice direction of a maiden's eyes besides the lott'ry of my destiny bars me the right of voluntary choosing but if my father had not scanted me and hedged me by his wit to yield myself his wife who wins me by that means i told you yourself renown\u00e8d prince then stood as fair as any comer i have looked on yet for my affection you must take your chance and either not attempt to choose at all or swear before you choose if you choose wrong never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage therefore be advised first forward to the temple after dinner your hazard shall be made go draw aside the curtains and discover the several caskets to this noble prince now make your choice the one of them contains my picture prince if you choose that then i am yours withal there take it prince and if my form lie there then i am yours a gentle riddance draw the curtains go let all of his complexion choose me so behold there stand the caskets noble prince if you choose that wherein i am contained straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized but if you fail without more speech my lord you must be gone from hence immediately to these injunctions everyone doth swear that comes to hazard for my worthless self too long a pause for that which you find there to offend and judge are distinct offices and of oppos\u00e8d natures thus hath the candle singed the moth o these deliberate fools when they do choose they have the wisdom by their wit to lose come draw the curtain nerissa here what would my lord no more i pray thee i am half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee thou spend'st such high day wit in praising him come come nerissa for i long to see quick cupid's post that comes so mannerly i pray you tarry pause a day or two before you hazard for in choosing wrong i lose your company therefore forbear a while there's something tells me but it is not love i would not lose you and you know yourself hate counsels not in such a quality but lest you should not understand me well and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought i would detain you here some month or two before you venture for me i could teach you how to choose right but then i am forsworn so will i never be so may you miss me but if you do you'll make me wish a sin that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes they have o'erlooked me and divided me one half of me is yours the other half yours  mine own i would say but if mine then yours and so all yours o these naughty times puts bars between the owners and their rights and so though yours not yours prove it so let fortune go to hell for it not i i speak too long but 'tis to peize the time to eche it and to draw it out in length to stay you from election upon the rack bassanio then confess what treason there is mingled with your love ay but i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforc\u00e8d do speak anything well then confess and live away then i am locked in one of them if you do love me you will find me out  nerissa and the rest stand all aloof let music sound while he doth make his choice then if he lose he makes a swanlike end fading in music that the comparison may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream and wat'ry deathbed for him he may win and what is music then then music is even as the flourish when true subjects bow to a new crown\u00e8d monarch such it is as are those dulcet sounds in break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear and summon him to marriage now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the sea monster i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives with blear\u00e8d visages come forth to view the issue of th' exploit go hercules live thou i live with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that mak'st the fray how all the other passions fleet to air as doubtful thoughts and rash embraced despair and shudd'ring fear and green eyed jealousy o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rain thy joy scant this excess i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit you see me lord bassanio where i stand such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich that only to stand high in your account i might in virtues beauties livings friends exceed account but the full sum of me is sum of something which to term in gross is an unlessoned girl unschooled unpracticed happy in this she is not yet so old but she may learn happier than this she is not bred so dull but she can learn happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord her governor her king myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted but now i was the lord of this fair mansion master of my servants queen o'er myself and even now but now this house these servants and this same myself are yours my lord's i give them with this ring which when you part from lose or give away let it presage the ruin of your love and be my vantage to exclaim on you is this true nerissa so do i my lord they are entirely welcome there are some shrewd contents in yond same paper that steals the color from bassanio's cheek some dear friend dead else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man what worse and worse  with leave bassanio i am half yourself and i must freely have the half of anything that this same paper brings you is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble what sum owes he the jew what no more pay him six thousand and deface the bond double six thousand and then treble that before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through bassanio's fault first go with me to church and call me wife and then away to venice to your friend for never shall you lie by portia's side with an unquiet soul you shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over when it is paid bring your true friend along my maid nerissa and myself meantime will live as maids and widows come away for you shall hence upon your wedding day bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer since you are dear bought i will love you dear but let me hear the letter of your friend o love dispatch all business and begone i never did repent for doing good nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this antonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord if it be so how little is the cost i have bestowed in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish cruelty this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it hear other things lorenzo i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lord's return for mine own part i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by nerissa here until her husband and my lord's return there is a monastery two miles off and there we will abide i do desire you not to deny this imposition the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you my people do already know my mind and will acknowledge you and jessica in place of lord bassanio and myself so fare you well till we shall meet again i thank you for your wish and am well pleased to wish it back on you fare you well jessica now balthazar as i have ever found thee honest true so let me find thee still take this same letter and use thou all th' endeavor of a man in speed to padua see thou render this into my cousin's hands doctor bellario and look what notes and garments he doth give thee bring them i pray thee with imagined speed unto the traject to the common ferry which trades to venice waste no time in words but get thee gone i shall be there before thee come on nerissa i have work in hand that you yet know not of we'll see our husbands before they think of us they shall nerissa but in such a habit that they shall think we are accomplish\u00e8d with that we lack i'll hold thee any wager when we are both accoutered like young men i'll prove the prettier fellow of the two and wear my dagger with the braver grace and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honorable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died  i could not do withal then i'll repent and wish for all that that i had not killed them and twenty of these puny lies i'll tell that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practice fie what a question's that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter but come i'll tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach which stays for us at the park gate and therefore haste away for we must measure twenty miles today i did my lord i am inform\u00e8d throughly of the cause which is the merchant here and which the jew is your name shylock of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law cannot impugn you as you do proceed you stand within his danger do you not do you confess the bond then must the jew be merciful the quality of mercy is not strained it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes 'tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the thron\u00e8d monarch better than his crown his scepter shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptered sway it is enthron\u00e8d in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest god's when mercy seasons justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there is he not able to discharge the money it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree establish\u00e8d 'twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it cannot be i pray you let me look upon the bond shylock there's thrice thy money offered thee why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchant's heart be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife  for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond therefore lay bare your bosom  it is so are there balance here to weigh the flesh have by some surgeon shylock on your charge to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death it is not so expressed but what of that 'twere good you do so much for charity you merchant have you anything to say your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer a pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine the court awards it and the law doth give it and you must cut this flesh from off his breast the law allows it and the court awards it tarry a little there is something else this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood the words expressly are a pound of flesh take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice confiscate unto the state of venice thyself shalt see the act for as thou urgest justice be assured thou shalt have justice more than thou desir'st soft the jew shall have all justice soft no haste he shall have nothing but the penalty therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh if thou tak'st more or less than a just pound be it but so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate why doth the jew pause take thy forfeiture he hath refused it in the open court he shall have merely justice and his bond thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture to be so taken at thy peril jew tarry jew the law hath yet another hold on you it is enacted in the laws of venice if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen the party 'gainst the which he doth contrive shall seize one half his goods the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state and the offender's life lies in the mercy of the duke only 'gainst all other voice in which predicament i say thou stand'st for it appears by manifest proceeding that indirectly and directly too thou hast contrived against the very life of the defendant and thou hast incurred the danger formerly by me rehearsed down therefore and beg mercy of the duke ay for the state not for antonio what mercy can you render him antonio art thou contented jew what dost thou say clerk draw a deed of gift i humbly do desire your grace of pardon i must away this night toward padua and it is meet i presently set forth he is well paid that is well satisfied and i delivering you am satisfied and therein do account myself well paid my mind was never yet more mercenary i pray you know me when we meet again i wish you well and so i take my leave you press me far and therefore i will yield give me your gloves i'll wear them for your sake  and for your love i'll take this ring from you do not draw back your hand i'll take no more and you in love shall not deny me this i will have nothing else but only this and now methinks i have a mind to it i see sir you are liberal in offers you taught me first to beg and now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answered that 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts and if your wife be not a madwoman and know how well i have deserved this ring she would not hold out enemy forever for giving it to me well peace be with you inquire the jew's house out give him this deed and let him sign it we'll away tonight and be a day before our husbands home this deed will be well welcome to lorenzo that cannot be his ring i do accept most thankfully and so i pray you tell him furthermore i pray you show my youth old shylock's house thou mayst i warrant we shall have old swearing that they did give the rings away to men but we'll outface them and outswear them too  away make haste thou know'st where i will tarry that light we see is burning in my hall how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world so doth the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king until a king be by and then his state empties itself as doth an inland brook into the main of waters music hark nothing is good i see without respect methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren how many things by season seasoned are to their right praise and true perfection peace how the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awaked he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo by the bad voice we have been praying for our husbands' welfare which speed we hope the better for our words are they returned go in nerissa give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence  nor you lorenzo jessica nor you this night methinks is but the daylight sick it looks a little paler 'tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid let me give light but let me not be light for a light wife doth make a heavy husband and never be bassanio so for me but god sort all you are welcome home my lord you should in all sense be much bound to him for as i hear he was much bound for you sir you are very welcome to our house it must appear in other ways than words therefore i scant this breathing courtesy a quarrel ho already what's the matter you were to blame i must be plain with you to part so slightly with your wife's first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it and here he stands i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters now in faith gratiano you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief an 'twere to me i should be mad at it what ring gave you my lord not that i hope which you received of me even so void is your false heart of truth by heaven i will ne'er come in your bed until i see the ring if you had known the virtue of the ring or half her worthiness that gave the ring or your own honor to contain the ring you would not then have parted with the ring what man is there so much unreasonable if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony nerissa teaches me what to believe i'll die for 't but some woman had the ring let not that doctor e'er come near my house since he hath got the jewel that i loved and that which you did swear to keep for me i will become as liberal as you i'll not deny him anything i have no not my body nor my husband's bed know him i shall i am well sure of it lie not a night from home watch me like argus if you do not if i be left alone now by mine honor which is yet mine own i'll have that doctor for my bedfellow sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding mark you but that in both my eyes he doubly sees himself in each eye one swear by your double self and there's an oath of credit then you shall be his surety give him this and bid him keep it better than the other i had it of him pardon me bassanio for by this ring the doctor lay with me speak not so grossly you are all amazed here is a letter read it at your leisure it comes from padua from bellario there you shall find that portia was the doctor nerissa there her clerk lorenzo here shall witness i set forth as soon as you and even but now returned i have not yet entered my house antonio you are welcome and i have better news in store for you than you expect unseal this letter soon there you shall find three of your argosies are richly come to harbor suddenly you shall not know by what strange accident i chanc\u00e8d on this letter how now lorenzo my clerk hath some

their souls by reason guide his execution amen nestor i have a young conception in my brain be you my time to bring it to some shape this 'tis blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride that hath to this maturity blown up in rank achilles must or now be cropped or shedding breed a nursery of like evil to overbulk us all this challenge that the gallant hector sends however it is spread in general name relates in purpose only to achilles and wake him to the answer think you give pardon to my speech therefore 'tis meet achilles meet not hector let us like merchants first show foul wares and think perchance they'll sell if not the luster of the better shall exceed by showing the worse first do not consent that ever hector and achilles meet for both our honor and our shame in this are dogged with two strange followers what glory our achilles shares from hector were he not proud we all should share with him but he already is too insolent and it were better parch in afric sun than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes should he scape hector fair if he were foiled why then we do our main opinion crush in taint of our best man no make a lott'ry and by device let blockish ajax draw the sort to fight with hector among ourselves give him allowance for the better man for that will physic the great myrmidon who broils in loud applause and make him fall his crest that prouder than blue iris bends if the dull brainless ajax come safe off we'll dress him up in voices if he fail yet go we under our opinion still that we have better men but hit or miss our project's life this shape of sense assumes ajax employed plucks down achilles' plumes we saw him at the opening of his tent he is not sick achilles hath inveigled his fool from him he no you see he is his argument that has his argument achilles the amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie here comes patroclus the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure achilles will not to the field tomorrow he doth rely on none but carries on the stream of his dispose without observance or respect of any in will peculiar and in self admission things small as nothing for request's sake only he makes important possessed he is with greatness and speaks not to himself but with a pride that quarrels at self breath imagined worth holds in his blood such swoll'n and hot discourse that 'twixt his mental and his active parts kingdomed achilles in commotion rages and batters down himself what should i say he is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it cry no recovery o agamemnon let it not be so we'll consecrate the steps that ajax makes when they go from achilles shall the proud lord that bastes his arrogance with his own seam and never suffers matter of the world enter his thoughts save such as doth revolve and ruminate himself shall he be worshipped of that we hold an idol more than he no this thrice worthy and right valiant lord shall not so stale his palm nobly acquired nor by my will assubjugate his merit as amply titled as achilles is by going to achilles that were to enlard his fat already pride and add more coals to cancer when he burns with entertaining great hyperion this lord go to him jupiter forbid and say in thunder achilles go to him not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel the raven chides blackness wit would be out of fashion he would have ten shares my lord you feed too much on this dislike why 'tis this naming of him does him harm here is a man but 'tis before his face i will be silent know the whole world he is as valiant  if he were proud  ay or surly borne  thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure praise him that gat thee she that gave thee suck famed be thy tutor and thy parts of nature thrice famed beyond beyond thy erudition but he that disciplined thine arms to fight let mars divide eternity in twain and give him half and for thy vigor bull bearing milo his addition yield to sinewy ajax i will not praise thy wisdom which like a bourn a pale a shore confines thy spacious and dilated parts here's nestor instructed by the antiquary times he must he is he cannot but be wise  but pardon father nestor were your days as green as ajax' and your brain so tempered you should not have the eminence of him but be as ajax there is no tarrying here the hart achilles keeps thicket please it our great general to call together all his state of war fresh kings are come to troy tomorrow we must with all our main of power stand fast and here's a lord come knights from east to west and cull their flower ajax shall cope the best achilles stands i' th' entrance of his tent please it our general pass strangely by him as if he were forgot and princes all lay negligent and loose regard upon him i will come last 'tis like he'll question me why such unplausive eyes are bent why turned on him if so i have derision medicinable to use between your strangeness and his pride which his own will shall have desire to drink it may do good pride hath no other glass to show itself but pride for supple knees feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees now great thetis' son  a strange fellow here writes me that man how dearly ever parted how much in having or without or in cannot make boast to have that which he hath nor feels not what he owes but by reflection as when his virtues shining upon others heat them and they retort that heat again to the first giver i do not strain at the position  it is familiar but at the author's drift who in his circumstance expressly proves that no man is the lord of anything  though in and of him there be much consisting  till he communicate his parts to others nor doth he of himself know them for aught till he behold them formed in the applause where they're extended who like an arch reverb'rate the voice again or like a gate of steel fronting the sun receives and renders back his figure and his heat i was much rapt in this and apprehended here immediately th' unknown ajax heavens what a man is there a very horse that has he knows not what nature what things there are most abject in regard and dear in use what things again most dear in the esteem and poor in worth now shall we see tomorrow  an act that very chance doth throw upon him  ajax renowned o heavens what some men do while some men leave to do how some men creep in skittish fortune's hall whiles others play the idiots in her eyes how one man eats into another's pride while pride is fasting in his wantonness to see these grecian lords why even already they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder as if his foot were on brave hector's breast and great troy shrieking time hath my lord a wallet at his back wherein he puts alms for oblivion a great sized monster of ingratitudes those scraps are good deeds past which are devoured as fast as they are made forgot as soon as done perseverance dear my lord keeps honor bright to have done is to hang quite out of fashion like a rusty mail in monumental mock'ry take the instant way for honor travels in a strait so narrow where one but goes abreast keep then the path for emulation hath a thousand sons that one by one pursue if you give way or turn aside from the direct forthright like to an entered tide they all rush by and leave you hindmost or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank lie there for pavement to the abject rear o'errun and trampled on then what they do in present though less than yours in past must o'ertop yours for time is like a fashionable host that slightly shakes his parting guest by th' hand and with his arms outstretched as he would fly grasps in the comer welcome ever smiles and farewell goes out sighing let not virtue seek remuneration for the thing it was for beauty wit high birth vigor of bone desert in service love friendship charity are subjects all to envious and calumniating time one touch of nature makes the whole world kin that all with one consent praise newborn gauds though they are made and molded of things past and give to dust that is a little gilt more laud than gilt o'erdusted the present eye praises the present object then marvel not thou great and complete man that all the greeks begin to worship ajax since things in motion sooner catch the eye than what stirs not the cry went once on thee and still it might and yet it may again if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive and case thy reputation in thy tent whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves and drave great mars to faction but 'gainst your privacy the reasons are more potent and heroical 'tis known achilles that you are in love with one of priam's daughters is that a wonder the providence that's in a watchful state knows almost every grain of pluto's gold finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deep keeps place with thought and almost like the gods do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles there is a mystery with whom relation durst never meddle in the soul of state which hath an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to all the commerce that you have had with troy as perfectly is ours as yours my lord and better would it fit achilles much to throw down hector than polyxena but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home when fame shall in our islands sound her trump and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing great hector's sister did achilles win but our great ajax bravely beat down him farewell my lord i as your lover speak the fool slides o'er the ice that you should break no trumpet answers 'tis he i ken the manner of his gait he rises on the toe that spirit of his in aspiration lifts him from the earth yet is the kindness but particular 'twere better she were kissed in general o deadly gall and theme of all our scorns for which we lose our heads to gild his horns it were no match your nail against his horn may i sweet lady beg a kiss of you i do desire it why then for venus' sake give me a kiss when helen is a maid again and his never's my day and then a kiss of you fie fie upon her there's language in her eye her cheek her lip nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out at every joint and motive of her body o these encounterers so glib of tongue that give accosting welcome ere it comes and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts to every tickling

firm of word speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calmed his heart and hand both open and both free for what he has he gives what thinks he shows yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty nor dignifies an impair thought with breath manly as hector but more dangerous for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes to tender objects but he in heat of action is more vindicative than jealous love they call him troilus and on him erect a second hope as fairly built as hector thus says aeneas one that knows the youth even to his inches and with private soul did in great ilium thus translate him to me i wonder now how yonder city stands when we have here her base and pillar by us sir i foretold you then what would ensue my prophecy is but

off you flow to great distraction come my lord you have not patience come how now my lord you shake my lord at something will you go you will break out come come you have sworn patience my lord  all's done my lord why stay we then i cannot conjure trojan most sure she was nor mine my lord cressid was here but now what hath she done prince that can soil our mothers may worthy troilus be half attached with that which here his passion doth express o contain yourself your passion draws ears hither i'll bring you to the gates o courage courage princes great achilles is arming weeping cursing vowing vengeance patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood together with his mangled myrmidons that noseless handless hacked and chipped come to him crying on hector ajax hath lost a friend and foams at mouth and he is armed and at it roaring for troilus who hath done today mad and fantastic execution engaging and redeeming of himself with such a careless force and forceless care as if that

people strangely fantasied possessed with rumors full of idle dreams not knowing what they fear but full of fear and here's a prophet that i brought with me from forth the streets of pomfret whom i found with many hundreds treading on his heels to whom he sung in rude harsh sounding rhymes that ere the next ascension day at noon your highness should deliver up your crown the french my lord men's mouths are full of it besides i met lord bigot and lord salisbury with eyes as red as new enkindled fire and others more going to seek the grave of arthur whom they say is killed tonight on your

world knew you of this fair work beyond the infinite and boundless reach of mercy if thou didst this deed of death art thou damned hubert ha i'll tell thee what thou 'rt damned as black nay nothing is so black  thou art more deep damned than prince lucifer there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell as thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child if thou didst but consent to this most cruel act do but despair and if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread that ever spider twisted from her womb will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself put but a little water in a spoon and it shall be as all the ocean enough to stifle such a villain up i do suspect thee very grievously go bear him in thine arms i am amazed methinks and lose my way among the thorns and dangers of this world how easy dost thou take all england up from forth this morsel of dead royalty the life the right and truth of all this realm is fled to heaven and england now is left to tug and scamble and to part by th' teeth the unowed interest of proud swelling state now for the bare picked bone of majesty doth dogg\u00e8d war bristle his angry crest and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace now powers from home and discontents at home meet in one line and vast confusion waits as doth a raven on a sick fall'n beast the imminent decay of wrested pomp now happy he whose cloak and cincture can hold out this tempest bear away that child and follow me with speed i'll to the king a thousand businesses are brief in hand and heaven itself doth frown upon the land all kent hath yielded nothing there holds out but dover castle london hath received like a kind host the dauphin and his powers your nobles will not hear you but are gone to offer service to your enemy and wild amazement hurries up and down the little number of your doubtful friends they found him dead and cast into the streets an empty casket where the jewel of life by some damned hand was robbed and ta'en away so on my soul he did for aught he knew but wherefore do you droop why look you sad be great in act as you have been in thought let not the world see fear and sad distrust govern the motion of a kingly eye be stirring as the time be fire with fire threaten the threat'ner and outface the brow of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes that borrow their behaviors from the great grow great by your example and put on the dauntless spirit of resolution away and glister like the god of war when he intendeth to become the field show boldness and aspiring confidence what shall they seek the lion in his den and fright him there and make him tremble there o let it not be said forage and run to meet displeasure farther from the doors and grapple with him ere he come so nigh o inglorious league shall we upon the footing of our land send fair play orders and make compromise insinuation parley and base truce to arms invasive shall a beardless boy a cockered silken wanton brave our fields and flesh his spirit in a warlike soil mocking the air with colors idly spread and find no check let us my liege to arms perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace or if he do let it at least be said they saw we had a purpose of defense away then with good courage yet i know our party may well meet a prouder foe according to the fair play of the world let me have audience i am sent to speak my holy lord of milan from the king i come to learn how you have dealt for him and as you answer i do know the scope and warrant limited unto my tongue by all the blood that ever fury breathed the youth says well now hear our english king for thus his royalty doth speak in me he is prepared and reason too he should this apish and unmannerly approach this harnessed masque and unadvis\u00e8d revel this unheard sauciness and boyish troops the king doth smile at and is well prepared to whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms from out the circle of his territories that hand which had the strength even at your door to cudgel you and make you take the hatch to dive like buckets in conceal\u00e8d wells to crouch in litter of your stable planks to lie like pawns locked up in chests and trunks to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake even at the crying of your nation's crow thinking this voice an arm\u00e8d englishman  shall that victorious hand be feebled here that in your chambers gave you chastisement no know the gallant monarch is in arms and like an eagle o'er his aerie towers to souse annoyance that comes near his nest  and you degenerate you ingrate revolts you bloody neroes ripping up the womb of your dear mother england blush for shame for your own ladies and pale visaged maids like amazons come tripping after drums their thimbles into arm\u00e8d gauntlets change their needles to lances and their gentle hearts to fierce and bloody inclination no i will speak indeed your drums being beaten will cry out and so shall you being beaten do but start an echo with the clamor of thy drum and even at hand a drum is ready braced that shall reverberate all as loud as thine sound but another and another shall as loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear and mock the deep mouthed thunder for at hand not trusting to this halting legate here whom he hath used rather for sport than need is warlike john and in his forehead sits a bare ribbed death whose office is this day to feast upon whole thousands of the french and thou shalt find it dauphin do not doubt a friend what art thou whither dost thou go why may not i demand of thine affairs as well as thou of mine hubert i think who thou wilt an if thou please thou mayst befriend me so much as to think i come one way of the plantagenets come come sans compliment what news abroad brief then and what's the news show me the very wound of this ill news i am no woman i'll not swoon at it how did he take it who did taste to him who didst thou leave to tend his majesty withhold thine indignation mighty god and tempt us not to bear above our power i'll tell thee hubert half my power this night passing these flats are taken by the tide these lincoln washes have devour\u00e8d them myself well mounted hardly have escaped away before conduct me to the king i doubt he will be dead or ere i come o i am scalded with my violent motion and spleen of speed to see your majesty the dauphin is preparing hitherward where god he knows how we shall answer him for in a night the best part of my power as i upon advantage did remove were in the washes all unwarily devour\u00e8d by the unexpected flood art thou gone so i do but stay behind to do the office for thee of revenge and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven as it on earth hath been thy servant still  now now you stars that move in your right spheres where be your powers show now your mended faiths and instantly return with me again to push destruction and perpetual shame out of the weak door of our fainting land straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought the dauphin rages at our very heels he will the rather do it when he sees ourselves well sinew\u00e8d to our defense let it be so and you my noble prince with other princes that may best be spared shall wait upon your father's funeral thither shall it then and happily may your sweet self put on the lineal state and glory of the land to whom with all submission on my knee i do bequeath my faithful services and true subjection everlastingly o let us pay the time but needful woe since it hath been beforehand with our griefs this england never did nor never shall lie at the proud foot of a conqueror but when it first did help to wound itself now these her princes are come home again come the three corners of

expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of but i could then have looked on him without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his

approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colors are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar

others i have seen as that diamond of yours outlusters many i have beheld i could not but believe she excelled many but i have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the lady what do you esteem it at either your unparagoned mistress is dead or she's outprized by a trifle which the gods have given you you may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighboring ponds your ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplished courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last with five times so much conversation i should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion o'ervalues it something but i make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offense herein too i durst attempt it against any lady in the world what's that would i had put my estate and my neighbor's on th' approbation of what i have spoke yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and i will bring from thence that honor of hers which you imagine so reserved you are a friend and therein the wiser if you buy ladies' flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting but i see you have some religion in you that you fear i am the master of my speeches and would undergo what's spoken i swear by the gods it is one if i bring you no sufficient testimony that i have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too if i come off and leave her in such honor as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided i have your commendation for my more free entertainment your hand a covenant we will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve i will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded change you madam the worthy leonatus is in safety and greets your highness dearly all of her that is out of door most rich if she be furnished with a mind so rare she is alone th' arabian bird and i have lost the wager boldness be my friend arm me audacity from head to foot or like the parthian i shall flying fight  rather directly fly thanks fairest lady  what are men mad hath nature given them eyes to see this vaulted arch and the rich crop of sea and land which can distinguish 'twixt the fiery orbs above and the twinned stones upon the numbered beach and can we not partition make with spectacles so precious 'twixt fair and foul it cannot be i' th' eye for apes and monkeys 'twixt two such shes would chatter this way and contemn with mows the other nor i' th' judgment for idiots in this case of favor would be wisely definite nor i' th' appetite  sluttery to such neat excellence opposed should make desire vomit emptiness not so allured to feed the

i did leave him he's strange and peevish well madam exceeding pleasant none a stranger there so merry and so gamesome he is called the briton reveler i never saw him sad there is a frenchman his companion one an eminent monsieur that it seems much loves a gallian girl at home he furnaces the thick sighs from him whiles the jolly briton  your lord i mean laughs from 's free lungs cries o can my sides hold to think that man who knows by history report or his own proof what woman is yea what she cannot choose but must be will 's free hours languish for assur\u00e8d bondage ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter it is a recreation to be by and hear him mock the frenchman but heavens know some men are much to blame not he but yet heaven's bounty towards him might be used more thankfully in himself 'tis much in you which i account his beyond all talents whilst i am bound to wonder i am bound to pity too two creatures heartily lamentable what to hide me from the radiant sun

whose touch whose every touch would force the feeler's soul to th' oath of loyalty this object which takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye fixing it only here should i damned then slaver with lips as common as the stairs that mount the capitol join gripes with hands made hard with hourly falsehood falsehood as with labor then by peeping in an eye base and illustrous as the smoky light

priest betwixt cold sheets whiles he is vaulting variable ramps in your despite upon your purse revenge it i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure more noble than that runagate to your bed and will continue fast to your affection still close as sure let me my service tender on your lips o happy leonatus i may say the credit that thy lady hath of thee deserves thy trust and thy most perfect

which i doubt not you'll give me leave to spare when you shall find you need it not first her bedchamber  where i confess i slept not but profess had that was well worth watching it was hanged with tapestry of silk and silver the story proud cleopatra when she met her roman and cydnus swelled above the banks or for the press of boats or pride a piece of work so bravely done so rich that it did strive in workmanship and value which i wondered could be so rarely and exactly wrought since the true life on 't was  more particulars must justify my knowledge the chimney is south the chamber and

his description proved us unspeaking sots your daughter's chastity there it begins he spake of her as dian had hot dreams and she alone were cold whereat i wretch made scruple of his praise and wagered with him pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore upon his honored finger to attain in suit the place of 's bed and win this ring by hers and mine adultery he true knight no lesser of her honor confident than i did truly find her stakes this ring and would so had it been a carbuncle of phoebus' wheel and might so safely had it been all the worth of 's car away to britain post i in this design well may you sir remember me at court where i was taught of your chaste daughter the wide difference 'twixt amorous and villainous being thus quenched of hope not longing mine italian brain gan in your duller britain operate most vilely for my vantage excellent and to be brief my practice so prevailed that i returned with simular proof enough to make the noble leonatus mad by wounding his belief in her renown with tokens thus and thus averring notes of chamber hanging pictures this her bracelet  o cunning how i got it nay some marks of secret on her person that he could not but think her bond of chastity quite cracked i having ta'en the forfeit whereupon  methinks i see him now  i am down again but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee as then your force did take

prisoners with the speediest means or you shall hear in such a kind from me as will displease you my lord northumberland we license your departure with your son  send us your prisoners or you will hear of it lords give us leave the prince of wales and i must have some private conference but be near at hand for we shall presently have need of you i know not whether god will have it so for some displeasing service i have done that in his secret doom out of my blood he'll breed revengement and a scourge for me but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only marked for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings tell me else could such inordinate and low desires such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts such barren pleasures rude society as thou art matched withal and grafted to accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry at thy affections which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors thy place in council thou hast rudely lost which by thy younger brother is supplied and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectation of thy time is ruined and the soul of every man prophetically do forethink thy fall had i so lavish of my presence been so common hackneyed in the eyes of men so stale and cheap to vulgar company opinion that did help me to the crown had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment a fellow of no mark nor likelihood by being seldom seen i could not stir but like a comet i was wondered at that men would tell their children this is he others would say where which is bolingbroke and then i stole all courtesy from heaven and dressed myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from men's hearts loud shouts and salutations from their mouths even in the presence of the crown\u00e8d king thus did i keep my person fresh and new my presence like a robe pontifical ne'er seen but wondered at and so my state seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity the skipping king he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state mingled his royalty with cap'ring fools had his great name profan\u00e8d with their scorns and gave his countenance against his name to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative grew a companion to the common streets enfeoffed himself to popularity that being daily swallowed by men's eyes they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little more than a little is by much too much so when he had occasion to be seen he was but as the cuckoo is in june heard not regarded seen but with such eyes as sick and blunted with community afford no extraordinary gaze such as is bent on sunlike majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes but rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down slept in his face and rendered such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries being with his presence glutted gorged and full and in that very line harry standest thou for thou hast lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is aweary of thy common sight save mine which hath desired to see thee more which now doth that i would not have it do make blind itself with foolish tenderness for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh and even as i was then is percy now now by my scepter and my soul to boot he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession for of no right nor color like to right he doth fill fields with harness in the realm turns head against the lion's arm\u00e8d jaws and being no more in debt to years than thou leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms what never dying honor hath he got against renown\u00e8d douglas whose high deeds whose hot incursions and great name in arms holds from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ thrice hath this hotspur mars in swaddling clothes this infant warrior in his enterprises discomfited great douglas ta'en him once enlarg\u00e8d him and made a friend of him to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne and what say you to this percy northumberland the archbishop's grace of york douglas mortimer capitulate against us and are up but wherefore do i tell these news to thee why harry do i tell thee of my foes which art my nearest and dearest enemy thou that art like enough through vassal fear base inclination and the

the garment of rebellion with some fine color that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation and never yet did

office so begone we will not now be troubled with reply we offer fair take it advisedly hence therefore every leader to his charge for on their answer will we set on them and god befriend us as our cause is just i prithee harry withdraw thyself thou bleedest too much lord john of lancaster go you with him i will do so my lord of westmoreland lead him to his tent i saw him hold lord percy at the

serious vanity misshapen chaos of well seeming forms feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health still waking sleep that is not what it is this love feel i that feel no love in this dost thou not laugh good heart at what why such is love's transgression griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed with more of thine this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs being purged a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes being vexed a sea nourished with loving tears what is it else a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet farewell my coz tut i have lost myself i am not here this is not romeo he's some other where what shall i groan and tell thee a sick man in sadness makes his will  a word ill urged to one that is so ill in sadness cousin i do love a woman a right good markman and she's fair i love well in that hit you miss she'll not be hit with cupid's arrow she hath dian's wit and in strong proof of chastity well armed from love's weak childish bow she lives uncharmed she will not stay the siege of loving terms nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes nor ope her lap to saint seducing gold o she is rich in beauty only poor that when she dies with beauty dies her store she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste for beauty starved with her severity cuts beauty off from all posterity she is too fair too wise wisely too fair to merit bliss by making me despair she hath forsworn to love and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it

fearful date with this night's revels and expire the term of a despis\u00e8d life closed in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my sail on lusty gentlemen what lady's that which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight o she doth teach the torches to burn bright it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night as a rich jewel in an ethiop's ear  beauty too rich for use for earth too dear so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows the measure done i'll watch her place of stand and touching hers make bless\u00e8d my rude hand did my heart love till now forswear it sight for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine the gentle sin is this my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss have not saints lips and holy palmers too o then dear saint let lips do what hands do they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair then move not while my prayer's effect i take thus from my lips by thine my sin is purged sin from my lips o trespass sweetly urged give me my sin again what is her mother is she a capulet o dear account my life is my foe's debt ay so i fear the more is my unrest can i go forward when my heart is here turn back dull earth and find thy center out he jests at scars that never felt a wound but soft what light through yonder window breaks it is the east and juliet is the sun arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she be not her maid since she is envious her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it cast it off it is my lady o it is my love o that she knew she were she speaks yet she says nothing what of that her eye discourses i will answer it i am too bold 'tis not to me she speaks two of the fairest stars in all the heaven having some business do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return what if her eyes were there they in her head the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp her eye in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night see how she leans her cheek upon her hand o that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek she speaks o speak again bright angel for thou art as glorious to this night being o'er my head as is a wing\u00e8d messenger of heaven unto the white upturn\u00e8d wond'ring eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air shall i hear more or shall i speak at this i take thee at thy word call me but love and i'll be new baptized henceforth i never will be romeo by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am my name dear saint is hateful to myself because it is an enemy to thee had i it written i would tear the word neither fair maid if either thee dislike with love's light wings did i o'erperch these walls for stony limits cannot hold love out and what love can do that dares love attempt therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me alack there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet and i am proof against their enmity i have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes and but thou love me let them find me here my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogu\u00e8d wanting of thy love by love that first did prompt me to inquire he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes i am no pilot yet wert thou as far as that vast shore washed with the farthest sea i should adventure for such merchandise lady by yonder bless\u00e8d moon i vow that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops  what shall i swear by if my heart's dear love  o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine wouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose love o bless\u00e8d bless\u00e8d night i am afeard being in night all this is but a dream too flattering sweet to be substantial so thrive my soul  a thousand times the worse to want thy light love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books but love from love toward school with heavy looks it is my soul that calls upon my name how silver sweet sound lovers' tongues by night like softest music to attending ears my dear by the hour of nine let me stand here till thou remember it and i'll still stay to have thee still forget forgetting any other home but this i would i were thy bird sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast would i were sleep and peace so sweet to rest hence will i to my ghostly friar's close cell his help to crave and my dear hap to tell good morrow father that last

words then love devouring death do what he dare it is enough i may but call her mine ah juliet if the measure of thy joy be heaped like mine and that thy skill be more to blazon it then sweeten with thy breath this neighbor air and let rich music's tongue unfold the imagined happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter tybalt the reason that i have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting villain am i none therefore farewell i see thou knowest me not i do protest i never injured thee but love thee better than thou canst devise till thou shalt

hath made me effeminate and in my temper softened valor's steel this day's black fate on more days doth depend this but begins the woe others must end alive in triumph and mercutio slain away to heaven respective lenity and fire eyed fury be my conduct now  now tybalt take the villain back again that late thou gavest me for mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company either thou or i or both must go with him this shall determine that o i am fortune's fool father what news what is the prince's doom what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand that i yet know not what less than doomsday is the prince's doom ha banishment be merciful say death for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death do not say banishment there is no world without verona walls but purgatory torture hell itself hence banish\u00e8d is banished from the world and world's exile is death then banish\u00e8d is death mistermed calling death banish\u00e8d thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax and smilest upon the stroke that murders me 'tis torture and not mercy heaven is here where juliet lives and every cat and dog and little mouse every unworthy thing live here in heaven and may look on her but romeo may not more validity more honorable state more courtship lives in carrion flies than romeo they may seize on the white wonder of dear juliet's hand and steal immortal blessing from her lips who even in pure and vestal modesty still blush as thinking their own kisses sin but romeo may not he is banish\u00e8d flies may do this but i from this must fly they are free men but i am banish\u00e8d and sayest thou yet that exile is not death hadst thou no poison mixed no sharp ground knife no sudden mean of death though ne'er so mean but banish\u00e8d to kill me banish\u00e8d o friar the damn\u00e8d use that word in hell howling attends it how hast thou the heart being a divine a ghostly confessor a sin absolver and my friend professed to mangle me with that word banish\u00e8d o thou wilt speak again of banishment yet banish\u00e8d hang up philosophy unless philosophy can make a juliet displant a town reverse a prince's doom it helps not it prevails not talk no more how should they when that wise men have no eyes thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel wert thou as young as i juliet thy love an hour but married tybalt murder\u00e8d doting like me and like me banish\u00e8d then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair and fall upon the ground as i do now taking the measure of an unmade grave not i unless the breath of heartsick groans mistlike enfold me from the search of eyes nurse spakest thou of juliet how is it with her doth not she think me an old murderer now i have stained the childhood of our joy with blood removed but little from her own where is she and how doth she and what says my concealed lady to our canceled love as if that name shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her as that name's curs\u00e8d hand murdered her kinsman o tell me friar tell me in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name lodge tell me that i may sack the hateful mansion do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide how well my comfort is revived by this but that a joy past joy calls out on me it were a grief so brief to part with thee farewell it was the lark the herald of the morn no nightingale look love what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east night's candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops i must be gone and live or stay and die let me be ta'en let me be put to death i am content so thou wilt have it so i'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye 'tis but the pale reflex of cynthia's brow nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads i have more care to stay than will to go come death and welcome juliet wills it so how is 't my soul let's talk it is not day more light and light more dark and dark our woes farewell farewell one kiss and i'll descend farewell i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings love to thee i doubt it not and all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come and trust me love in my eye so do you dry sorrow drinks our blood adieu adieu if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep my dreams presage some joyful news at hand my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts i dreamt my lady came and found me dead strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor ah me how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadows are so rich in joy news from verona how now balthasar dost thou not bring me letters from the friar how doth my lady is my father well how doth my juliet that i ask again for nothing can be ill if she be well is it e'en so then i deny you stars  thou knowest my lodging get me ink and paper and hire post horses i will hence tonight tush thou art deceived leave me and do the thing i bid thee do hast thou no letters to me from the friar no matter get thee gone and hire those horses i'll be with thee straight well juliet i will lie with thee tonight let's see for means o mischief thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men i do remember an apothecary and hereabouts he dwells which late i noted in tattered weeds with overwhelming brows culling of simples meager were his looks sharp misery had worn him to the bones and in his needy shop a tortoise hung an alligator stuffed and other skins of ill shaped fishes and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses were thinly scattered to make up a show noting this penury to myself i said an if a man did need a poison now whose sale is present death in mantua here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him o this same thought did but forerun my need and this same needy man must sell it me as i remember this should be the house being holiday the beggar's shop is shut  what ho apothecary come hither man i see that thou art poor hold there is forty ducats let me have a dram of poison such soon speeding gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the life weary taker may fall dead and that the trunk may be discharged of breath as violently as hasty powder fired doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb art thou so bare and full of wretchedness and fearest to die famine is in thy cheeks need and oppression starveth in thy eyes contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back the world is not thy friend nor the world's law the world affords no law to make thee rich then be not poor but break it and take this i pay thy poverty and not thy will there is thy gold worse poison to men's souls doing more murder in this loathsome world than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh come cordial and not poison go with me to juliet's grave for there must i use thee give me that mattock and the wrenching iron hold take this letter early in the morning see thou deliver it to my lord and father give me the light upon thy life i charge thee whate'er thou hearest or seest stand all aloof and do not interrupt me in my course why i descend into this bed of death is partly to behold my lady's face but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger a precious ring a ring that i must use in dear employment therefore hence begone but if thou jealous dost return to pry in what i farther shall intend to do by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs the time and my intents are savage wild more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea so shalt thou show me friendship take thou that live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow thou detestable maw thou womb of death gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open and in despite i'll cram thee with more food i must indeed and therefore came i hither good gentle youth tempt not a desp'rate man fly hence and leave me think upon these gone let them affright thee i beseech thee youth put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury o begone by heaven i love thee better than myself for i come hither armed against myself stay not begone live and hereafter say a madman's mercy bid thee run away wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy in faith i will let me peruse this face mercutio's kinsman noble county paris what said my man when my betoss\u00e8d soul did not attend him as we rode i think he told me paris should have married juliet said he not so or did i dream it so or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet to think it was so o give me thy hand one writ with me in sour misfortune's book i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave  a grave o no a lantern slaughtered youth for here lies juliet and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light  death lie thou there by a dead man interred how oft when men are at the point of death have they been merry which their keepers call a light'ning before death o how may i call this a light'ning o my love my wife death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty thou art not conquered beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks and death's pale flag is not advanc\u00e8d there  tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet o what more favor can i do to thee than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy forgive me cousin ah dear juliet why art thou yet so fair shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous and that the lean abhorr\u00e8d monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour for fear of that i still will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night depart again here here will i remain with worms that are thy chambermaids o here will i set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world wearied flesh eyes look your last arms take your last embrace and lips o you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death come bitter conduct come unsavory guide thou desperate pilot now at once run on the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark here's to my love o true apothecary

import and the neglecting it may do much danger friar john go hence get me an iron crow and bring it straight unto my cell now must i to the monument alone within this three hours will fair juliet

here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemn\u00e8d and myself excused i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeo's faithful wife i married them and their stol'n marriage day was tybalt's doomsday whose untimely death banished the new made bridegroom from this city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined you to remove that siege of grief from her betrothed and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutored by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave being the time the potion's force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stayed by accident and yesternight returned my letter back then all alone at the prefix\u00e8d hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred's vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awakening here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificed some hour before his time unto the rigor of severest law", "Tit_Aaron": "now climbeth

bound to aaron's charming eyes than is prometheus tied to caucasus away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts i will be bright and shine in pearl and gold to wait upon this new made emperess to wait said i to wanton with this queen this goddess this semiramis this nymph this siren that will charm rome's saturnine and see his shipwrack and his commonweal's holla what storm is this clubs clubs these lovers will not keep the peace why how now lords so near the emperor's palace dare you draw and maintain such a quarrel openly full well i wot the ground of all this grudge i would not for a million of gold the cause were known to them it most concerns nor would your noble mother for much more be so dishonored in the court of rome for shame put up away i say now by the gods that warlike goths adore this petty brabble will undo us all why lords and think you not how dangerous it is to jet upon a prince's right what is lavinia then become so loose or bassianus so degenerate that for her love such quarrels may be broached without controlment justice or revenge young lords beware and should the empress know this discord's ground the music would not please why are you mad or know you not in rome how furious and impatient they be and cannot brook competitors in love i tell you lords you do but plot your deaths by this device to achieve her how ay and as good as saturninus may why then it seems some certain snatch or so would serve your turns would you had hit it too then should not we be tired with this ado why hark you hark you and are you such fools to square for this would it offend you then that both should speed for shame be friends and join for that you jar 'tis policy and stratagem must do that you affect and so must you resolve that what you cannot as you would achieve you must perforce accomplish as you may take this of me lucrece was not more chaste than this lavinia bassianus' love a speedier course than ling'ring languishment must we pursue and i have found the path my lords a solemn hunting is in hand there will the lovely roman ladies troop the forest walks are wide and spacious and many unfrequented plots there are fitted by kind for rape

vengeance consecrate will we acquaint withal what we intend and she shall file our engines with advice that will not suffer you to square yourselves but to your wishes' height advance you both the emperor's court is like the house of fame the palace full of tongues of eyes and ears the woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull there speak and strike brave boys and take your turns there serve your lust shadowed from heaven's eye and revel in lavinia's treasury he that had wit would think that i had none to bury so much gold under a tree and never after to inherit it let him that thinks of me so abjectly know that this gold must coin a stratagem which cunningly effected will beget a very excellent piece of villainy and so repose sweet gold for their unrest that have their alms out of the empress' chest madam though venus govern your desires saturn is dominator over mine what signifies my deadly standing eye my silence and my cloudy melancholy my fleece of woolly hair that now

wash their hands in bassianus' blood seest thou this letter take it up i pray thee and give the king this fatal plotted scroll now question me no more we are espied here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty which dreads not yet their lives' destruction no more great empress bassianus comes be cross with him and i'll go fetch thy sons to back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they be come on my lords the better foot before straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit where i espied the panther fast asleep now will i fetch the king to find them here that he thereby may have a likely guess how these

titus or any one of you chop off your hand and send it to the king he for the same will send thee hither both thy sons alive and that shall be the ransom for their fault nay come agree whose hand shall go along for fear they die before their pardon come if that be called deceit i will be honest and never whilst i live deceive men so but i'll deceive you in another sort and that you'll say ere half an hour pass i go andronicus and for thy hand look by and by to have thy sons with thee their heads i mean o how this villainy doth fat me with the very thoughts of it let fools do good and fair men call for grace aaron will have his soul black like his face ay some mad message from his mad grandfather ay just a verse in horace right you have it now what a thing it is to be an ass here's no sound jest the old man hath found their guilt and sends them weapons wrapped about with lines that wound beyond their feeling to the quick but were our witty empress well afoot she would applaud andronicus' conceit but let her rest in her unrest awhile  and now young lords was 't not a happy star led us to rome strangers and more than so captives to be advanc\u00e8d to this height it did me

son and heir i tell you younglings not enceladus with all his threat'ning band of typhon's brood nor great alcides nor the god of war shall seize this prey out of his father's hands what what you sanguine shallow hearted boys you white limed walls you alehouse painted signs coal black is better than another hue in that it scorns to bear another hue for all the water in the ocean can never turn the swan's black legs to white although she lave them hourly in the flood tell the empress from me i am of age to keep mine own excuse it how she can my mistress is my mistress this myself the vigor and the picture of my youth this before all the world do i prefer this maugre all the world will i keep safe or some of you shall smoke for it in rome why there's the privilege your beauty bears fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing the close enacts and counsels of thy heart here's a young lad framed of another leer look how the black slave smiles upon the father as who should say old lad i am thine own he is your brother lords sensibly fed of that self blood that first gave life to you and from that womb where you imprisoned were he is enfranchis\u00e8d and come to light nay he is your brother by the surer side although my seal be stamp\u00e8d in his face then sit we down and let us all consult my son and i will have the wind of you keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety why so brave lords when we join in league i am a lamb but if you brave the moor the chaf\u00e8d boar the mountain lioness the ocean swells not so as aaron storms but say again how many saw the child the empress the midwife and yourself two may keep counsel when the third's away go to the empress tell her this i said wheak wheak so cries a pig prepar\u00e8d to the spit o lord sir 'tis a deed of policy shall she live to betray this guilt of ours a long tongued babbling gossip no lords no and now be it known to you my full intent not far one muliteus my countryman his wife but yesternight was brought to bed his child is like to her fair as you are go pack with him and give the mother gold and tell them both the circumstance of all and how by this their child shall be advanced and be receiv\u00e8d for the emperor's heir and substituted in the place of mine to calm this tempest whirling in the court and let the emperor dandle him for his own hark you lords you see i have given her physic and you must needs bestow her funeral the fields are near and you are gallant grooms this done see that you take no longer days but send the midwife presently to me the midwife and the nurse well made away then let the ladies tattle what they please now to the goths as swift as swallow flies there to dispose this treasure in mine arms and secretly to greet the empress' friends  come on you thick lipped slave i'll bear you hence for it is you that puts us to our shifts i'll make you feed on berries and on roots and feed on curds and whey and suck the goat and cabin in a cave and bring you up to be a warrior and command a camp touch not the boy he is of royal blood lucius save the child and bear it from me to the empress if thou do this i'll show thee wondrous things that highly may advantage thee to hear if thou wilt not befall what may befall i'll speak no more but vengeance rot you all and if it please thee why assure thee lucius 'twill vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak for i must talk of murders rapes and massacres acts of black night abominable deeds complots of mischief treason villainies ruthful to hear yet piteously performed and this shall all be buried in my death unless thou swear to me my child shall live swear that he shall and then i will begin what if i do not as indeed i do not yet for i know thou art religious and hast a thing within thee call\u00e8d conscience with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies which i have seen thee careful to observe therefore i urge thy oath for that i know an idiot holds his bauble for a god and keeps the oath which by that god he swears to that i'll urge him therefore thou shalt vow by that same god what god soe'er it be that thou adorest and hast in reverence to save my boy to nourish and bring him up or else i will discover naught to thee first know thou i begot him on the empress tut lucius this was but a deed of charity to that which thou shalt hear of me anon 'twas her two sons that murdered bassianus they cut thy sister's tongue and ravished her and cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest why she was washed and cut and trimmed and 'twas trim sport for them which had the doing of it indeed i was their tutor to instruct them that codding spirit had they from their mother as sure a card as ever won the set that bloody mind i think they learned of me as true a dog as ever fought at head well let my deeds be witness of my worth i trained thy brethren to that guileful hole where the dead corpse of bassianus lay i wrote the letter that thy father found and hid the gold within that letter mentioned confederate with the queen and her two sons and what not done that thou hast cause to rue wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it i played the cheater for thy father's hand and when i had it drew myself apart and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter i pried me through the crevice of a wall when for his hand he had his two sons' heads beheld his tears and laughed so heartily that both mine eyes were rainy like to his and when i told the empress of this sport she sounded almost at my pleasing tale and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses ay like a black dog as the saying is ay that i had not done a thousand more even now i curse the day and yet i think few come within the compass of my curse  wherein i did not some notorious ill as kill a man or else devise his death ravish a maid or plot the way to do it accuse some innocent and forswear myself set deadly enmity between two friends make poor men's cattle break their necks set fire on barns and haystalks in the night and bid the owners quench them with their tears oft have i digged up dead men from their graves and set them upright at their dear friends' door even when their sorrows almost was forgot and on their skins as on the bark of trees have with my knife carv\u00e8d in roman letters let not your sorrow die though i am dead but i have done a thousand dreadful things as willingly as one would kill a fly and nothing grieves me heartily indeed but that i cannot do ten thousand more if there be devils would i were a devil to live and burn in everlasting fire so i might have your company in hell but to torment you with my bitter tongue some devil whisper curses in my ear and prompt me that my tongue may utter forth the venomous malice of my swelling heart ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb i am no baby i that with base prayers i should repent the evils i have done ten thousand worse than ever yet i did would i perform if i might have my will if one good deed in all my life i did i do repent it from my very soul", "Mac_Macbeth": "so foul and fair a day i have not seen speak if you can what are you stay you imperfect speakers tell me more by

swelling act of the imperial theme i thank you gentlemen this supernatural soliciting cannot be ill cannot be good if ill why hath it given me earnest of success commencing in a truth i am thane of

imaginings my thought whose murder yet is but fantastical shakes so my single state of man that function is smothered in surmise and nothing is but what is not if chance will have me king why chance

your approach so humbly take my leave the prince of cumberland that is a step on which i must fall down or else o'erleap for in my way it lies stars hide your fires let not light see my black and deep desires the eye wink at the hand yet let that be which the eye fears when it is done to see my dearest love duncan comes here tonight tomorrow as he purposes we will speak further if it were done when 'tis done then 'twere well it were done quickly if th' assassination could trammel up the consequence and catch with his surcease success that but this blow might be the be all and the end all here but here upon this bank and shoal of time we'd jump the life to come but in these cases we still have judgment here that we but teach bloody instructions which being taught return to plague th' inventor this even handed justice commends th' ingredience of our poisoned chalice to our own lips he's here in double trust first as i am his kinsman and his subject strong both against the deed then as his host who should against his murderer shut the door not bear the knife myself besides this duncan hath borne his faculties so meek hath been so clear in his great office that his virtues will plead like angels trumpet tongued against the deep damnation of his taking off and pity like a naked newborn babe striding the blast or heaven's cherubin horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air

the heat oppress\u00e8d brain i see thee yet in form as palpable as this which now i draw thou marshal'st me the way that i was going and such an instrument i was to use mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses or else worth all the rest i see thee still and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood which was not so before there's no such thing it is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes now o'er the one half world nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse the curtained sleep witchcraft celebrates pale hecate's off'rings and withered murder alarumed by his sentinel the wolf whose howl's his watch thus with his stealthy pace with tarquin's ravishing strides towards his design moves like a ghost thou sure and firm set earth hear not my steps which way they walk for

lies i' th' second chamber this is a sorry sight there's one did laugh in 's sleep and one cried murder that they did wake each other i stood and heard them but they did say their prayers and addressed them again to sleep one cried god bless us and amen the other as they had seen me with these hangman's hands list'ning their fear i could not say amen when they did say god bless us but wherefore could not i pronounce amen i had most need of blessing and amen stuck in my throat methought i heard a voice cry sleep no more macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care the death of each day's life sore labor's bath balm of hurt minds great nature's second course chief nourisher in life's feast still it cried sleep no more to all the house glamis hath murdered sleep and therefore cawdor shall sleep no more macbeth shall sleep no more i'll go no more i am afraid to think what i have done look on 't again i dare not whence is that knocking how is 't with me when every noise appalls me what hands are here ha they pluck out mine eyes will all great neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand no this my hand will rather the

and furious loyal and neutral in a moment no man th' expedition of my violent love outrun the pauser reason here lay duncan his silver skin laced with his golden blood and his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature for ruin's wasteful entrance there the murderers steeped in the colors of their trade their daggers unmannerly breeched with gore who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make 's love known so all let's briefly put on manly readiness and meet i' th' hall together here's our chief guest tonight we hold a solemn supper sir and i'll request your presence ride you this afternoon we should have else desired your good advice which still hath been both grave and prosperous in this day's council but we'll take tomorrow is 't far you ride fail not our feast we hear our bloody cousins are bestowed in england and in ireland not confessing their cruel parricide filling their hearers with strange invention but of that tomorrow when therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly hie you to horse adieu till you return at night goes fleance with you i wish your horses swift and sure of foot and so i do commend you to their backs farewell let every man be master of his time till seven at night to make society the sweeter welcome we will keep ourself till suppertime alone while then god be with you sirrah a word with you attend those men our pleasure bring them before us to be thus is nothing but to be safely thus our fears in banquo stick deep and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be feared 'tis much he dares and to that dauntless temper of his mind he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor to act in safety there is none but he whose being i do fear and under him my genius is rebuked as it is said mark antony's was by caesar he chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me and bade them speak to him then prophet like they hailed him father to a line of kings upon my head they placed a fruitless crown and put a barren scepter in my grip thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand no son of mine succeeding if 't be so for banquo's issue have i filed my mind for them the gracious duncan have i murdered put rancors in the vessel of my peace only for them and mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man to make them kings the seeds of banquo kings rather than so come fate into the list and champion me to th' utterance who's there now go to the door and stay there till we call was it not yesterday we spoke together well then now have you considered of my speeches know that it was he in the times past which held you so under fortune which you thought had been our innocent self this i made good to you in our last conference passed in probation with you how you were borne in hand how crossed the instruments who wrought with them and all things else that might to half a soul and to a notion crazed say thus did banquo i did so and went further which is now our point of second meeting do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go are you so gospeled to pray for this good man and for his issue whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave and beggared yours forever ay in the catalogue you go for men as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs shoughs water rugs and demi wolves are clept all by the name of dogs the valued file distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle the housekeeper the hunter every one according to the gift which bounteous nature hath in him closed whereby he does receive particular addition from the bill that writes them all alike and so of men now if you have a station in the file not i' th' worst rank of manhood say 't and i will put that business in your bosoms whose execution takes your enemy off grapples you to the heart and love of us who wear our health but sickly in his life which in his death were perfect both of you know banquo was your enemy so is he mine and in such bloody distance that every minute of his being thrusts against my near'st of life and though i could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it yet i must not for certain friends that are both his and mine whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall who i myself struck down and thence it is that i to your assistance do make love masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons your spirits shine through you within this hour at most i will advise you where to plant yourselves acquaint you with the perfect spy o' th' time the moment on 't for 't must be done tonight and something from the palace always thought that i require a clearness and with him to leave no rubs nor botches in the work fleance his son that keeps him company whose absence is no less material to me than is his father's must embrace the fate of that dark hour resolve yourselves apart i'll come to you anon i'll call upon you straight abide within it is concluded banquo thy soul's flight if it find heaven must find it out tonight we have scorched the snake not killed it she'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth but let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly better be with the dead whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy duncan is in his grave after life's fitful fever he sleeps well treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison malice domestic foreign levy nothing can touch him further so shall i love and so i pray be you let your remembrance apply to banquo present him eminence both with eye and tongue unsafe the while that we must lave our honors in these flattering streams and make our faces vizards to our hearts disguising what they are o full of scorpions is my mind dear wife thou know'st that banquo and his fleance lives there's comfort yet they are assailable then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown his cloistered flight ere to black hecate's summons the shard born beetle with his drowsy hums hath rung night's yawning peal there shall be done a deed of dreadful note be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck till thou applaud the deed come seeling night scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day and with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale light thickens and the crow makes wing to th' rooky wood good things of day begin to droop and drowse whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse  thou marvel'st at my words but hold thee still things bad begun make strong themselves by ill so prithee go with me you know your own degrees sit down at first and last the hearty welcome ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host our hostess keeps her state but in best time we will require her welcome see they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks both sides are even here i'll sit i' th' midst be large in mirth anon we'll drink a measure the table round there's blood upon thy face 'tis better thee without than he within is he dispatched thou art the best o' th' cutthroats yet he's good that did the like for fleance if thou didst it thou art the nonpareil then comes my fit again i had else been perfect whole as the marble founded as the rock as broad and general as the casing air but now i am cabined cribbed confined bound in to saucy doubts and fears but banquo's safe thanks for that there the grown serpent lies the worm that's fled hath nature that in time will venom breed no teeth for th' present get thee gone tomorrow we'll hear ourselves again sweet remembrancer  now good digestion wait on appetite and health on both here had we now our country's honor roofed were the graced person of our banquo present who may i rather challenge for unkindness than pity for mischance the table's full where which of you have done this thou canst not say i did it never shake thy gory locks at me ay and a bold one that dare look on that which might appall the devil prithee see there behold look lo how say you why what care i if thou canst nod speak too  if charnel houses and our graves must send those that we bury back our monuments shall be the maws of kites if i stand here i saw him blood hath been shed ere now i' th' olden time ere humane statute purged the gentle weal ay and since too murders have been performed too terrible for the ear the time has been that when the brains were out the man would die and there an end but now they rise again with twenty mortal murders on their crowns and push us from our stools this is more strange than such a murder is i do forget  do not muse at me my most worthy friends i have a strange infirmity which is nothing to those that know me come love and health to all then i'll sit down give me some wine fill full i drink to th' general joy o' th' whole table and to our dear friend banquo whom we miss would he were here to all and him we thirst and all to all avaunt and quit my sight let the earth hide thee thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with what man dare i dare approach thou like the rugged russian bear the armed rhinoceros or th' hyrcan tiger take any shape but that and my firm nerves shall never tremble or be alive again and dare me to the desert with thy sword if trembling i inhabit then protest me the baby of a girl hence horrible shadow unreal mock'ry hence why so being gone i am a man again pray you sit still can such things be and overcome us like a summer's cloud without our special wonder you make me strange even to the disposition that i owe when now i think you can behold such sights and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks when mine is blanched with fear it will have blood they say blood will have blood stones have been known to move and trees to speak augurs and understood relations have by maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth the secret'st man of blood what is the night how say'st thou that macduff denies his person at our great bidding i hear it by the way but i will send there's not a one of them but in his house i keep a servant fee'd i will tomorrow and betimes i will to the we\u00efrd sisters more shall they speak for

 whate'er thou art for thy good caution thanks thou hast harped my fear aright but one word more  had i three ears i'd hear thee then live macduff what need i fear of thee but yet i'll make assurance double sure and take a bond of fate thou shalt not live that i may tell pale hearted fear it lies and sleep in spite of thunder what is this that rises like the issue of a king and wears upon his baby brow the round and top of sovereignty that will never be who can impress the forest bid the tree unfix his earthbound root sweet bodements good rebellious dead rise never till the wood of birnam rise

happy or else i often had been miserable peace villain nothing but my fortune i take your offer and will live with you provided that you do no outrages on silly women or poor passengers how use doth

so some gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate scratched face well you are a rare parrot teacher i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer but keep your way i' god's name i have done i noted her not but i looked on her do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex why i' faith methinks she's too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation i can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is i do not like her would you buy her that you enquire after her yea and a case to put it into but speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting jack to tell us cupid is a good hare finder and vulcan a rare carpenter come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song i can see yet without spectacles and i see no such

lord it is not so nor 'twas not so but indeed god forbid it should be so and by my two faiths and troths my lord i spoke mine that i neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me i will die in it at the stake that a woman conceived me i thank her that she brought me up i likewise give her most humble thanks but that i will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me because i will not do them the wrong to mistrust any i will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is for the which i may go the finer i will live a bachelor with anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love prove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get again

business county what fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck like an usurer's chain or under your arm like a lieutenant's scarf you must wear it one way for the prince hath got your hero why that's spoken like an honest drover so they sell bullocks but did you think the prince would have served you thus ho now you strike like the blind man 'twas the boy that stole your meat and you'll beat the post alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges but that my lady beatrice should know me and not know me the prince's fool ha it may be i go under that title because i am merry yea but so i am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out well i'll be revenged as i may troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren i told him and i think i told him true that your grace had got the goodwill of this young lady and i offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped the flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyed with finding a bird's nest shows it his companion and he steals it yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as i take it have stolen his bird's nest if their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly o she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her she told me not thinking i had been myself that i was the prince's jester that i was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me she speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star i would not marry her though she were endowed with all that adam had left him before he transgressed she would have made hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal ate in good apparel i would to god some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follows her will your grace command me any service to the world's end i will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on i will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of asia bring you the length of prester john's foot fetch you a hair off the great cham's beard do you any embassage to the pygmies rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy you have no employment for me o god sir here's a dish i love not i cannot endure my lady tongue boy in my chamber window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard i know that but i would have thee hence and here again i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is claudio i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes may i be so converted and see with these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but i'll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich she shall be that's certain wise or i'll none virtuous or i'll never cheapen her fair or i'll never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not i for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what color it please god ha the prince and monsieur love i will hide me in the arbor now divine air now is his soul ravished is it not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out of men's bodies well a horn for my money when all's done an he had been a dog that should have howled thus they would have hanged him and i pray god his bad voice bode no mischief i had as lief have heard the night raven come what plague could have come after it is 't possible sits the wind in that corner i should think this a gull but that the white bearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide himself in such reverence this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent love me why it must be requited i hear how i am censured they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is fair 'tis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous 'tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horribly in love with her i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a

into our kingdom use us and it my good lord have great care i be not found a talker we are busy go and once more in mine arms i bid him welcome and thank the holy conclave for their loves they have

god forbid else cardinal prithee call gardiner to me my new secretary i find him a fit fellow come hither gardiner deliver this with modesty to th' queen the most convenient place that i can think of for such receipt of learning is blackfriars there you shall meet about this weighty business my wolsey see it furnished o my lord would it not grieve an able man to leave so sweet a bedfellow but

has carried herself towards me my lord cardinal i do excuse you yea upon mine honor i free you from 't you are not to be taught that you have many enemies that know not why they are so but like to village curs bark when their fellows do by some of these the queen is put in anger you're excused but will you be more justified you ever have wished the sleeping of this business never desired it to be stirred but oft have hindered oft the passages made toward it on my honor i speak my good lord cardinal to this point and thus far clear him now what moved me to 't i will be bold with time and your attention then mark th' inducement thus it came give heed to 't my conscience first received a tenderness scruple and prick on certain speeches uttered by th' bishop of bayonne then french ambassador who had been hither sent on the debating a marriage 'twixt the duke of orleans and our daughter mary i' th' progress of this business ere a determinate resolution he i mean the bishop did require a respite wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate respecting this our marriage with the dowager sometime our brother's wife this respite shook the bosom of my conscience entered me yea with a spitting power and made to tremble the region of my breast which forced such way that many mazed considerings did throng and pressed in with this caution first methought i stood not in the smile of heaven who had commanded nature that my lady's womb if it conceived a male child by me should do no more offices of life to 't than the grave does to th' dead for her male issue or died where they were made or shortly after this world had aired them hence i took a thought this was a judgment on me that my kingdom well worthy the best heir o' th' world should not be gladded in 't by me then follows that i weighed the danger which my realms stood in by this my issue's fail and that gave to me many a groaning throe thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience i did steer toward this remedy whereupon we are now present here together that's to say i meant to rectify my conscience which i then did feel full sick and yet not well by all the reverend fathers of the land and doctors learn\u00e8d first i began in private with you my lord of lincoln you remember how under my oppression i did reek when i first moved you i have spoke long be pleased yourself to say how far you satisfied me i then moved you my lord of canterbury and got your leave to make this present summons unsolicited i left no reverend person in this court but by particular consent proceeded under your hands and seals therefore go on for no dislike i' th' world against the person of the good queen but the sharp thorny points of my alleg\u00e8d reasons drives this forward prove but our marriage lawful by my life and kingly dignity we are contented to wear our mortal state to come with her katherine our queen before the primest creature that's paragoned o' th' world i may perceive these cardinals trifle with me i abhor this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome my learn\u00e8d and well belov\u00e8d servant cranmer prithee return with thy approach i know my comfort comes along break up the court i say set on what piles of wealth hath he accumulated to his own portion and what expense by th' hour seems to flow from him how i' th' name of thrift does he rake this together now my lords saw you the cardinal it may well be there is a mutiny in 's mind this morning papers of state he sent me to peruse as i required and wot you what i found there on my conscience put unwittingly  forsooth an inventory thus importing the several parcels of his plate his treasure rich stuffs and ornaments of household which i find at such proud rate that it outspeaks possession of a subject if we did think his contemplation were above the earth and fixed on spiritual object he should still dwell in his musings but i am afraid his thinkings are below the moon not worth his serious considering good my lord you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory of your best graces in your mind the which you were now running o'er you have scarce time to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span to keep your earthly audit sure in that i deem you an ill husband and am glad to have you therein my companion you have said well 'tis well said again and 'tis a kind of good deed to say well and yet words are no deeds my father loved you he said he did and with his deed did crown his word upon you since i had my office i have kept you next my heart have not alone employed you where high profits might come home but pared my present havings to bestow my bounties upon you have i not made you the prime man of the state i pray you tell me if what i now pronounce you have found true and if you may confess it say withal if you are bound to us or no what say you fairly answered a loyal and obedient subject is therein illustrated the honor of it does pay the act of it as i' th' contrary the foulness is the punishment i presume that as my hand has opened bounty to you my heart dropped love my power rained honor more on you than any so your hand and heart your brain and every function of your power should notwithstanding that your bond of duty as 'twere in love's particular be more to me your friend than any 'tis nobly spoken  take notice lords he has a loyal breast for you have seen him open 't read o'er this and after this and then to breakfast with what appetite you have charles i will play no more tonight my mind's not on 't you are too hard for me but little charles nor shall not when my fancy's on my play  now lovell from the queen what is the news what sayst thou ha to pray for her what is she crying out alas good lady 'tis midnight charles prithee to bed and in thy prayers remember th' estate of my poor queen leave me alone for i must think of that which company would not be friendly to charles good night well sir what follows ha canterbury 'tis true where is he denny bring him to us avoid the gallery ha i have said be gone what how now my lord you do desire to know wherefore i sent for you pray you arise my good and gracious lord of canterbury come you and i must walk a turn together i have news to tell you come come give me your hand ah my good lord i grieve at what i speak and am right sorry to repeat what follows i have and most unwillingly of late heard many grievous i do say my lord grievous complaints of you which being considered have moved us and our council that you shall this morning come before us where i know you cannot with such freedom purge yourself but that till further trial in those charges which will require your answer you must take your patience to you and be well contented to make your house our tower you a brother of us it fits we thus proceed or else no witness would come against you stand up good canterbury thy truth and thy integrity is rooted in us thy friend give me thy hand stand up prithee let's walk now by my halidom what manner of man are you my lord i looked you would have given me your petition that i should have ta'en some pains to bring together yourself and your accusers and to have heard you without endurance further know you not how your state stands i' th' world with the whole world your enemies are many and not small their practices must bear the same proportion and not ever the justice and the truth o' th' question carries the due o' th' verdict with it at what ease might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt to swear against you such things have been done you are potently opposed and with a malice of as great size ween you of better luck i mean in perjured witness than your master whose minister you are whiles here he lived upon this naughty earth go to go to you take a precipice for no leap of danger and woo your own destruction be of good cheer they shall no more prevail than we give way to keep comfort to you and this morning see you do appear before them if they shall chance in charging you with matters to commit you the best persuasions to the contrary fail not to use and with what vehemency th' occasion shall instruct you if entreaties will render you no remedy this ring deliver them and your appeal to us there make before them look the good man weeps he's honest on mine honor god's blest mother i swear he is truehearted and a soul none better in my kingdom get you gone and do as i have bid you he has strangled his language in his tears now by thy looks i guess thy message is the queen delivered say ay and of a boy lovell give her an hundred marks i'll to the queen what's that butts body o' me where is it ha 'tis he indeed is this the honor they do one another 'tis well there's one above 'em yet i had thought they had parted so much honesty among 'em  at least good manners as not thus to suffer a man of his place and so near our favor to dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures and at the door too like a post with packets by holy mary butts there's knavery let 'em alone and draw the curtain close we shall hear more anon you were ever good at sudden commendations bishop of winchester but know i come not to hear such flattery now and in my presence they are too thin and base to hide offenses to me you cannot reach you play the spaniel and think with wagging of your tongue to win me but whatsoe'er thou tak'st me for i'm sure thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody  good man sit down now let me see the proudest he that dares most but wag his finger at thee by all that's holy he had better starve than but once think this place becomes thee not no sir it does not please me i had thought i had had men of some understanding and wisdom of my council but i find none was it discretion lords to let this man this good man few of you deserve that title  this honest man wait like a lousy footboy at chamber door and one as great as you are why what a shame was this did my commission bid you so far forget yourselves i gave you power as he was a councillor to try him not as a groom there's some of you i see more out of malice than integrity would try him to the utmost had you mean which you shall never have while i live well well my lords respect him take him and use him well he's worthy of it i will say thus much for him if a prince may be beholding to a subject i am for his love and service so to him make me no more ado but all embrace him be friends for shame my lords my lord of canterbury i have a suit which you must not deny me that is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism you must be godfather and answer for her come come my lord you'd spare your spoons you shall have two noble partners with you the old duchess of norfolk and lady marquess dorset will these please you  once more my lord of winchester i charge you embrace and love this man good man those joyful tears show thy true heart the common voice i see is verified of thee which says thus do my lord of canterbury a shrewd turn and he's your friend forever  come lords we trifle time away i long to have this young one made a christian as i have made you one lords one remain so i grow stronger you more honor gain

within this house you are old enough now and yet methinks you lose  father tear the crown from the usurper's head sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly brother though i be youngest give me leave about that which concerns your grace and us the crown of england father which is yours your right depends not on his life or death no god forbid your grace should be forsworn i'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak an oath is of no moment being not took before a true and lawful magistrate that hath authority over him that swears henry had none but did usurp the place then seeing 'twas he that made you to depose your oath my lord is vain and frivolous therefore to arms and father do but think how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown within whose circuit is elysium and all that poets feign of bliss and joy why do we linger thus i cannot rest until the white rose that i wear be dyed even in the lukewarm blood of henry's heart ay with five hundred father for a need a woman's general what should we fear i cannot joy until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become i saw him in the battle range about and watched him how he singled clifford forth methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompassed round with dogs who having pinched a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him so fared our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles it the prime of youth trimmed like a younker prancing to his love three glorious suns each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds but severed in a pale clear shining sky see see they join embrace and seem to kiss as if they vowed some league inviolable now are they but one lamp one light one sun in this the heaven figures some event nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it you love the breeder better than the male but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue say how he died for i will hear it all i cannot weep for all my body's moisture scarce serves to quench my furnace burning heart nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden for selfsame wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast and burns me up with flames that tears would quench to weep is to make less the depth of grief tears then for babes blows and revenge for me richard i bear thy name i'll venge thy death or die renown\u00e8d by attempting it nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say either that is thine or else thou wert not his great lord of warwick if we should recount our baleful news and at each word's deliverance stab poniards in our flesh till all were told the words would add more anguish than the wounds o valiant lord the duke of york is slain 'twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled oft have i heard his praises in pursuit but ne'er till now his scandal of retire i know it well lord warwick blame me not 'tis love i bear thy glories make me speak but in this troublous time what's to be done shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns numb'ring our ave marys with our beads or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms if for the last say ay and to it lords ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day that cries retire if warwick bid him stay then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds i come to pierce it or to give thee mine are you there butcher o i cannot speak 'twas you that killed young rutland was it not for god's sake lords give signal to the fight northumberland i hold thee reverently  break off the parley for scarce i can refrain the execution of my big swoll'n heart upon that clifford that cruel child killer ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland but ere sunset i'll make thee curse the deed then executioner unsheathe thy sword by him that made us all i am resolved that clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue whoever got thee there thy mother stands for well i wot thou hast thy mother's tongue iron of naples hid with english gilt whose father bears the title of a king as if a channel should be called the sea sham'st thou not knowing whence thou art extraught to let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk broached with the steely point of clifford's lance and in the very pangs of death he cried like to a dismal clangor heard from far warwick revenge brother revenge my death so underneath the belly of their steeds that stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood the noble gentleman gave up the ghost brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick let me embrace thee in my weary arms i that did never weep now melt with woe that winter should cut off our springtime so now clifford i have singled thee alone suppose this arm is for the duke of york and this for rutland both bound to revenge wert thou environed with a brazen wall nay warwick single out some other chase for i myself will hunt this wolf to death whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave a deadly groan like life and death's departing revoke that doom of mercy for 'tis clifford who not contented that he lopped the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth but set his murd'ring knife unto the root from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring i mean our princely father duke of york o would he did and so perhaps he doth 'tis but his policy to counterfeit because he would avoid such bitter taunts which in the time of death he gave our father clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace thou didst love york and i am son to york what not an oath nay then the world goes hard when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath i know by that he's dead and by my soul if this right hand would buy but two hours' life that i in all despite might rail at him this hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstaunch\u00e8d thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester for gloucester's dukedom is too ominous your highness shall do well to grant her suit it were dishonor to deny it her yea is it so i see the lady hath a thing to grant before the king will grant her humble suit silence ay widow then i'll warrant you all your lands an if what pleases him shall pleasure you fight closer or good faith you'll catch a blow god forbid that for he'll take vantages nay then whip me he'll rather give her two you shall have four if you'll be ruled by him ay good leave have you for you will have leave till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch he plies her hard and much rain wears the marble the match is made she seals it with a cursy the widow likes him not she knits her brows the ghostly father now hath done his shrift the widow likes it not for she looks very sad that would be ten days' wonder at the least by so much is the wonder in extremes ay edward will use women honorably would he were wasted marrow bones and all  that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for and yet between my soul's desire and me the lustful edward's title buri\u00e8d is clarence henry and his son young edward and all the unlooked for issue of their bodies to take their rooms ere i can place myself a cold premeditation for my purpose why then i do but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a far off shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying he'll lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say i'll cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities my eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford i'll make my heaven in a lady's lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and 'witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns why love forswore me in my mother's womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a withered shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlicked bear whelp that carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be beloved o monstrous fault to harbor such a thought then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to check to o'erbear such as are of better person than myself i'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live t' account this world but hell until my misshaped trunk that bears this head be round impal\u00e8d with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and i like one lost in a thorny wood that rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murder whiles i smile and cry content to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions i'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall i'll slay more gazers than the basilisk i'll play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slyly than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colors to the chameleon change shapes with proteus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this and cannot get a crown tut were it farther off i'll pluck it down now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice and his well chosen bride and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well not i no god forbid

the world with my legs forward had i not reason think you to make haste and seek their ruin that usurped our right the midwife wondered and the women cried o jesus bless us he is born with teeth and so i was which plainly signified that i should snarl and bite and play the dog then since the heavens have shaped my body so let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it i have no brother i am like no

the love o' th' people yea i' th' selfsame state stands many a father with his child some comfort we have by so considering we expire and not without men's pity to live still have their good wishes we prevent the loathsome misery of age beguile the gout and rheum that in lag hours attend for gray approachers we come towards the gods young and unwappered not halting under crimes many and stale that

to go my master calls me i must not say no", "JC_Cassius": "fellow come from the throng look upon caesar will you go see the order of the course i pray you do brutus i do observe you now of late i have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as i was wont to have you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you then brutus i have much mistook your passion by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value worthy cogitations tell me good brutus can you see your face 'tis just and it is very much lamented brutus that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow i have heard where many of the best respect in rome except immortal caesar speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this age's yoke have wished that noble brutus had his eyes therefore good brutus be prepared to hear and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection i your glass will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of and be not jealous on me gentle brutus were i a common laughter or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout then hold me dangerous ay do you fear it then must i think you would not have it so i know that virtue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward favor well honor is the subject of my story i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life but for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winter's cold as well as he for once upon a raw and gusty day the troubled tiber chafing with her shores caesar said to me dar'st thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point upon the word accoutered as i was i plung\u00e8d in and bade him follow so indeed he did the torrent roared and we did buffet it with lusty sinews throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy but ere we could arrive the point proposed caesar cried help me cassius or i sink i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake 'tis true this god did shake his coward lips did from their color fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his luster i did hear him groan ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books alas it cried give me some drink titinius as a sick girl you gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves men at some time are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar why should that name be sounded more than yours write them together yours is as fair a name sound them it doth become the mouth as well weigh them it is as heavy conjure with 'em brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar now in the names of all the gods at once upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great age thou art shamed rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods when went there by an age since the great flood but it was famed with more than with one man when could they say till now that talked of rome that her wide walks encompassed but one man now is it rome indeed and room enough when there is in it but one only man o you and i have heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would have brooked th' eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve and he will after his sour fashion tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today casca will tell us what the matter is they shouted thrice what was the last cry for who offered him the crown but soft i pray you what did caesar swoon no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the falling sickness did cicero say anything to what effect will you sup with me tonight casca will you dine with me tomorrow good i will expect you so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite i will do so till then think of the world well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honorable mettle may be wrought from that it is disposed therefore it is meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes for who so firm that cannot be seduced caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humor me i will this night in several hands in at his windows throw as if they came from several citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesar's ambition shall be glanc\u00e8d at and after this let caesar seat him sure for we will shake him or worse days endure who's there casca by your voice a very pleasing night to honest men those that have known the earth so full of faults for my part i have walked about the streets submitting me unto the perilous night and thus unbrac\u00e8d casca as you see have bared my bosom to the thunder stone and when the cross blue lightning seemed to open the breast of heaven i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it you are dull casca and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want or else you use not you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from quality and kind why old men fools and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and preform\u00e8d faculties to monstrous quality why you shall find that heaven hath infused them with these spirits to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunders lightens opens graves and roars as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruptions are let it be who it is for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors but woe the while our fathers' minds are dead and we are governed with our mothers' spirits our yoke and sufferance show us womanish i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein you gods you make the weak most strong therein you gods you tyrants do defeat nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure and why should caesar be a tyrant then poor man i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep he were no lion were not romans hinds those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar but o grief where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made but i am armed and dangers are to me indifferent there's a bargain made now know you casca i have moved already some certain of the noblest minded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honorable dangerous consequence and i do know by this they stay for me in pompey's porch for now this fearful night there is no stir or walking in the streets and the complexion of the element in favor 's like the work we have in hand most bloody fiery and most terrible 'tis cinna i do know him by his gait he is a friend cinna where haste you so no it is casca one incorporate to our attempts am i not stayed for cinna am i not stayed for tell me be you content good cinna take this paper and look you lay it in the praetor's chair where brutus may but find it and throw this in at his window set this up with wax upon old brutus' statue all this done repair to pompey's porch where you shall find us is decius brutus and trebonius there that done repair to pompey's theater come casca you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house three parts of him is ours already and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited let us go for it is after midnight and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him i think we are too bold upon your rest good morrow brutus do we trouble you yes every man of them and no man here but honors you and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you this is trebonius this decius brutus this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber shall i entreat a word and let us swear our resolution but what of cicero shall we sound him i think he will stand very strong with us then leave him out decius well urged i think it is not meet mark antony so well beloved of caesar should outlive caesar we shall find of him a shrewd contriver and you know his means if he improve them may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent let antony and caesar fall together yet i fear him for in the engrafted love he bears to caesar  the clock hath stricken three but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth today or no for he is superstitious grown of late quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies it may be these apparent prodigies the unaccustomed terror of this night and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitol today nay we will all of us be there to fetch him the morning comes upon 's we'll leave you brutus and friends disperse yourselves but all remember what you have said and show yourselves true romans what urge you your petitions in the street come to the capitol what enterprise popilius he wished today our enterprise might thrive i fear our purpose is discover\u00e8d casca be sudden for we fear prevention  brutus what shall be done if this be known cassius or caesar never shall turn back for i will slay myself trebonius knows his time for look you brutus he draws mark antony out of the way pardon caesar caesar pardon as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber some to the common pulpits and cry out liberty freedom and enfranchisement and leave us publius lest that the people rushing on us should do your age some mischief where is antony stoop then and wash how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown so oft as that shall be so often shall the knot of us be called the men that gave their country liberty ay every man away brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome i wish we may but yet have i a mind that fears him much and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose your voice shall be as strong as any man's in the disposing of new dignities mark antony  i blame you not for praising caesar so but what compact mean you to have with us will you be pricked in number of our friends or shall we on and not depend on you brutus a word with you you know not what you do do not consent that antony speak in his funeral know you how much the people may be moved by that which he will utter i know not what may fall i like it not stand ho most noble brother you have done me wrong brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs and when you do them  pindarus bid our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground that you have wronged me doth appear in this you have condemned and noted lucius pella for taking bribes here of the sardians wherein my letters praying on his side because i knew the man was slighted off in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offense should bear his comment i an itching palm you know that you are brutus that speaks this or by the gods this speech were else your last chastisement brutus bait not me i'll not endure it you forget yourself to hedge me in i am a soldier i older in practice abler than yourself to make conditions i am urge me no more i shall forget myself have mind upon your health tempt me no farther is 't possible o you gods you gods must i endure all this is it come to this you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus i said an elder soldier not a better did i say better when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me i durst not what durst not tempt him do not presume too much upon my love i may do that i shall be sorry for i denied you not i did not he was but a fool that brought my answer back brutus hath rived my heart a friend should bear his friend's infirmities but brutus makes mine greater than they are you love me not a friendly eye could never see such faults come antony and young octavius come revenge yourselves alone on cassius for cassius is aweary of the world  hated by one he loves braved by his brother checked like a bondman all his faults observed set in a notebook learned and conned by rote to cast into my teeth o i could weep my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger and here my naked breast within a heart dearer than pluto's mine richer than gold if that thou be'st a roman take it forth i that denied thee gold will give my heart strike as thou didst at caesar for i know when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius hath cassius lived to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus when grief and blood ill tempered vexeth him do you confess so much give me your hand o brutus have not you love enough to bear with me when that rash humor which my mother gave me makes me forgetful how now what's the matter ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme bear with him brutus 'tis his fashion away away be gone and come yourselves and bring messala with you immediately to us i did not think you could have been so angry of your philosophy you make no use if you give place to accidental evils ha portia how 'scaped i killing when i crossed you so o insupportable and touching loss upon what sickness and died so o you immortal gods my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge  fill lucius till the wine o'erswell the cup i cannot drink too much of brutus' love portia art thou gone cicero one i have as much of this in art as you but yet my nature could not bear it so i do not think it good this it is 'tis better that the enemy seek us so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers doing himself offense whilst we lying still are full of rest defense and nimbleness hear me good brother  then with your will go on we'll along ourselves and meet them at philippi no more good night early tomorrow will we rise and hence o my dear brother this was an ill beginning of the night never come such division 'tween our souls let it not brutus good night my lord stand fast titinius we must out and talk antony the posture of your blows are yet unknown but for your words they rob the hybla bees and leave them honeyless flatterers now brutus thank yourself this tongue had not offended so today if cassius might have ruled a peevish schoolboy worthless of such honor joined with a masker and a reveler why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark the storm is up and all is on the hazard messala messala this is my birthday as this very day was cassius born give me thy hand messala be thou my witness that against my will as pompey was am i compelled to set upon one battle all our liberties you know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion now i change my mind and partly credit things that do presage coming from sardis on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell and there they perched gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands who to philippi here consorted us this morning are they fled away and gone and in their steads do ravens crows and kites fly o'er our heads and downward look on us as we were sickly prey their shadows seem a canopy most fatal under which our army lies ready to give up the ghost i but believe it partly for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly now most noble brutus the gods today stand friendly that we may lovers in peace lead on our days to age but since the affairs of men rests still incertain let's reason with the worst that may befall if we do lose this battle then is this the very last time we shall speak together what are you then determin\u00e8d to do then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome forever and forever farewell brutus if we do meet again we'll smile indeed if not 'tis true this parting was well made o look titinius look the villains fly myself have to mine own turned enemy this ensign here of mine was turning back i slew the coward and did take it from him this hill is far enough look look titinius are those my tents where i perceive the fire titinius if thou lovest me mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again that i may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy go pindarus get higher on that hill my sight was ever thick regard titinius and tell me what thou not'st about the field this day i breath\u00e8d first time is come round and where i did begin there shall i end my life is run his compass sirrah what news what news come down behold no more  o coward that i am to live so long to see my best friend ta'en before my face come hither sirrah in parthia did i take thee prisoner and then i swore thee saving of thy life that whatsoever i did bid thee do thou shouldst attempt it come now keep thine oath now be a freeman and with this good sword that ran through caesar's bowels search this bosom stand not to answer here take thou the hilts and when my face is covered as 'tis now guide thou the sword caesar thou art revenged even with the sword that killed thee", "3H6_HenryVI": "my lords look where the sturdy rebel sits even in the chair of state belike he means backed by the power of warwick that false peer to aspire unto the crown and reign as king earl of northumberland he slew thy father and thine lord clifford and you both have vowed revenge on him his sons his favorites and his friends be patient gentle earl of westmorland ah know you not the city favors them and they have troops of soldiers at their beck far be the thought of this from henry's heart to make a shambles of the parliament house cousin of exeter frowns words and threats shall be the war that henry means to use  thou factious duke of york descend my throne and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet i am thy sovereign and shall i stand and thou sit in my throne what title hast thou traitor to the crown thy father was as thou art duke of york thy grandfather roger mortimer earl of march i am the son of henry the fifth who made the dauphin and the french to stoop and seized upon their towns and provinces the lord protector lost it and not i when i was crowned i was but nine months old peace thou and give king henry leave to speak think'st thou that i will leave my kingly throne wherein my grandsire and my father sat no first shall war unpeople this my realm ay and their colors often borne in france and now in england to our heart's great sorrow shall be my winding sheet why faint you lords my title's good and better far than his henry the fourth by conquest got the crown i know not what to say my title's weak  tell me may not a king adopt an heir an if he may then am i lawful king for richard in the view of many lords resigned the crown to henry the fourth whose heir my father was and i am his art thou against us duke of exeter all will revolt from me and turn to him o clifford how thy words revive my heart my lord of warwick hear but one word let me for this my lifetime reign as king i am content richard plantagenet enjoy the kingdom after my decease ah exeter not for myself lord warwick but my son whom i unnaturally shall disinherit but be it as it may i here entail the crown to thee and to thine heirs forever conditionally that here thou take an oath to cease this civil war and whilst i live to honor me as thy king and sovereign and neither by treason nor hostility to seek to put me down and reign thyself and long live thou and these thy forward sons and i with grief and sorrow to the court exeter so will i be patient gentle queen and i will stay pardon me margaret pardon me sweet son the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me stay gentle margaret and hear me speak gentle son edward thou wilt stay with me poor queen how love to me and to her son hath made her break out into terms of rage revenged may she be on that hateful duke whose haughty spirit wing\u00e8d with desire will cost my crown and like an empty eagle tire on the flesh of me and of my son the loss of those three lords torments my heart i'll write unto them and entreat them fair come cousin you shall be the messenger ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack to see this sight it irks my very soul withhold revenge dear god 'tis not my fault nor wittingly have i infringed my vow full well hath clifford played the orator inferring arguments of mighty force but clifford tell me didst thou never hear that things ill got had ever bad success and happy always was it for that son whose father for his hoarding went to hell i'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind and would my father had left me no more for all the rest is held at such a rate as brings a thousandfold more care to keep than in possession any jot of pleasure ah cousin york would thy best friends did know how it doth grieve me that thy head is here edward plantagenet arise a knight and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right why that's my fortune too therefore i'll stay have done with words my lords and hear me speak i prithee give no limits to my tongue i am a king and privileged to speak this battle fares like to the morning's war when dying clouds contend with growing light what time the shepherd blowing of his nails can neither call it perfect day nor night now sways it this way like a mighty sea forced by the tide to combat with the wind now sways it that way like the selfsame sea forced to retire by fury of the wind sometime the flood prevails and then the wind now one the better then another best both tugging to be victors breast to breast yet neither conqueror nor conquer\u00e8d so is the equal poise of this fell war here on this molehill will i sit me down to whom god will there be the victory for margaret my queen and clifford too have chid me from the battle swearing both they prosper best of all when i am thence would i were dead if god's good will were so for what is in this world but grief and woe o god methinks it were a happy life to be no better than a homely swain to sit upon a hill as i do now to carve out dials quaintly point by point thereby to see the minutes how they run how many makes the hour full complete how many hours brings about the day how many days will finish up the year how many years a mortal man may live when this is known then to divide the times so many hours must i tend my flock so many hours must i take my rest so many hours must i contemplate so many hours must i sport myself so many days my ewes have been with young so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean so many years ere i shall shear the fleece so minutes hours days months and years passed over to the end they were created would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade to shepherds looking on their silly sheep than doth a rich embroidered canopy to kings that fear their subjects' treachery o yes it doth a thousandfold it doth and to conclude the shepherd's homely curds his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle his wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade all which secure and sweetly he enjoys is far beyond a prince's delicates  his viands sparkling in a golden cup his body couch\u00e8d in a curious bed  when care mistrust and treason waits on him o piteous spectacle o bloody times whiles lions war and battle for their dens poor harmless lambs abide their enmity weep wretched man i'll aid thee tear for tear and let our hearts and eyes like civil war be blind with tears and break o'ercharged with grief woe above woe grief more than common grief o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds o pity pity gentle heaven pity the red rose and the white are on his face the fatal colors of our striving houses the one his purple blood right well resembles the other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth wither one rose and let the other flourish if you contend a thousand lives must wither how will the country for these woeful chances misthink the king and not be satisfied was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe much is your sorrow mine ten times so much sad hearted men much overgone with care here sits a king more woeful than you are nay take me with thee good sweet exeter not that i fear to stay but love to go whither the queen intends forward away from scotland am i stol'n even of pure love to greet mine own land with my wishful sight no harry harry 'tis no land of thine thy place is filled thy scepter wrung from thee thy balm washed off wherewith thou wast anointed no bending knee will call thee caesar now no humble suitors press to speak for right no not a man comes for redress of thee for how can i help them an not myself let me embrace the sour adversaries for wise men say it is the wisest course my queen and son are gone to france for aid and as i hear the great commanding warwick is thither gone to crave the french king's sister to wife for edward if this news be true poor queen and son your labor is but lost for warwick is a subtle orator and lewis a prince soon won with moving words by this account then margaret may win him for she's a woman to be pitied much her sighs will make a batt'ry in his breast her tears will pierce into a marble heart the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn and nero will be tainted with remorse to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears ay but she's come to beg warwick to give she on his left side craving aid for henry he on his right asking a wife for edward she weeps and says her henry is deposed he smiles and says his edward is installed that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong inferreth arguments of mighty strength and in conclusion wins the king from her with promise of his sister and what else to strengthen and support king edward's place o margaret thus 'twill be and thou poor soul art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn more than i seem and less than i was born to a man at least for less i should not be and men may talk of kings and why not i why so i am in mind and that's enough my crown is in my heart not on my head not decked with diamonds and indian stones nor to be seen my crown is called content a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy but did you never swear and break an oath where did you dwell when i was king of england i was anointed king at nine months old my father and my grandfather were kings and you were sworn true subjects unto me and tell me then have you not broke your oaths why am i dead do i not breathe a man ah simple men you know not what you swear look as i blow this feather from my face and as the air blows it to me again obeying with my wind when i do blow and yielding to another when it blows commanded always by the greater gust such is the lightness of you common men but do not break your oaths for of that sin my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty go where you will the king shall be commanded and be you kings command and i'll obey so would you be again to henry if he were seated as king edward is in god's name lead your king's name be obeyed and what god will that let your king perform and what he will i humbly yield unto master lieutenant now that god and friends have shaken edward from the regal seat and turned my captive state to liberty my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys at our enlargement what are thy due fees for what lieutenant for well using me nay be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure ay such a pleasure as encag\u00e8d birds conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty  but warwick after god thou sett'st me free and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee he was the author thou the instrument therefore that i may conquer fortune's spite by living low where fortune cannot hurt me and that the people of this bless\u00e8d land may not be punished with my thwarting stars warwick although my head still wear the crown i here resign my government to thee for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds warwick and clarence give me both your hands now join your hands and with your hands your hearts that no dissension hinder government i make you both protectors of this land while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion spend my latter days to sin's rebuke and my creator's praise but with the first of all your chief affairs let me entreat for i command no more  that margaret your queen and my son edward be sent for to return from france with speed for till i see them here by doubtful fear my joy of liberty is half eclipsed my lord of somerset what youth is that of whom you seem to have so tender care come hither england's hope if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts this pretty lad will prove our country's bliss his looks are full of peaceful majesty his head by nature framed to wear a crown his hand to wield a scepter and himself likely in time to bless a regal throne make much of him my lords for this is he must help you more than you are hurt by me let's levy men and beat him back again farewell my hector and my troy's true hope well minded clarence be thou fortunate sweet oxford and my loving montague and all at once once more a happy farewell here at the palace will i rest awhile cousin of exeter what thinks your lordship methinks the power that edward hath in field should not be able to encounter mine that's not my fear my meed hath got me fame i have not stopped mine ears to their demands nor posted off their suits with slow delays my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds my mildness hath allayed their swelling griefs my mercy dried their water flowing tears i have not been desirous of their wealth nor much oppressed them with great subsidies nor forward of revenge though they much erred then why should they love edward more than me no exeter these graces challenge grace and when the lion fawns upon the lamb the lamb will never cease to follow him ay my good lord my lord i should say rather 'tis sin to flatter good was little better good gloucester and good devil were alike and both preposterous therefore not good lord so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece and next his throat unto the butcher's knife what scene of death hath roscius now to act the bird that hath been lim\u00e8d in a bush with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush and i the hapless male to one sweet bird have now the fatal object in my eye where my poor young was limed was caught and killed i daedalus my poor boy icarus thy father minos that denied our course the sun that seared the wings of my sweet boy thy brother edward and thyself the sea whose envious gulf did swallow up his life ah kill me with thy weapon not with words my breast can better brook thy dagger's point than can my ears that tragic history but wherefore dost thou come is 't for my life a persecutor i am sure thou art if murdering innocents be executing why then thou art an executioner hadst thou been killed when first thou didst presume thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine and thus i prophesy that many a thousand which now mistrust no parcel of my fear and many an old man's sigh and many a widow's and many an orphan's water standing eye men for their sons wives for their husbands orphans for their parents' timeless death shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born the owl shrieked at thy birth an evil sign the night crow cried aboding luckless time dogs howled and hideous tempest shook down trees the raven rooked her on the chimney's top and chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung thy mother felt more than a mother's pain and yet brought forth less than a mother's hope to wit an indigested and deform\u00e8d lump not like the fruit of such a goodly tree teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born to signify thou cam'st to bite the world and if the rest be true which i have heard thou cam'st  ay and for much more slaughter after this o god forgive my sins and pardon thee", "Tmp_Prospero": "be collected no more amazement tell your piteous heart there's no harm done no harm i have done nothing but in care of thee of thee my dear one thee my daughter who art ignorant of what thou art naught knowing of whence i am nor that i am more better than prospero master of a full poor cell and thy no greater father 'tis time i should inform thee farther lend thy hand and pluck my magic garment from me so lie there my art wipe thou thine eyes have comfort the direful spectacle of the wrack which touched the very virtue of compassion in thee i have with such provision in mine art so safely ordered that there is no soul  no not so much perdition as an hair betid to any creature in the vessel which thou heard'st cry which thou saw'st sink sit down for thou must now know farther the hour's now come the very minute bids thee ope thine ear obey and be attentive canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell i do not think thou canst for then thou wast not out three years old by what by any other house or person of anything the image tell me that hath kept with thy remembrance thou hadst and more miranda but how is it that this lives in thy mind what seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time if thou rememb'rest aught ere thou cam'st here how thou cam'st here thou mayst twelve year since miranda twelve year since thy father was the duke of milan and a prince of power thy mother was a piece of virtue and she said thou wast my daughter and thy father was duke of milan and his only heir and princess no worse issued both both my girl by foul play as thou sayst were we heaved thence but blessedly holp hither my brother and thy uncle called antonio  i pray thee mark me that a brother should be so perfidious he whom next thyself of all the world i loved and to him put the manage of my state as at that time through all the signories it was the first and prospero the prime duke being so reputed in dignity and for the liberal arts without a parallel those being all my study the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger being transported and rapt in secret studies thy false uncle  dost thou attend me being once perfected how to grant suits how to deny them who t' advance and who to trash for overtopping new created the creatures that were mine i say or changed 'em or else new formed 'em having both the key of officer and office set all hearts i' th' state to what tune pleased his ear that now he was the ivy which had hid my princely trunk and sucked my verdure out on 't thou attend'st not i pray thee mark me i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which but by being so retired o'erprized all popular rate in my false brother awaked an evil nature and my trust like a good parent did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was which had indeed no limit a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded not only with what my revenue yielded but what my power might else exact like one who having into truth by telling of it made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie he did believe he was indeed the duke out o' th' substitution and executing th' outward face of royalty with all prerogative hence his ambition growing  dost thou hear to have no screen between this part he played and him he played it for he needs will be absolute milan me poor man my library was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable confederates so dry he was for sway wi' th' king of naples to give him annual tribute do him homage subject his coronet to his crown and bend the dukedom yet unbowed alas poor milan  to most ignoble stooping mark his condition and th' event then tell me if this might be a brother now the condition this king of naples being an enemy to me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit which was that he in lieu o' th' premises of homage and i know not how much tribute should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair milan with all the honors on my brother whereon a treacherous army levied one midnight fated to th' purpose did antonio open the gates of milan and i' th' dead of darkness the ministers for th' purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self hear a little further and then i'll bring thee to the present business which now 's upon 's without the which this story were most impertinent well demanded wench my tale provokes that question dear they durst not so dear the love my people bore me nor set a mark so bloody on the business but with colors fairer painted their foul ends in few they hurried us aboard a bark bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared a rotten carcass of a butt not rigged nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats instinctively have quit it there they hoist us to cry to th' sea that roared to us to sigh to th' winds whose pity sighing back again did us but loving wrong o a cherubin thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile infus\u00e8d with a fortitude from heaven when i have decked the sea with drops full salt under my burden groaned which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue by providence divine some food we had and some fresh water that a noble neapolitan gonzalo out of his charity who being then appointed master of this design did give us with rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries which since have steaded much so of his gentleness knowing i loved my books he furnished me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my dukedom now i arise sit still and hear the last of our sea sorrow here in this island we arrived and here have i thy schoolmaster made thee more profit than other princes can that have more time for vainer hours and tutors not so careful know thus far forth by accident most strange bountiful fortune now my dear lady hath mine enemies brought to this shore and by my prescience i find my zenith doth depend upon a most auspicious star whose influence if now i court not but omit my

unmitigable rage into a cloven pine within which rift imprisoned thou didst painfully remain a dozen years within which space she died and left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans as fast as mill wheels strike then was this island save for the son that she did litter here a freckled whelp hag born not honored with a human shape dull thing i say so he that caliban whom now i keep in service thou best know'st what torment i did find thee in thy groans did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts of ever angry bears it was a torment to lay upon the damned which sycorax could not

departing bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou performed my ariel a grace it had devouring of my instruction hast thou nothing bated in what thou hadst to say so with good life and observation strange my meaner ministers their several kinds have done my high charms work and these mine enemies are all knit up in their distractions they now are in my power and in these fits i leave them while i visit young ferdinand whom they suppose is drowned and his and mine loved darling if i have too austerely punished you your compensation makes amends for i have given you here a third of mine own life or that for which i live who once again i tender to thy hand all thy vexations were but my trials of thy love and thou hast strangely stood the test here afore heaven i ratify this my rich gift o ferdinand do not smile at me that i boast of her for thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise and make it halt behind her then as my gift and thine own acquisition worthily purchased take my daughter but if thou dost break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite be ministered no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall to make this contract grow but barren hate sour eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew the union of your bed with weeds so loathly that you shall hate it both therefore take heed as hymen's lamps shall light you fairly spoke sit then and talk with her she is thine own what ariel my industrious servant ariel thou and thy meaner fellows your last service did worthily perform and i must use you in such another trick go bring

from me ay with a twink dearly my delicate ariel do not approach till thou dost hear me call look thou be true do not give dalliance too much the rein the strongest oaths are straw to th' fire i' th' blood be more abstemious or else goodnight your vow well  now come my ariel bring a corollary rather than want a spirit appear and pertly no tongue all eyes be silent spirits which by mine art i have from their confines called to enact my present fancies sweet now silence juno and ceres whisper seriously there's something else to do hush and be mute or else our spell is marred i had forgot that foul conspiracy of the beast caliban and his confederates against my life the minute of their plot is almost come well done avoid no more you do look my son in a moved sort as if you were dismayed be cheerful sir our revels now are ended these our actors as i foretold you were all spirits and are melted into air into thin air and like the baseless fabric of this vision the cloud capped towers the gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself yea all which it inherit shall dissolve and like this insubstantial pageant faded leave not a rack behind we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep sir i am vexed bear with my weakness my old brain is troubled be not disturbed with my infirmity if you be pleased retire into my cell and there repose a turn or two i'll walk to still my beating mind come with a thought i thank thee ariel come spirit we must prepare to meet with caliban say again where didst thou leave these varlets this was well done my bird thy shape invisible retain thou still the trumpery in my house go bring it hither for stale to catch these thieves a devil a born devil on whose nature nurture can never stick on whom my pains humanely taken all all lost quite lost and as with age his body uglier grows so his mind cankers i will plague them all even to roaring come hang them on this line hey mountain hey fury fury there tyrant there hark hark go charge my goblins that they grind their joints with dry convulsions shorten up their sinews with ag\u00e8d cramps and more pinch spotted make them than pard or cat o' mountain let them be hunted soundly at this hour lies at my mercy all mine enemies shortly shall all my labors end and thou shalt have the air at freedom for a little follow and do me service now does my project gather to a head my charms crack not my spirits obey and time goes upright with his carriage how's the day i did say so when first i raised the tempest say my spirit how fares the king and 's followers dost thou think so spirit and mine shall hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling of their afflictions and shall not myself one of their kind that relish all as sharply passion as they be kindlier moved than thou art though with their high wrongs i am struck to th' quick yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury do i take part the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent the sole drift of my purpose doth extend not a frown further go release them ariel my charms i'll break their senses i'll restore and they shall be themselves you elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves and you that on the sands with printless foot do chase the ebbing neptune and do fly him when he comes back you demi puppets that by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime is to make midnight mushrumps that rejoice to hear the solemn curfew by whose aid weak masters though you be i have bedimmed the noontide sun called forth the mutinous winds and 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder have i given fire and rifted jove's stout oak with his own bolt the strong based promontory have i made shake and by the spurs plucked up the pine and cedar graves at my command have waked their sleepers oped and let 'em forth by my so potent art but this rough magic i here abjure and when i have required some heavenly music which even now i do to work mine end upon their senses that this airy charm is for i'll break my staff bury it certain fathoms in the earth and deeper than did ever plummet sound i'll drown my book a solemn air and the best comforter to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains now useless boiled within thy skull there stand for you are spell stopped  holy gonzalo honorable man mine eyes e'en sociable to the show of thine fall fellowly drops the charm dissolves apace and as the morning steals upon the night melting the darkness so their rising senses begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle their clearer reason o good gonzalo my true preserver and a loyal sir to him thou follow'st i will pay thy graces home both in word and deed most cruelly didst thou alonso use me and my daughter thy brother was a furtherer in the act  thou art pinched for 't now sebastian flesh and blood you brother mine that entertained ambition expelled remorse and nature whom with sebastian whose inward pinches therefore are most strong would here have killed your king i do forgive thee unnatural though thou art their understanding begins to swell and the approaching tide will shortly fill the reasonable shore that now lies foul and muddy not one of them that yet looks on me or would know me ariel fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell i will discase me and myself present as i was sometime milan quickly spirit thou shalt ere long be free why that's my dainty ariel i shall miss thee but yet thou shalt have freedom so so so to the king's ship invisible as thou art there shalt thou find the mariners asleep under the hatches the master and the boatswain being awake enforce them to this place and presently i prithee behold sir king the wrong\u00e8d duke of milan prospero for more assurance that a living prince does now speak to thee i embrace thy body and to thee and thy company i bid a hearty welcome first noble friend let me embrace thine age whose honor cannot be measured or confined you do yet taste some subtleties o' th' isle that will not let you believe things certain welcome my friends all but you my brace of lords were i so minded i here could pluck his highness' frown upon you and justify you traitors at this time i will tell no tales no for you most wicked sir whom to call brother would even infect my mouth i do forgive thy rankest fault all of them and require my dukedom of thee which perforce i know thou must restore i am woe for 't sir i rather think you have not sought her help of whose soft grace for the like loss i have her sovereign aid and rest myself content as great to me as late and supportable to make the dear loss have i means much weaker than you may call to comfort you for i have lost my daughter in this last tempest i perceive these lords at this encounter do so much admire that they devour their reason and scarce think their eyes do offices of truth their words are natural breath but howsoe'er you have been justled from your senses know for certain that i am prospero and that very duke which was thrust forth of milan who most strangely upon this shore where you were wracked was landed to be the lord on 't no more yet of this for 'tis a chronicle of day by day not a relation for a breakfast nor befitting this first meeting welcome sir this cell's my court here have i few attendants and subjects none abroad pray you look in my dukedom since you have given me again i will requite you with as good a thing at least bring forth a wonder to content you as much as me my dukedom 'tis new to thee there sir stop let us not burden our remembrances with a heaviness that's gone my tricksy spirit bravely my diligence thou shalt be free sir my liege do not infest your mind with beating on the strangeness of this business at picked leisure which shall be shortly single i'll resolve you which to you shall seem probable of every these happened accidents till when be cheerful and think of each thing well come hither spirit set caliban and his companions free untie the spell how fares my gracious sir there are yet missing of your company some few odd lads that you remember not mark but the badges of these men my lords then say if they be true this misshapen knave his mother was a witch and one so strong that could control the moon make flows and ebbs and deal in her command without her power these three have robbed me and this demi devil for he's a bastard one had plotted with them to take my life two of these fellows you must know and own this thing of darkness i acknowledge mine you'd be king o' the isle sirrah he is as disproportioned in his manners as in his shape go sirrah to my cell take with you your companions as you look to have my pardon trim it handsomely go to away sir i invite your highness and your train to my poor cell where you shall take your rest for this one night which part of it i'll waste with such discourse as i not doubt shall make it go quick away the story of my life and the particular accidents gone by since i came to this isle and in the morn i'll bring you to your ship and so to naples where i have hope to see the nuptial of these our dear belov\u00e8d solemnized and thence retire me to my milan where every third thought shall be my grave i'll deliver all and promise you calm seas auspicious gales and sail so expeditious that shall catch your royal fleet far off my ariel chick that is thy charge then to the elements be free and fare thou well please you draw near now my charms are all o'erthrown and what strength i have 's mine own which is most faint now 'tis true i must be here confined by you or sent to naples let me not since i have my dukedom got and pardoned the deceiver dwell in this bare island by your spell but release me from my bands with the help of your good hands gentle breath of yours my sails must fill or else my project fails which was to please now i want spirits to enforce art to enchant and my ending is despair unless i be relieved by prayer which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all faults as you from crimes would pardoned be let your indulgence set me free", "Oth_Iago": "'sblood but you'll not hear me if ever i did dream of such a matter abhor me despise me if i do not three great ones of the city in personal suit to make me his lieutenant off capped to him and by the faith of man i know my price i am worth no worse a place but he as loving his own pride and purposes evades them with a bombast circumstance horribly stuffed with epithets of war and in conclusion nonsuits my mediators for certes says he i have already chose my officer and what was he forsooth a great arithmetician one michael cassio a florentine a fellow almost damned in a fair wife that never set a squadron in the field nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric wherein the tog\u00e8d consuls can propose as masterly as he mere prattle without practice is all his soldiership but he sir had th' election and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds christened and heathen must be beleed and calmed by debitor and creditor this countercaster he in good time must his lieutenant be and i god bless the mark his moorship's ancient why there's no remedy 'tis the curse of service preferment goes by letter and affection and not by old gradation where each second stood heir to th' first now sir be judge yourself whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor o sir content you i follow him to serve my turn upon him we cannot all be masters nor all masters cannot be truly followed you shall mark many a duteous and knee crooking knave that doting on his own obsequious bondage wears out his time much like his master's ass for naught but provender and when he's old cashiered whip me such honest knaves others there are who trimmed in forms and visages of duty keep yet their hearts attending on themselves and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats do themselves homage these fellows have some soul and such a one do i profess myself for sir it is as sure as you are roderigo were i the moor i would not be iago in following him i follow but myself heaven is my judge not i for love and duty but seeming so for my peculiar end for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in complement extern 'tis not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at i am not what i am call up her father rouse him make after him poison his delight proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen and though he in a fertile climate dwell plague him with flies though that his joy be joy yet throw such chances of vexation on 't as it may lose some color do with like timorous accent and dire yell as when by night and negligence the fire is spied in populous cities awake what ho brabantio thieves thieves look to your house your daughter and your bags thieves thieves are your doors locked zounds sir you're robbed for shame put on your gown your heart is burst you have lost half your soul even now now very now an old black ram is tupping your white ewe arise arise awake the snorting citizens with the bell or else the devil will make a grandsire of you arise i say zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve god if the devil bid you because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians you'll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse you'll have your nephews neigh to you you'll have coursers for cousins and jennets for germans i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs you are a senator farewell for i must leave you it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place to be producted as if i stay i shall against the moor for i do know the state however this may gall him with some check cannot with safety cast him for he's embarked with such loud reason to the cyprus wars which even now stands in act that for their souls another of his fathom they have none to lead their business in which regard though i do hate him as i do hell pains yet for necessity of present life i must show out a flag and sign of love  which is indeed but sign that you shall surely find him lead to the sagittary the rais\u00e8d search and there will i be with him so farewell though in the trade of war i have slain men yet do i hold it very stuff o' th' conscience to do no contrived murder i lack iniquity sometimes to do me service nine or ten times i had thought t' have yerked him here under the ribs nay but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honor that with the little godliness i have i did full hard forbear him but i pray you sir are you fast married be assured of this that the magnifico is much beloved and hath in his effect a voice potential as double as the duke's he will divorce you or put upon you what restraint or grievance the law with all his might to enforce it on will give him cable those are the rais\u00e8d father and his friends you were best go in by janus i think no faith he tonight hath boarded a land carrack if it prove lawful prize he's made forever he's married marry to come captain will you go it is brabantio general be advised he comes to bad intent you roderigo come sir i am for you what sayst thou noble heart why go to bed and sleep if thou dost i shall never love thee after why thou silly gentleman o villainous i have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i would change my humanity with a baboon virtue a fig 'tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts  whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favor with an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy purse  nor he his to her it was a violent commencement in her and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse these moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her thou art sure of me go make money i have told thee often and i retell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this tomorrow adieu at my lodging go to farewell do you hear roderigo no more of drowning do you hear go to farewell put money enough in your purse thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gained knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets 'has done my office i know not if 't be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety he holds me well the better shall my purpose work on him cassio's a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery how how let's see after some time to abuse othello's ear that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected framed to make women false the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so and will as tenderly be led by th' nose as asses are i have 't it is engendered hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light sir would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me you would have enough in faith too much i find it still when i have list to sleep marry before your ladyship i grant she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking come on come on you are pictures out of door bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens saints in your injuries devils being offended players in your huswifery and huswives in your beds nay it is true or else i am a turk you rise to play and go to bed to work no let me not o gentle lady do not put me to 't for i am nothing if not critical ay madam i am about it but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze it plucks out brains and all but my muse labors and thus she is delivered if she be fair and wise fairness and wit the one's for use the other useth it if she be black and thereto have a wit she'll find a white that shall her blackness hit she never yet was foolish that was fair for even her folly helped her to an heir there's none so foul and foolish thereunto but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do she that was ever fair and never proud had tongue at will and yet was never loud never lacked gold and yet went never gay fled from her wish and yet said now i may she that being angered her revenge being nigh bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod's head for the salmon's tail she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind see suitors following and not look behind she was a wight if ever such wight were  to suckle fools and chronicle small beer he takes her by the palm ay well said whisper with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship you say true 'tis so indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in very good well kissed an excellent courtesy 'tis so indeed yet again your fingers to your lips would they were clyster pipes for your sake the moor i know his trumpet o you are well tuned now but i'll set down the pegs that make this music as honest as i am do thou meet me presently at the harbor come hither if thou be'st valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first i must tell thee this desdemona is directly in love with him lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed mark me with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favor sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already blessed fig's end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark that lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together villainous thoughts roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise th' incorporate conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me i have brought you from venice watch you tonight for the command i'll lay 't upon you cassio knows you not i'll not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favorably minister sir he's rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell that cassio loves her i do well believe 't that she loves him 'tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think he'll prove to desdemona a most dear husband now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leaped into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am evened with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment cannot cure which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trace for his quick hunting stand the putting on i'll have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my nightcap too make the moor thank me love me and reward me for making him egregiously an ass and practicing upon his peace and quiet even to madness 'tis here but yet confused knavery's plain face is never seen till used not this hour lieutenant 'tis not yet ten o' th' clock our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for jove and i'll warrant her full of game what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley to provocation and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love well happiness to their sheets come lieutenant i have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello o they are our friends but one cup i'll drink for you what man 'tis a night of revels the gallants desire it here at the door i pray you call them in if i can fasten but one cup upon him with that which he hath drunk tonight already he'll be as full of quarrel and offense as my young mistress' dog now my sick fool roderigo whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out to desdemona hath tonight caroused potations pottle deep and he's to watch three else of cyprus noble swelling spirits that hold their honors in a wary distance the very elements of this warlike isle have i tonight flustered with flowing cups and they watch too now 'mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the isle but here they come if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely both with wind and stream some wine ho and let me the cannikin clink clink and let me the cannikin clink a soldier's a man o man's life's but a span why then let a soldier drink some wine boys i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting your dane your german and your swag bellied hollander drink ho are nothing to your english why he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled o sweet england king stephen was and a worthy peer his breeches cost him but a crown he held them sixpence all too dear with that he called the tailor lown he was a wight of high renown and thou art but of low degree 'tis pride that pulls the country down then take thy auld cloak about thee some wine ho will you hear 't again it's true good lieutenant and so do i too lieutenant you see this fellow that is gone before he's a soldier fit to stand by caesar and give direction and do but see his vice 'tis to his virtue a just equinox the one as long as th' other 'tis pity of him i fear the trust othello puts him in on some odd time of his infirmity will shake this island 'tis evermore the prologue to his sleep he'll watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle how now roderigo i pray you after the lieutenant go not i for this fair island i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evil but hark what noise away i say go out and cry a mutiny nay good lieutenant god's will gentlemen  help ho lieutenant sir montano sir  help masters here's a goodly watch indeed who's that which rings the bell diablo ho the town will rise god's will lieutenant hold you will be shamed forever hold ho lieutenant sir montano gentlemen  have you forgot all sense of place and duty hold the general speaks to you hold for shame i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom divesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and tilting one at other's breast in opposition bloody i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offense to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamor as it so fell out  the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i returned the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till tonight i ne'er might say before when i came back  for this was brief i found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass what are you hurt lieutenant marry god forbid as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and he's yours what was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to you is 't possible why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not so befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you you or any man living may be drunk at a time man i'll tell you what you shall do our general's wife is now the general i may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch and what's he then that says i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for 'tis most easy th' inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit she's framed as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moor were 't to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeem\u00e8d sin  his soul is so enfettered to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortune and she for him pleads strongly to the moor i'll pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her body's lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all how now roderigo how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time does 't not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashiered cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by th' mass 'tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short retire thee go where thou art billeted away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress i'll set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay that's the way dull not device by coldness and delay you have not been abed then i'll send her to you presently and i'll devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way that your converse and business may be more free well my good lord i'll do 't ha i like not that nothing my lord or if i know not what cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it that he would steal away so guiltylike seeing your coming my noble lord  did michael cassio when you wooed my lady know of your love but for a satisfaction of my thought no further harm i did not think he had been acquainted with her indeed honest my lord my lord for aught i know think my lord my lord you know i love you for michael cassio i dare be sworn i think that he is honest men should be what they seem or those that be not would they might seem none why then i think cassio's an honest man good my lord pardon me though i am bound to every act of duty i am not bound to that all slaves are free to utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false  as where's that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not who has that breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and law days and in sessions sit with meditations lawful i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guess  as i confess it is my nature's plague to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy shapes faults that are not that your wisdom from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty and wisdom to let you know my thoughts good name in man and woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash 'tis something nothing 'twas mine 'tis his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed you cannot if my heart were in your hand nor shall not whilst 'tis in my custody o beware my lord of jealousy it is the green eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger but o what damn\u00e8d minutes tells he o'er who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves poor and content is rich and rich enough but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor good god the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy i am glad of this for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore as i am bound receive it from me i speak not yet of proof look to your wife observe her well with cassio wear your eyes thus not jealous nor secure i would not have your free and noble nature out of self bounty be abused look to 't i know our country disposition well in venice they do let god see the pranks they dare not show their husbands their best conscience is not to leave 't undone but keep 't unknown she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seemed to shake and fear your looks she loved them most why go to then she that so young could give out such a seeming to seel her father's eyes up close as oak he thought 'twas witchcraft but i am much to blame i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you i see this hath a little dashed your spirits i' faith i fear it has i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love but i do see you're moved i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion should you do so my lord my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aim not at cassio's my worthy friend my lord i see you're moved long live she so and long live you to think so ay there's the point as to be bold with you not to affect many propos\u00e8d matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends  foh one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproportion thoughts unnatural  but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her though i may fear her will recoiling to her better judgment may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent my lord i take my leave my lord i would i might entreat your honor to scan this thing no farther leave it to time although 'tis fit that cassio have his place  for sure he fills it up with great ability  yet if you please to hold him off awhile you shall by that perceive him and his means note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity much will be seen in that in the meantime let me be thought too busy in my fears  as worthy cause i have to fear i am  and hold her free i do beseech your honor i once more take my leave how now what do you here alone you have a thing for me it is a common thing  to have a foolish wife what handkerchief hast stol'n it from her a good wench give it me why what is that to you be not acknown on 't i have use for it go leave me i will in cassio's lodging lose this napkin and let him find it trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ this may do something the moor already changes with my poison dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons which at the first are scarce found to distaste but with a little act upon the blood burn like the mines of sulfur i did say so look where he comes not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday why how now general no more of that how now my lord i am sorry to hear this is 't possible my lord is 't come to this my noble lord  o grace o heaven forgive me are you a man have you a soul or sense god b' wi' you take mine office o wretched fool that liv'st to make thine honesty a vice  o monstrous world take note take note o world to be direct and honest is not safe  i thank you for this profit and from hence i'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense i should be wise for honesty's a fool and loses that it works for i see you are eaten up with passion i do repent me that i put it to you you would be satisfied and may but how how satisfied my lord would you the supervisor grossly gape on behold her topped it were a tedious difficulty i think to bring them to that prospect damn them then if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own what then how then what shall i say where's satisfaction it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk but yet i say if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction you might have 't i do not like the office but sith i am entered in this cause so far pricked to 't by foolish honesty and love i will go on i lay with cassio lately and being troubled with a raging tooth i could not sleep there are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs one of this kind is cassio in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona let us be wary let us hide our loves and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand cry o sweet creature then kiss me hard as if he plucked up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips then laid his leg o'er my thigh and sighed and kissed and then cried curs\u00e8d fate that gave thee to the moor nay this was but his dream and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly nay but be wise yet we see nothing done she may be honest yet tell me but this have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand i know not that but such a handkerchief  i am sure it was your wife's did i today see cassio wipe his beard with if it be that or any that was hers it speaks against her with the other proofs yet be content patience i say your mind perhaps may change do not rise yet witness you ever burning lights above you elements that clip us round about witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit hands heart to wronged othello's service let him command and to obey shall be in me remorse what bloody business ever my friend is dead 'tis done at your request but let her live i am your own forever there is no other way 'tis she must do 't and lo the happiness go and importune her is my lord angry can he be angry i have seen the cannon when it hath blown his ranks into the air and like the devil from his very arm puffed his own brother and is he angry something of moment then i will go meet him there's matter in 't indeed if he be angry will you think so what to kiss in private or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more not meaning any harm if they do nothing 'tis a venial slip but if i give my wife a handkerchief  why then 'tis hers my lord and being hers she may i think bestow 't on any man her honor is an essence that's not seen they have it very oft that have it not but for the handkerchief  ay what of that what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong or heard him say as knaves be such abroad who having by their own importunate suit or voluntary dotage of some mistress convinc\u00e8d or supplied them cannot choose but they must blab  he hath my lord but be you well assured no more than he'll unswear faith that he did i know not what he did lie  with her on her what you will work on my medicine work thus credulous fools are caught and many worthy and chaste dames even thus all guiltless meet reproach what ho my lord my lord i say othello how now cassio my lord is fall'n into an epilepsy this is his second fit he had one yesterday no forbear the lethargy must have his quiet course if not he foams at mouth and by and by breaks out to savage madness look he stirs do you withdraw yourself a little while he will recover straight when he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you how is it general have you not hurt your head i mock you not by heaven would you would bear your fortune like a man there's many a beast then in a populous city and many a civil monster good sir be a man think every bearded fellow that's but yoked may draw with you there's millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds which they dare swear peculiar your case is better o 'tis the spite of hell the fiend's arch mock to lip a wanton in a secure couch and to suppose her chaste no let me know and knowing what i am i know what she shall be stand you awhile apart confine yourself but in a patient list whilst you were here o'erwhelm\u00e8d with your grief  a passion most unsuiting such a man  cassio came hither i shifted him away and laid good 'scuses upon your ecstasy bade him anon return and here speak with me the which he promised do but encave yourself and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns that dwell in every region of his face for i will make him tell the tale anew  where how how oft how long ago and when he hath and is again to cope your wife i say but mark his gesture marry patience or i shall say you're all in all in spleen and nothing of a man that's not amiss but yet keep time in all will you withdraw now will i question cassio of bianca a huswife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature that dotes on cassio as 'tis the strumpet's plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one he when he hears of her cannot restrain from the excess of laughter here he comes as he shall smile othello shall go mad and his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassio's smiles gestures and light behaviors quite in the wrong how do you lieutenant ply desdemona well and you are sure on 't now if this suit lay in bianca's power how quickly should you speed i never knew woman love man so do you hear cassio she gives it out that you shall marry her do you intend it faith the cry goes that you marry her i am a very villain else before me look where she comes after her after her will you sup there well i may chance to see you for i would very fain speak with you go to say no more did you perceive how he laughed at his vice and did you see the handkerchief yours by this hand and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife she gave it him and he hath giv'n it his whore nay you must forget that nay that's not your way she's the worse for all this ay too gentle if you are so fond over her iniquity give her patent to offend for if it touch not you it comes near nobody o 'tis foul in her that's fouler do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even the bed she hath contaminated and for cassio let me be his undertaker you shall hear more by midnight i warrant something from venice 'tis lodovico this comes from the duke see your wife's with him i am very glad to see you signior welcome to cyprus lives sir he is much changed he's that he is i may not breathe my censure what he might be if what he might he is not i would to heaven he were 'faith that was not so well yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst alas alas it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known you shall observe him and his own courses will denote him so that i may save my speech do but go after and mark how he continues what is your pleasure madam how is 't with you what is the matter lady what name fair lady why did he so do not weep do not weep alas the day beshrew him for 't how comes this trick upon him fie there is no such man it is impossible speak within door you are a fool go to i pray you be content 'tis but his humor the business of the state does him offense and he does chide with you it is but so i warrant hark how these instruments summon to supper the messengers of venice stays the meat go in and weep not all things shall be well how now roderigo what in the contrary will you hear me roderigo you charge me most unjustly well go to very well very well you have said now why now i see there's mettle in thee and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before give me thy hand roderigo thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet i protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair i grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment but roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which i have greater reason to believe now than ever i mean purpose courage and valor this night show it if thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life sir there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othello's place o no he goes into mauritania and takes away with him the fair desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of cassio why by making him uncapable of othello's place knocking out his brains ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right he sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will i go to him he knows not yet of his honorable fortune if you will watch his going thence which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your pleasure i will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall between us come stand not amazed at it but go along with me i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him it is now high supper time and the night grows to waste about it and you shall be satisfied here stand behind this bulk straight will he come wear thy good rapier bare and put it home quick quick fear nothing i'll be at thy elbow it makes us or it mars us think on that and fix most firm thy resolution here at thy hand be bold and take thy stand i have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense and he grows angry now whether he kill cassio or cassio him or each do kill the other every way makes my gain live roderigo he calls me to a restitution large of gold and jewels that i bobbed from him as gifts to desdemona it must not be if cassio do remain he hath a daily beauty in his life that makes me ugly and besides the moor may unfold me to him there stand i in much peril no he must die be 't so i hear him coming who's there whose noise

our uncle creon clear spirited cousin let's leave his court that we may nothing share of his loud infamy for our milk will relish of the pasture and we must be vile or disobedient not his kinsmen in blood unless in quality let him approach but that we fear the gods in him he brings not a jot of terror to us yet what man thirds his own worth the case is each of ours  when that his action's dregged with mind assured 'tis bad he goes about so we must is 't said this war's afoot or it shall be on fail of some condition let th' event that never erring arbitrator tell us when we know all ourselves and let us follow the becking of our chance how do you sir i believe it and to that destiny have patiently laid up my hour to come no palamon those hopes are prisoners with us here we are and here the graces of our youths must wither like a too timely spring here age must find us and which is heaviest palamon unmarried the sweet embraces of a loving wife loaden with kisses armed with thousand cupids shall never clasp our necks no issue know us  no figures of ourselves shall we e'er see to glad our age and like young eagles teach 'em boldly to gaze against bright arms and say remember what your fathers were and conquer the fair eyed maids shall weep our banishments and in their songs curse ever blinded fortune till she for shame see what a wrong she has done to youth and nature this is all our world we shall know nothing here but one another hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes the vine shall grow but we shall never see it summer shall come and with her all delights but dead cold winter must inhabit here still yet cousin even from the bottom of these miseries from all that fortune can inflict upon us i see two comforts rising two mere blessings if the gods please to hold here a brave patience and the enjoying of our griefs together whilst palamon is with me let me perish if i think this our prison shall we make worthy uses of this place that all men hate so much let's think this prison holy sanctuary to keep us from corruption of worse men we are young and yet desire the ways of honor that liberty and common conversation the poison of pure spirits might like women woo us to wander from what worthy blessing can be but our imaginations may make it ours and here being thus together we are an endless mine to one another we are one another's wife ever begetting new births of love we are father friends acquaintance we are in one another families i am your heir and you are mine this place is our inheritance no hard oppressor dare take this from us here with a little patience we shall live long and loving no surfeits seek us the hand of war hurts none here nor the seas swallow their youth were we at liberty a wife might part us lawfully or business quarrels consume us envy of ill men crave our acquaintance i might sicken cousin where you should never know it and so perish without your noble hand to close mine eyes or prayers to the gods a thousand chances were we from hence would sever us i would hear you still sure there cannot till our deaths it cannot and after death our spirits shall be led to those that love eternally speak on

i love most and in that faith will perish as i have brought my life here to confirm it as i have served her truest worthiest as i dare kill this cousin that denies it so let me be most traitor and you please me for scorning thy edict duke ask that lady why she is fair and why her eyes command me stay here to love her and if she say traitor i am a villain fit to lie unburied no never duke 'tis worse

invent duke if she refuse me yet my grave will wed me and soldiers sing my epitaph i embrace you i am in labor to push your name your ancient love our kindred out of my memory and i' th' selfsame place to seat something i would confound so hoist we the sails that must these vessels port even where the heavenly limiter pleases one farewell farewell sir knights kinsmen lovers yea my sacrifices true worshippers of mars whose spirit in you expels the seeds of fear and th' apprehension which still is father of it go with me before the god of our profession there require of him the hearts of lions and the breath of tigers yea the fierceness too yea the speed also to go on i mean else wish we to be snails you know my prize must be dragged out of blood force and great feat must put my garland on where she sticks the queen of flowers our intercession then must be to him that makes the camp a cistern brimmed with the blood of men give me your aid and bend your spirits towards him thou mighty one that with thy power hast turned green neptune into purple whose approach comets prewarn whose havoc in vast field unearth\u00e8d skulls proclaim whose breath blows down the teeming ceres' foison who dost pluck with hand armipotent from forth blue clouds the masoned turrets that both mak'st and break'st the stony girths of cities me thy pupil youngest follower of thy drum instruct this day with military skill that to thy laud i may advance my streamer and by thee be styled the lord o' th' day give me great mars some token of thy pleasure o great corrector of enormous times shaker of o'er rank states thou grand decider of dusty and old titles that heal'st with blood the earth when it is sick and cur'st the world o' th' pleurisy of people i do take thy signs auspiciously and in thy name to my design march boldly let us go emily to buy you i have lost what's dearest to me save what is bought and yet i purchase cheaply as i do rate your value take emilia and with her all the world's joy reach thy hand farewell i have told my last hour i was false yet never treacherous forgive me cousin one kiss from fair emilia 'tis done take her i die", "Per_Pericles": "i have antiochus and with a soul emboldened with the glory of her praise think death no hazard in this enterprise see where she comes appareled like the spring graces her subjects and her thoughts the king of every virtue gives renown to men her face the book of praises where is read nothing but curious pleasures as from thence sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath could never be her mild companion you gods that made me man and sway in love that have inflamed desire in my breast to taste the fruit of yon celestial tree or die in th' adventure be my helps as i am son and servant to your will to compass such a boundless happiness that would be son to great antiochus antiochus i thank thee who hath taught my frail mortality to know itself and by those fearful objects to prepare this body like to them to what i must for death remembered should be like a mirror who tells us life's but breath to trust it error i'll make my will then and as sick men do who know the world see heaven but feeling woe gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did so i bequeath a happy peace to you and all good men as every prince should do my riches to the earth from whence they came but my unspotted fire of love to you  thus ready for the way of life or death i wait the sharpest blow like a bold champion i assume the lists nor ask advice of any other thought but faithfulness and courage i am no viper yet i feed on mother's flesh which did me breed i sought a husband in which labor i found that kindness in a father he's father son and husband mild i mother wife and yet his child how they may be and yet in two as you will live resolve it you sharp physic is the last but o you powers that gives heaven countless eyes to view men's acts why cloud they not their sights perpetually if this be true which makes me pale to read it fair glass of light i loved you and could still were not this glorious casket stored with ill but i must tell you now my thoughts revolt for he's no man on whom perfections wait that knowing sin within will touch the gate you are a fair viol and your sense the strings who fingered to make man his lawful music would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken but being played upon before your time hell only danceth at so harsh a chime good sooth i care not for you great king few love to hear the sins they love to act 'twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it who has a book of all that monarchs do he's more secure to keep it shut than shown for vice repeated is like the wand'ring wind blows dust in others' eyes to spread itself and yet the end of all is bought thus dear the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear to stop the air would hurt them the blind mole casts copped hills towards heaven to tell the earth is thronged by man's oppression and the poor worm doth die for 't kings are earth's gods in vice their law's their will and if jove stray who dares say jove doth ill it is enough you know and it is fit what being more known grows worse to smother it all love the womb that their first being bred then give my tongue like leave to love my head how courtesy would seem to cover sin when what is done is like an hypocrite the which is good in nothing but in sight if it be true that i interpret false then were it certain you were not so bad as with foul incest to abuse your soul where now you're both a father and a son by your untimely claspings with your child which pleasures fits a husband not a father and she an eater of her mother's flesh by the defiling of her parents' bed and both like serpents are who though they feed on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men blush not in actions blacker than the night will 'schew no course to keep them from the light one sin i know another doth provoke murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke poison and treason are the hands of sin ay and the targets to put off the shame then lest my life be cropped to keep you clear by flight i'll shun the danger which i fear let none disturb us why should this change of thoughts the sad companion dull eyed melancholy be my so used a guest as not an hour in the day's glorious walk or peaceful night the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them and danger which i feared is at antioch whose arm seems far too short to hit me here yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits nor yet the other's distance comfort me then it is thus the passions of the mind that have their first conception by misdread have after nourishment and life by care and what was first but fear what might be done grows elder now and cares it be not done and so with me the great antiochus 'gainst whom i am too little to contend since he's so great can make his will his act will think me speaking though i swear to silence nor boots it me to say i honor him if he suspect i may dishonor him and what may make him blush in being known he'll stop the course by which it might be known with hostile forces he'll o'er spread the land and with th' ostent of war will look so huge amazement shall drive courage from the state our men be vanquished ere they do resist and subjects punished that ne'er thought offense which care of them not pity of myself who am no more but as the tops of trees which fence the roots they grow by and defend them makes both my body pine and soul to languish and punish that before that he would punish all leave us else but let your cares o'erlook what shipping and what lading's in our haven and then return to us helicanus thou hast moved us what seest thou in our looks if there be such a dart in princes' frowns how durst thy tongue move anger to our face thou knowest i have power to take thy life from thee rise prithee rise sit down thou art no flatterer i thank thee for 't and heaven forbid that kings should let their ears hear their faults hid fit counselor and servant for a prince who by thy wisdom makes a prince thy servant what wouldst thou have me do thou speak'st like a physician helicanus that ministers a potion unto me that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself attend me then i went to antioch where as thou know'st against the face of death i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty from whence an issue i might propagate are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder the rest hark in thine ear as black as incest which by my knowledge found the sinful father seemed not to strike but smooth but thou know'st this 'tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss which fear so grew in me i hither fled under the covering of a careful night who seemed my good protector and being here bethought me what was past what might succeed i knew him tyrannous and tyrants' fears decrease not but grow faster than the years and should he doubt as no doubt he doth that i should open to the list'ning air how many worthy princes' bloods were shed to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope to lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms and make pretense of wrong that i have done him when all for mine if i may call 't offense must feel war's blow who spares not innocence which love to all of which thyself art one who now reproved'st me for 't  drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks musings into my mind with thousand doubts how i might stop this tempest ere it came and finding little comfort to relieve them i thought it princely charity to grieve for them i do not doubt thy faith but should he wrong my liberties in my absence tyre i now look from thee then and to tarsus intend my travel where i'll hear from thee and by whose letters i'll dispose myself the care i had and have of subjects' good on thee i lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it i'll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath who shuns not to break one will crack both but in our orbs we'll live so round and safe that time of both this truth shall ne'er convince thou showed'st a subject's shine i a true prince lord governor for so we hear you are let not our ships and number of our men be like a beacon fired t' amaze your eyes we have heard your miseries as far as tyre and seen the desolation of your streets nor come we to add sorrow to your tears but to relieve them of their heavy load and these our ships you happily may think are like the trojan horse was stuffed within with bloody veins expecting overthrow are stored with corn to make your needy bread and give them life whom hunger starved half dead arise i pray you rise we do not look for reverence but for love and harborage for ourself our ships and men which welcome we'll accept feast here awhile until our stars that frown lend us a smile yet cease your ire you angry stars of heaven wind rain and thunder remember earthly man is but a substance that must yield to you and i as fits my nature do obey you alas the seas hath cast me on the rocks washed me from shore to shore and left my breath nothing to think on but ensuing death let it suffice the greatness of your powers to have bereft a prince of all his fortunes and having thrown him from your wat'ry grave here to have death in peace is all he'll crave a pretty moral simonides how from the finny subject of the sea these fishers tell the infirmities of men and from their wat'ry empire recollect all that may men approve or men detect  peace be at your labor honest fishermen may see the sea hath cast upon your coast  a man whom both the waters and the wind in that vast tennis court hath made the ball for them to play upon entreats you pity him he asks of you that never used to beg i never practiced it what i have been i have forgot to know but what i am want teaches me to think on a man thronged up with cold my veins are chill and have no more of life than may suffice to give my tongue that heat to ask your help  which if you shall refuse when i am dead for that i am a man pray you see me buried i thank you sir i did but crave why are your beggars whipped then how well this honest mirth becomes their labor not well the good simonides do you call him he is a happy king since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government how far is his court distant from this shore were my fortunes equal to my desires i could wish to make one there an armor friends i pray you let me see it thanks fortune yet that after all thy crosses thou givest me somewhat to repair myself and though it was mine own part of my heritage which my dead father did bequeath to me with this strict charge even as he left his life keep it my pericles it hath been a shield 'twixt me and death and pointed to this brace for that it saved me keep it in like necessity  the which the gods protect thee from may 't defend thee it kept where i kept i so dearly loved it till the rough seas that spares not any man took it in rage though calmed have given 't again i thank thee for 't my shipwrack now's no ill since i have here my father gave in his will to beg of you kind friends this coat of worth for it was sometime target to a king i know it by this mark he loved me dearly and for his sake i wish the having of it and that you'd guide me to your sovereign's court where with it i may appear a gentleman and if that ever my low fortune's better i'll pay your bounties till then rest your debtor i'll show the virtue i have borne in arms believe 't i will by your furtherance i am clothed in steel and spite of all the rupture of the sea this jewel holds his biding on my arm unto thy value i will mount myself upon a courser whose delightful steps shall make the gazer joy to see him tread only my friend i yet am unprovided of a pair of bases then honor be but a goal to my will this day i'll rise or else add ill to ill 'tis more by fortune lady than my merit some other is more fit you are right courteous knights yon king's to me like to my father's picture which tells in that glory once he was  had princes sit like stars about his throne and he the sun for them to reverence none that beheld him but like lesser lights did vail their crowns to his supremacy where now his son's like a glowworm in the night the which hath fire in darkness none in light whereby i see that time's the king of men he's both their parent and he is their grave and gives them what he will not what they crave i thank him i thank both him and you and pledge him freely a gentleman of tyre my name pericles my education been in arts and arms who looking for adventures in the world was by the rough seas reft of ships and men and after shipwrack driven upon this shore in those that practice them they are my lord i am at your grace's pleasure all fortune to the good simonides it is your grace's pleasure to commend not my desert the worst of all her scholars my good lord a most virtuous princess as a fair day in summer wondrous fair i am unworthy for her schoolmaster what's here a letter that she loves the knight of tyre 'tis the king's subtlety to have my life  o seek not to entrap me gracious lord a stranger and distress\u00e8d gentleman that never aimed so high to love your daughter but bent all offices to honor her by the gods i have not never did thought of mine levy offense nor never did my actions yet commence a deed might gain her love or your displeasure traitor even in his throat unless it be the king that calls me traitor i return the lie my actions are as noble as my thoughts that never relished of a base descent i came unto your court for honor's cause and not to be a rebel to her state and he that otherwise accounts of me this sword shall prove he's honor's enemy then as you are as virtuous as fair resolve your angry father if my tongue did e'er solicit or my hand subscribe to any syllable that made love to you even as my life my blood that fosters it yes if 't please your majesty the god of this great vast rebuke these surges which wash both heaven and hell and thou that hast upon the winds command bind them in brass having called them from the deep o still thy deaf'ning dreadful thunders gently quench thy nimble sulfurous flashes o how lychorida how does my queen then storm venomously wilt thou spit all thyself the seaman's whistle is as a whisper in the ears of death unheard lychorida lucina o divinest patroness and midwife gentle

womb even at the first thy loss is more than can thy portage quit with all thou canst find here now the good gods throw their best eyes upon 't courage enough i do not fear the flaw it hath done to me the worst yet for the love of this poor infant this fresh new seafarer i would it would be quiet that's your superstition as you think meet most wretched queen a terrible childbed hast thou had my dear no light no fire th' unfriendly elements forgot thee utterly nor have i time to give thee hallowed to thy grave but straight must cast thee scarcely coffined in the ooze where for a monument upon thy bones and e'er remaining lamps the belching whale and humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse lying with simple shells o lychorida bid nestor bring me spices ink and paper my casket and my jewels and bid nicander bring me the satin coffin lay the babe upon the pillow hie thee whiles i say a priestly farewell to her suddenly woman i thank thee mariner say what coast is this thither gentle mariner alter thy course for tyre when canst thou reach it o make for tarsus there will i visit cleon for the babe cannot hold out to tyrus there i'll leave it at careful nursing go thy ways good mariner i'll bring the body presently most honored cleon i must needs be gone my twelve months are expired and tyrus stands in a litigious peace you and your lady take from my heart all thankfulness

sea i have named so here i charge your charity withal leaving her the infant of your care beseeching you to give her princely training that she may be mannered as she is born i believe you your honor and your goodness teach me to 't without your vows till she be married madam by bright diana whom we honor all unscissored shall this hair of mine remain though i show ill in 't so i take my leave

mistress on whose grace you may depend hereafter come my lord hum ha my fortunes parentage good parentage to equal mine was it not thus what say you i do think so pray you turn your eyes upon me you're like something that what countrywoman here of these shores i am great with woe and shall deliver weeping my dearest wife was like this maid and such a one my daughter might have been my queen's square brows her stature to an inch as wandlike straight as silver voiced her eyes as jewel like and cased as richly in pace another juno who starves the ears she feeds and makes them hungry the more

lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony let me not hinder cassius your desires i'll leave you cassius be not deceived if i have veiled my look i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself vex\u00e8d i am of late with passions of some difference conceptions only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors but let not therefore my good friends be grieved among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutus with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men no cassius for the eye sees not itself but by reflection by some other things into what dangers would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me what means this shouting i do fear the people choose caesar for their king i would not cassius yet i love him well but wherefore do you hold me here so long what is it that you would impart to me if it be aught toward the general good set honor in one eye and death i' th' other and i will look on both indifferently for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honor more than i fear death another general shout i do believe that these applauses are for some new honors that are heaped on caesar that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further moved what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things till then my noble friend chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us the games are done and caesar is returning i will do so but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesar's brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calphurnia's cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being crossed in conference by some senators ay casca tell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad i should not then ask casca what had chanced what was the second noise for was the crown offered him thrice tell us the manner of it gentle casca 'tis very like he hath the falling sickness what said he when he came unto himself and after that he came thus sad away what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school and so it is for this time i will leave you tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you what lucius ho  i cannot by the progress of the stars give guess how near to day lucius i say  i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly  when lucius when awake i say what lucius get me a taper in my study lucius when it is lighted come and call me here it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general he would be crowned how that might change his nature there's the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking crown him that and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with th' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections swayed more than his reason but 'tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambition's ladder whereto the climber upward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpent's egg which hatched would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell get you to bed again it is not day is not tomorrow boy the ides of march look in the calendar and bring me word the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself shall rome etc speak strike redress brutus thou sleep'st awake such instigations have been often dropped where i have took them up shall rome etc thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one man's awe what rome my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was called a king speak strike redress am i entreated to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus 'tis good go to the gate somebody knocks since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection is he alone do you know them let 'em enter they are the faction o conspiracy sham'st thou to show thy dang'rous brow by night when evils are most free o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention i have been up this hour awake all night know i these men that come along with you he is welcome hither he is welcome too they are all welcome what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night give me your hands all over one by one no not an oath if not the face of men the sufferance of our souls the time's abuse  if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let high sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery but if these  as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valor the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath passed from him o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow anything that other men begin our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar let's be sacrificers but not butchers caius we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesar's spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide 'em this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be called purgers not murderers and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesar's arm when caesar's head is off alas good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wildness and much company peace count the clock by the eighth hour is that the uttermost now good metellus go along by him he loves me well and i have given him reasons send him but hither and i'll fashion him good gentlemen look fresh and merrily let not our looks put on our purposes but bear it as our roman actors do with untired spirits and formal constancy and so good morrow to you every one boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber thou hast no figures nor no fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men therefore thou sleep'st so sound portia what mean you wherefore rise you now it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning i am not well in health and that is all why so i do good portia go to bed kneel not gentle portia you are my true and honorable wife as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart o you gods render me worthy of this noble wife hark hark one knocks portia go in awhile and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart all my engagements i will construe to thee all the charactery of my sad brows leave me with haste lucius who 's that knocks caius ligarius that metellus spoke of  boy stand aside caius ligarius how o what a time have you chose out brave caius to wear a kerchief would you were not sick such an exploit have i in hand ligarius had you a healthful ear to hear of it a piece of work that will make sick men whole that must we also what it is my caius i shall unfold to thee as we are going to whom it must be done follow me then caesar 'tis strucken eight that every like is not the same o caesar the heart of brutus earns to think upon what said popilius lena look how he makes to caesar mark him cassius be constant popilius lena speaks not of our purposes for look he smiles and caesar doth not change he is addressed press near and second him i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal people and senators be not affrighted fly not stand still ambition's debt is paid where's publius talk not of standing publius good cheer there is no harm intended to your person nor to no roman else so tell them publius do so and let no man abide this deed but we the doers fates we will know your pleasures that we shall die we know 'tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon grant that and then is death a benefit so are we caesar's friends that have abridged his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop and let us bathe our hands in caesar's blood up to the elbows and besmear our swords then walk we forth even to the marketplace and waving our red weapons o'er our heads let's all cry peace freedom and liberty how many times shall caesar bleed in sport that now on pompey's basis lies along no worthier than the dust soft who comes here a friend of antony's thy master is a wise and valiant roman i never thought him worse tell him so please him come unto this place he shall be satisfied and by my honor depart untouched i know that we shall have him well to friend but here comes antony welcome mark antony o antony beg not your death of us though now we must appear bloody and cruel as by our hands and this our present act you see we do yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done our hearts you see not they are pitiful and pity to the general wrong of rome as fire drives out fire so pity pity hath done this deed on caesar for your part to you our swords have leaden points mark antony our arms in strength of malice and our hearts of brothers' temper do receive you in with all kind love good thoughts and reverence only be patient till we have appeased the multitude beside themselves with fear and then we will deliver you the cause why i that did love caesar when i struck him have thus proceeded or else were this a savage spectacle our reasons are so full of good regard that were you antony the son of caesar you should be satisfied you shall mark antony by your pardon i will myself into the pulpit first and show the reason of our caesar's death what antony shall speak i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies it shall advantage more than do us wrong mark antony here take you caesar's body you shall not in your funeral speech blame us but speak all good you can devise of caesar and say you do 't by our permission else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going after my speech is ended prepare the body then and follow us then follow me and give me audience friends  cassius go you into the other street and part the numbers  those that will hear me speak let 'em stay here those that will follow cassius go with him and public reasons shall be render\u00e8d of caesar's death be patient till the last romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear believe me for mine honor and have respect to mine honor that you may believe censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of caesar's to him i say that brutus' love to caesar was no less than his if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer not that i loved caesar less but that i loved rome more had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live all freemen as caesar loved me i weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was valiant i honor him but as he was ambitious i slew him there is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor and death for his ambition who is here so base that would be a bondman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so rude that would not be a roman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so vile that will not love his country if any speak for him have i offended i pause for a reply then none have i offended i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death here comes his body mourned by mark antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not with this i depart that as i slew my best lover for the good of rome i have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death my countrymen  good countrymen let me depart alone and for my sake stay here with antony do grace to caesar's corpse and grace his speech tending to caesar's glories which mark antony by our permission is allowed to make i do entreat you not a man depart save i alone till antony have spoke stand ho what now lucilius is cassius near he greets me well your master pindarus in his own change or by ill officers hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done undone but if he be at hand i shall be satisfied he is not doubted a word lucilius how he received you let me be resolved thou hast described a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius when love begins to sicken and decay it useth an enforc\u00e8d ceremony there are no tricks in plain and simple faith but hollow men like horses hot at hand make gallant show and promise of their mettle but when they should endure the bloody spur they fall their crests and like deceitful jades sink in the trial comes his army on hark he is arrived march gently on to meet him stand ho speak the word along judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies and if not so how should i wrong a brother cassius be content speak your griefs softly i do know you well before the eyes of both our armies here which should perceive nothing but love from us let us not wrangle bid them move away then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs and i will give you audience lucius do you the like and let no man come to our tent till we have done our conference let lucilius and titinius guard our door you wronged yourself to write in such a case let me tell you cassius you yourself are much condemned to have an itching palm to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers the name of cassius honors this corruption and chastisement doth therefore hide his head remember march the ides of march remember did not great julius bleed for justice' sake what villain touched his body that did stab and not for justice what shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes and sell the mighty space of our large honors for so much trash as may be grasp\u00e8d thus i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a roman go to you are not cassius i say you are not

is no terror cassius in your threats for i am armed so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind which i respect not i did send to you for certain sums of gold which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means by heaven i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection i did send to you for gold to pay my legions which you denied me was that done like cassius should i have answered caius cassius so when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends be ready gods with all your thunderbolts dash him to pieces you did i do not till you practice them on me i do not like your faults a flatterer's would not though they do appear as huge as high olympus sheathe your dagger be angry when you will it shall have scope do what you will dishonor shall be humor o cassius you are yok\u00e8d with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire who much enforc\u00e8d shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again when i spoke that i was ill tempered too and my heart too what's the matter yes cassius and from henceforth when you are over earnest with your brutus he'll think your mother chides and leave you so get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence i'll know his humor when he knows his time what should the wars do with these jigging fools  companion hence lucilius and titinius bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight lucius a bowl of wine o cassius i am sick of many griefs no man bears sorrow better portia is dead she

noblest of thy strain young man thou couldst not die more honorable ho lucilius hark a word with you even so lucilius even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below no cassius no think not thou noble roman that ever brutus will go bound to rome he bears too great a mind but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun and whether

majesty's good thoughts away from me i will redeem all this on percy's head and in the closing of some glorious day be bold to tell you that i am your son when i will wear a garment all of blood and stain my favors in a bloody mask which washed away shall scour my shame with it and that shall be the day whene'er it lights that this same child of honor and renown this gallant hotspur this all prais\u00e8d knight and your unthought of harry chance to meet for every honor sitting on his helm would they were multitudes and on my head my shames redoubled for the time will come that i shall make this northern youth exchange his glorious deeds for my indignities percy is but my factor good my lord to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf and i will call him to so strict account that he shall render every glory up yea even the slightest worship of his time or i will tear the reckoning from his heart this in the name of god i promise here the which if he be pleased i shall perform i do beseech your majesty may salve the long grown wounds of my intemperance if not the end of life cancels all bands and i will die a hundred thousand deaths ere break the smallest parcel of this vow

it should how would thy guts fall about thy knees but sirrah there's no room for faith truth nor honesty in this bosom of thine it is all filled up with guts and midriff charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket why thou whoreson impudent embossed rascal if there were anything in thy pocket but tavern reckonings memorandums of bawdy houses and one poor pennyworth of sugar candy to make thee long winded if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these i am a villain and yet you will stand to it you will not pocket up wrong art thou not ashamed it appears so by the story o my

lie how now blown jack how now quilt i think to steal cream indeed for thy theft hath already made thee butter but tell me jack whose fellows are these that come after i did never see such pitiful rascals no i'll be sworn unless you call three fingers in the ribs bare but sirrah make haste percy is already in the field the southern wind doth play the trumpet to his purposes and by his hollow whistling in the leaves foretells a tempest and a blust'ring day peace chewet peace in both your armies there is many a soul shall pay full dearly for this encounter if once they join in trial tell your nephew the prince of wales doth join with all the world in praise of henry percy by my hopes this present enterprise set off his head i do not think a braver gentleman more active valiant or more valiant young more daring or more bold is now alive to grace this latter age with noble deeds for my part i may speak it to my shame i have a truant been to chivalry and so i hear he doth account me too yet this before my father's majesty i am content that he shall take the odds of his great name and estimation and will to save the blood on either side try fortune with him in a single fight it will not be accepted on my life the douglas and the hotspur both together are confident against the world in arms nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship say thy prayers and farewell why thou owest god a death what stand'st thou idle here lend me thy sword many a nobleman lies stark and stiff under the hoofs of vaunting enemies whose deaths are yet unrevenged i prithee lend me thy sword he is indeed and living to kill thee i prithee lend me thy sword give it me what is it in the case what is it a time to jest and dally now i beseech your majesty make up lest your retirement do amaze your friends lead me my lord i do not need your help and god forbid a shallow scratch should drive the prince of wales from such a field as this where stained nobility lies trodden on and rebels' arms triumph in massacres by god thou hast deceived me lancaster i did not think thee lord of such a spirit before i loved thee as a brother john but now i do respect thee as my soul o this boy lends mettle to us all hold up thy head vile scot or thou art like never to hold it up again the spirits of valiant shirley stafford blunt are in my arms it is the prince of wales that threatens thee who never promiseth but he means to pay cheerly my lord how fares your grace sir nicholas gawsey hath for succor sent and so hath clifton i'll to clifton straight o god they did me too much injury that ever said i hearkened for your death if it were so i might have let alone the insulting hand of douglas over you which would have been as speedy in your end as all the poisonous potions in the world and saved the treacherous labor of your son thou speak'st as if i would deny my name why then i see a very valiant rebel of the name i am the prince of wales and think not percy to share with me in glory any more two stars keep not their motion in one sphere nor can one england brook a double reign of harry percy and the prince of wales i'll make it greater ere i part from thee and all the budding honors on thy crest i'll crop to make a garland for my head for worms brave percy fare thee well great heart ill weaved ambition how much art thou shrunk when that this body did contain a spirit a kingdom for it was too small a bound but now two paces of the vilest earth is room enough this earth that bears thee dead bears not alive so stout a gentleman if thou wert sensible of courtesy i should not make so dear a show of zeal but let my favors hide thy mangled face and even in thy behalf i'll thank myself for doing these fair rites of tenderness adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave but not remembered in thy epitaph what old acquaintance could not all this flesh keep in a little life poor jack farewell i could have better spared a better man o i should have a heavy miss of thee if i were much in love with vanity death hath not struck so fat a deer today though many dearer in this bloody fray emboweled will i see thee by and by till then in blood by noble percy lie come brother john full bravely hast thou fleshed thy maiden sword i did i saw him dead breathless and bleeding on the ground art thou alive or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight i prithee speak we will not trust our eyes without our ears thou art not what thou seem'st why percy i killed myself and saw thee dead this is the strangest fellow brother john  come bring your luggage nobly on your back for my part if a lie may do thee grace i'll gild it with the happiest terms i have the trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours come brother let us to the highest of the field to see what friends are living who are dead the noble scot lord douglas when he saw the fortune of the day quite turned from him the noble percy slain and all his men upon the foot of fear fled with the rest and falling from a hill he was so bruised that the pursuers took him at my tent the douglas is and i beseech your grace i may dispose of him then brother john of lancaster to you this honorable bounty shall belong go to the douglas and deliver him up to his pleasure ransomless and free his valors shown upon our crests today have taught us how to cherish such high deeds even in the bosom of our adversaries", "H5_Fluellen": "up to the breach you dogs avaunt you cullions to the mines tell you the duke it is not so good to come to the mines

does require her times of preservation which perforce i her frail son amongst my brethren mortal must give my tendance to and ever may your highness yoke together as i will lend you cause my doing well with my well saying what should this mean my sovereign i confess your royal graces showered on me daily have been more than could my studied purposes requite which went beyond all man's endeavors my endeavors have ever come too short of my desires yet filed with my abilities mine own ends have been mine so that evermore they pointed to th' good of your most sacred person and the profit of the state for your great graces heaped upon me poor undeserver i can nothing render but allegiant thanks my prayers to heaven for you my loyalty which ever has and ever shall be growing till death that winter kill it i do profess that for your highness' good i ever labored more than mine own that am have and will be  though all the world should crack their duty to you and throw it from their soul though perils did abound as thick as thought could make 'em and appear in forms more horrid yet my duty as doth a rock against the chiding flood should the approach of this wild river break and stand

mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom and fee my friends in rome o negligence fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil made me put this main secret in the packet i sent the king is there no way to cure this no new device to beat this from his brains i know 'twill stir him strongly yet i know a way if it take right in spite of fortune will bring me off again what's this to th' pope the letter as i live with all the business i writ to 's holiness nay then farewell i have touched the highest point of all my greatness and from that full meridian of my glory i haste now to my setting i shall fall like a bright exhalation in the evening and no man see me more stay where's your commission lords words cannot carry authority so weighty till i find more than will or words to do it  i mean your malice know officious lords i dare and must deny it now i feel of what coarse metal you are molded envy how eagerly you follow my disgraces as if it fed you and how sleek and wanton you appear in everything may bring my ruin follow your envious courses men of malice you have christian warrant for 'em and no doubt in time will find their fit rewards that seal you ask with such a violence the king mine and your master with his own hand gave me bade me enjoy it with the place and honors during my life and to confirm his goodness tied it by letters patents now who'll take it it must be himself then proud lord thou liest within these forty hours surrey durst better have burnt that tongue than said so this and all else this talking lord can lay upon my credit i answer is most false the duke by law found his deserts how innocent i was from any private malice in his end his noble jury and foul cause can witness  if i loved many words lord i should tell you you have as little honesty as honor that in the way of loyalty and truth toward the king my ever royal master dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be and all that love his follies all goodness is poison to thy stomach how much methinks i could despise this man but that i am bound in charity against it so much fairer and spotless shall mine innocence arise when the king knows my truth speak on sir i dare your worst objections if i blush it is to see a nobleman want manners so farewell to the little good you bear me farewell a long farewell to all my greatness this is the state of man today he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honors thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is a ripening nips his root and then he falls as i do i have ventured like little wanton boys that swim on bladders this many summers in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth my high blown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must forever hide me vain pomp and glory of this world i hate you i feel my heart new opened o how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin more pangs and fears than wars or women have and when he falls he falls like lucifer never to hope again why how now cromwell what amazed at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline nay an you weep i am fall'n indeed why well never so truly happy my good cromwell i know myself now and i feel within me a peace above all earthly dignities a still and quiet conscience the king has cured me  i humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders these ruined pillars out of pity taken a load would sink a navy too much honor o 'tis a burden cromwell 'tis a burden too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven i hope i have i am able now methinks out of a fortitude of soul i feel to endure more miseries and greater far than my weak hearted enemies dare offer what news abroad god bless him that's somewhat sudden but he's a learn\u00e8d man may he continue long in his highness' favor and do justice for truth's sake and his conscience that his bones when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings may have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on him what more that's news indeed there was the weight that pulled me down o cromwell the king has gone beyond me all my glories in that one woman i have lost forever no sun shall ever usher forth mine honors or gild again the noble troops that waited upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell i am a poor fall'n man unworthy now to be thy lord and master seek the king that sun i pray may never set i have told him what and how true thou art he will advance thee some little memory of me will stir him  i know his noble nature not to let thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell neglect him not make use now and provide for thine own future safety cromwell i did not think to shed a tear in all my miseries but thou hast forced me out of thy honest truth to play the woman let's dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell and when i am forgotten as i shall be and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention of me more must be heard of say i taught thee say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory and sounded all the depths and shoals of honor found thee a way out of his wrack to rise in a sure and safe one though thy master missed it mark but my fall and that that ruined me cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition by that sin fell the angels how can man then the image of his maker hope to win by it love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee corruption wins not more than honesty still in thy right hand carry gentle peace to silence envious tongues be just and fear not let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's thy god's and truth's then if thou fall'st o cromwell thou fall'st a bless\u00e8d martyr serve the king and prithee lead me in there take an inventory of all i have to the last penny 'tis the king's my robe and my integrity to heaven is all i dare now call mine own o cromwell cromwell had i but served my god with half the zeal i served my king he would not in mine age have left me naked to mine enemies so i have farewell the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell", "Cor_Menenius": "what work 's my countrymen in hand where go you with bats and clubs the matter speak i pray you why masters my good

care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious or be accused of folly i shall tell you a pretty tale it may be you have heard it but since it serves my purpose i will venture to stale 't a little more there was a time when all the body's members rebelled against the belly thus accused it that only like a gulf it did remain i' th' midst o' th' body idle and unactive still cupboarding the viand never bearing like labor with the rest where th' other instruments did see and hear devise instruct walk feel and mutually participate did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body the belly answered  sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus  for look you i may make the belly smile as well as speak it tauntingly replied to th' discontented members the mutinous parts that envied his receipt even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you what then 'fore me this fellow speaks what then what then well what then i will tell you if you'll bestow a small of what you have little  patience awhile you'st hear the belly's answer note me this good friend your most grave belly was deliberate not rash like his accusers and thus answered true is it my incorporate friends quoth he that i receive the general food at first which you do live upon and fit it is because i am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body but if you do remember i send it through the rivers of your blood even to the court the heart to th' seat o' th'

at the point of battle the one side must have bale hail noble martius for corn at their own rates whereof they say the city is well stored nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you what says the other troop what is granted them this is strange o true bred the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight not according to the prayer of the people for they love not martius pray you who does the wolf love ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble martius he's a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you in what enormity is martius poor in that you two have not in abundance this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city i mean of us o' th' right hand file do you because you talk of pride now will you not be angry why 'tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so you blame martius for being proud i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves o that you could why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber in 't said to be something imperfect in favoring the first complaint hasty and tinder like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as you are i cannot call you lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it i cannot say your worships have delivered the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too what harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too you know neither me yourselves nor anything you are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a faucet seller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves you are a pair of strange ones our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honorable a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entombed in an ass's packsaddle yet you must be saying martius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary hangmen good e'en to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you how now my as fair as noble ladies and the moon were she earthly no nobler whither do you follow your eyes so fast ha martius coming home take my cap jupiter and i thank thee hoo martius coming home i will make my very house reel tonight a letter for me a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven years' health in which time i will make a lip at the physician the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horse drench is he not wounded he was wont to come home wounded so do i too if it be not too much brings he victory in his pocket the wounds become him has he disciplined aufidius soundly and 'twas time for him too i'll warrant him that an he had

purchasing true i'll be sworn they are true where is he wounded god save your good worships martius is coming home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded one i' th' neck and two i' th'

could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome a curse begin at very root on 's heart that is not glad to see thee you are three that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men we have some old crab trees here at home that will not be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our after meeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our well found successes to report a little of that worthy work performed by martius caius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honors like himself that's off that's off i would you rather had been silent please you to hear cominius speak he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow  worthy cominius speak nay keep your place pray now sit down masters of the people your multiplying spawn how can he flatter  that's thousand to one good one when you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honor than one on 's ears to hear it proceed cominius worthy man he's right noble let him be called for the senate coriolanus are well pleased to make thee consul it then remains that you do speak to the people put them not to 't pray you go fit you to the custom and take to you as your predecessors have your honor with your form do not stand upon 't  we recommend to you tribunes of the people our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honor o sir you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have done 't o me the gods you must not speak of that you must desire them to think upon you you'll mar all i'll leave you pray you speak to 'em i pray you in wholesome manner you have stood your limitation and the tribunes endue you with the people's voice remains that in th' official marks invested you anon do meet the senate i'll keep you company will you along the matter be calm be calm let's be calm not now not now well no more what what his choler well well no more of that come enough on both sides more respect peace peace peace stay hold peace what is about to be i am out of breath confusion's near i cannot speak you tribunes to th' people coriolanus patience  speak good sicinius fie fie fie this is the way to kindle not to quench and so are like to do hear me one word beseech you tribunes hear me but a word be that you seem truly your country's friend and temp'rately proceed to what you would thus violently redress down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile help martius help you that be noble help him young and old go get you to your house begone away all will be naught else shall it be put to that for 'tis a sore upon us you cannot tent yourself begone beseech you begone put not your worthy rage into your tongue one time will owe another i could myself take up a brace o' th' best of them yea the two tribunes pray you begone i'll try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little this must be patched with cloth of any color his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove for 's power to thunder his heart's his mouth what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry does forget that ever he heard the name of death here's goodly work i would they were in tiber what the vengeance could he not speak 'em fair you worthy tribunes  sir sir  do not cry havoc where you should but hunt with modest warrant hear me speak as i do know the consul's worthiness so can i name his faults the consul coriolanus if by the tribunes' leave and yours good people i may be heard i would crave a word or two the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time now the good gods forbid that our renown\u00e8d rome whose gratitude towards her deserv\u00e8d children is enrolled in jove's own book like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own o he's a limb that has but a disease  mortal to cut it off to cure it easy what has he done to rome that's worthy death killing our enemies the blood he hath lost  which i dare vouch is more than that he hath by many an ounce he dropped it for his country and what is left to lose it by his country were to us all that do 't and suffer it a brand to th' end o' th' world one word more one word this tiger footed rage when it shall find the harm of unscanned swiftness will too late tie leaden pounds to 's heels proceed by process lest parties as he is beloved break out and sack great rome with romans consider this he has been bred i' th' wars since he could draw a sword and is ill schooled in bolted language meal and bran together he throws without distinction give me leave i'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril i'll bring him to you let me desire your company he must come or what is worst will follow come come you have been too rough something too rough you must return and mend it well said noble woman before he should thus stoop to th' herd but that the violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic for the whole state i would put mine armor on which i can scarcely bear return to th' tribunes repent what you have spoke a good demand noble lady  come go with us speak fair you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the loss of what is past this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being asked as free as words to little purpose only fair speech ay but mildly calmly i do beseech you a noble wish lo citizens he says he is content the warlike service he has done consider think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves i' th' holy churchyard consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you nay temperately your promise is this the promise that you made your mother that's worthily as any ear can hear come let's not weep if i could shake off but one seven years from these old arms and legs by the good gods i'd with thee every foot peace peace be not so loud come come peace you have told them home and by my troth you have cause you'll sup with me fie fie fie hail to you both all's well and might have been much better if he could have temporized nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife hear nothing from him i think not so 'tis aufidius who hearing of our martius' banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world which were inshelled when martius stood for rome and durst not once peep out cannot be we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like hath been within my age but reason with the fellow before you punish him where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atone than violent'st contrariety what news what news what's the news what's the news pray now your news  you have made fair work i fear me pray your news if martius should be joined with volscians  you have made good work you and your apron men you that stood so much upon the voice of occupation and the breath of garlic eaters as hercules did shake down mellow fruit you have made fair work we are all undone unless the noble man have mercy 'tis true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it i have not the face to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands you and your crafts you have crafted fair how was 't we we loved him but like beasts and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o' th' city here come the clusters  and is aufidius with him you are they that made the air unwholesome when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus' exile now he's coming and not a hair upon a soldier's head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down and pay you for your voices 'tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal we have deserved it you have made good work you and your cry  shall 's to the capitol no i'll not go you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general who loved him in a most dear particular he called me father but what o' that go you that banished him a mile before his tent fall down and knee the way into his mercy nay if he coyed to hear cominius speak i'll keep at home do you hear why so you have made good work a pair of tribunes that have wracked rome to make coals cheap a noble memory very well could he say less for one poor grain or two i am one of those his mother wife his child and this brave fellow too we are the grains you are the musty chaff and you are smelt above the moon we must be burnt for you no i'll not meddle what should i do well and say that martius return me as cominius is returned unheard what then but as a discontented friend grief shot with his unkindness say 't be so i'll undertake 't i think he'll hear me yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me he was not taken well he had not dined the veins unfilled our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuffed these pipes and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priestlike fasts therefore i'll watch him till he be dieted to my request and then i'll set upon him good faith i'll prove him speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge of my success you guard like men 'tis well but by your leave i am an officer of state and come to speak with coriolanus from rome good my friends if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name hath touched your ears it is menenius i tell thee fellow thy general is my lover i have been the book of his good acts whence men have read his fame unparalleled happily amplified for i have ever verified my friends  of whom he's chief with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes like to a bowl upon a subtle ground i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise have almost stamped the leasing therefore fellow i must have leave to pass prithee fellow remember my name is menenius always factionary on the party of your general has he dined can'st thou tell for i would not speak with him till after dinner i am as thy general is sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me with estimation i mean thy general nay but fellow fellow  now you companion i'll say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from my son coriolanus guess but by my entertainment with him if thou stand'st not i' th' state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueler in suffering behold now presently and swoon for what's to come upon thee the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does o my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee here's water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this who like a block hath denied my access to thee how away i neither care for th' world nor your general for such things as you i can scarce think there's any you're so slight he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst for you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age i say to you as i was said to away see you yond coign o' th' capitol yond cornerstone if it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of rome especially his mother may prevail with him but i say there is no hope in 't our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution there is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub this martius is grown from man to dragon he has wings he's more than a creeping thing so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight year old horse the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery he sits in his state as a thing made for alexander what he bids be done is finished with his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in i paint him in the character mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find and all this is long of you no in such a case the gods will not be good unto us when we banished him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us this is good news i will go meet the ladies this volumnia is worth of consuls senators patricians a city full of tribunes such as you a sea and land full you have prayed well today this morning for ten thousand of your throats i'd not have given a doit hark how they joy", "1H4_Hotspur": "my liege i did deny no prisoners but i remember when the fight was done when i was dry with rage and extreme toil breathless and faint leaning upon my sword came there a certain lord neat and trimly dressed fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reaped showed like a stubble land at harvest home he was perfum\u00e8d like a milliner and 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held a pouncet box which ever and anon he gave his nose and took 't away again who therewith angry when it next came there took it in snuff and still he smiled and talked and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by he called them untaught knaves unmannerly to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility with many holiday and lady terms he questioned me amongst the rest demanded my prisoners in your majesty's behalf i then all smarting with my wounds being cold to be so pestered with a popinjay out of my grief and my impatience answered neglectingly i know not what  he should or he should not for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a waiting gentlewoman of guns and drums and wounds god save the mark  and telling me the sovereignest thing on earth was parmacety for an inward bruise and that it was great pity so it was this villainous saltpeter should be digged out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroyed so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier this bald unjointed chat of his my lord i answered indirectly as i said and i beseech you let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty revolted mortimer he never did fall off my sovereign liege but by the chance of war to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds those mouth\u00e8d wounds which valiantly he took when on the gentle severn's sedgy bank in single opposition hand to hand he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severn's flood who then affrighted with their bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank blood stain\u00e8d with these valiant combatants never did bare and rotten policy color her working with such deadly wounds nor never could the noble mortimer receive so many and all willingly then let not him be slandered with revolt an if the devil come and roar for them i will not send them i will after straight and tell him so for i will ease my heart albeit i make a hazard of my head speak of mortimer zounds i will speak of him and let my soul want mercy if i do not join with him yea on his part i'll empty all these veins and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust but i will lift the downtrod mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king as this ingrate and cankered bolingbroke he will forsooth have all my prisoners and when i urged the ransom once again of my wife's brother then his cheek looked pale and on my face he turned an eye of death trembling even at the name of mortimer but soft i pray you did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown nay then i cannot blame his cousin king that wished him on the barren mountains starve but shall it be that you that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornation shall it be that you a world of curses undergo being the agents or base second means the cords the ladder or the hangman rather o pardon me that i descend so low to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtle king shall it for shame be spoken in these days or fill up chronicles in time to come that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf as both of you god pardon it have done to put down richard that sweet lovely rose and plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke and shall it in more shame be further spoken that you are fooled discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames you underwent no yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banished honors and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again revenge the jeering and disdained contempt of this proud king who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore i say  if he fall in good night or sink or swim send danger from the east unto the west so honor cross it from the north to south and let them grapple o the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honor from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line could never touch the ground and pluck up drown\u00e8d honor by the locks so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival all her dignities but out upon this half faced fellowship i cry you mercy i'll keep them all by god he shall not have a scot of them no if a scot would save his soul he shall not i'll keep them by this hand nay i will that's flat he said he would not ransom mortimer forbade my tongue to speak of mortimer but i will find him when he lies asleep and in his ear i'll hollo mortimer nay i'll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but mortimer and give it him to keep his anger still in motion all studies here i solemnly defy save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same sword and buckler prince of wales  but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance  i would have him poisoned with a pot of ale why look you i am whipped and scourged with rods nettled and stung with pismires when i hear of this vile politician bolingbroke in richard's time what do you call the place a plague upon it it is in gloucestershire 'twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept his uncle york where i first bowed my knee unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke 'sblood when you and he came back from ravenspurgh you say true why what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me look when his infant fortune came to age and gentle harry percy and kind cousin o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me good uncle tell your tale i have done i have done i' faith of york is it not i smell it upon my life it will do well why it cannot choose but be a noble plot and then the power of scotland and of york to join with mortimer ha in faith it is exceedingly well aimed he does he does we'll be revenged on him uncle adieu o let the hours be short till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport but for mine own part my lord i could be well contented to be there in respect of the love i bear your house he could be contented why is he not then in respect of the love he bears our house he shows in this he loves his own barn better than he loves our house let me see some more the purpose you undertake is dangerous why that's certain 'tis dangerous to take a cold to sleep to drink but i tell you my lord fool out of this nettle danger we pluck this flower safety the purpose you undertake is dangerous the friends you have named uncertain the time itself unsorted and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition say you so say you so i say unto you again you are a shallow cowardly hind and you lie what a lack brain is this by the lord our plot is a good plot as ever was laid our friends true and constant a good plot good friends and full of expectation an excellent plot very good friends what a frosty spirited rogue is this why my lord of york commends the plot and the general course of the action zounds an i were now by this rascal i could brain him with his lady's fan is there not my father my uncle and myself lord edmund mortimer my lord of york and owen glendower is there not besides the douglas have i not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month and are they not some of them set forward already what a pagan rascal is this an infidel ha you shall see now in very sincerity of fear and cold heart will he to the king and lay open all our proceedings o i could divide myself and go to buffets for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honorable an action hang him let him tell the king we are prepared i will set forward tonight how now kate i must leave you within these two hours what ho is gilliams with the packet gone hath butler brought those horses from the sheriff what horse a roan a crop ear is it not that roan shall be my throne well i will back him straight o esperance bid butler lead him forth into the park what say'st thou my lady why my horse my love my horse so far afoot i

pass them current too gods me my horse  what say'st thou kate what wouldst thou have with me come wilt thou see me ride and when i am a horseback i will swear i love thee infinitely but hark you kate i must not have you henceforth question me whither i go nor reason whereabout whither i must i must and to conclude this evening must i leave you gentle kate i know you wise but yet no farther wise than harry percy's wife constant you are but yet a woman and for secrecy no lady closer for i well believe thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know and so far will i trust thee gentle kate not an inch further but hark you kate whither i go thither shall you go too today will i set forth tomorrow you will this content you kate lord mortimer and cousin glendower will you sit down and uncle worcester  a plague upon it i have forgot the map and you in hell as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of why so it would have done at the same season if your mother's cat had but kittened though yourself had never been born and i say the earth was not of my mind if you suppose as fearing you it shook o then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire and not in fear of your nativity diseas\u00e8d nature oftentimes breaks forth in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth is with a kind of colic pinched and vexed by the imprisoning of unruly wind within her womb which for enlargement striving shakes the old beldam earth and topples down steeples and moss grown towers at your birth our grandam earth having this distemp'rature in passion shook i think there's no man speaks better welsh i'll to dinner why so can i or so can any man but will they come when you do call for them and i can teach thee coz to shame the devil by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil if thou have power to raise him bring him hither and i'll be sworn i have power to shame him hence o while you live tell truth and shame the devil home without boots and in foul weather too how 'scapes he agues in the devil's name methinks my moiety north from burton here in quantity equals not one of yours see how this river comes me cranking in and cuts me from the best of all my land a huge half moon a monstrous cantle out i'll have the current in this place dammed up and here the smug and silver trent shall run in a new channel fair and evenly it shall not wind with such a deep indent to rob me of so rich a bottom here i'll have it so a little charge will do it will not you who shall say me nay let me not understand you then speak it in welsh marry and i am glad of it with all my heart i had rather be a kitten and cry mew than one of these same meter balladmongers i had rather hear a brazen can'stick turned or a dry wheel grate on the axletree and that would set my teeth nothing an edge nothing so much as mincing poetry 'tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag i do not care i'll give thrice so much land to any well deserving friend but in the way of bargain mark you me i'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair are the indentures drawn shall we be gone i cannot choose sometime he angers me with telling me of the moldwarp and the ant of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies and of a dragon and a finless fish a clip winged griffin and a moulten raven a couching lion and a ramping cat and such a deal of skimble skamble stuff as puts me from my faith i tell you what  he held me last night at least nine hours in reckoning up the several devils' names that were his lackeys i cried hum and well go to but marked him not a word o he is as tedious as a tired horse a railing wife worse than a smoky house i had rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill far than feed on cates and have him talk to me in any summer house in christendom well i am schooled good manners be your speed here come our wives and let us take our leave come kate thou art perfect in lying down come quick quick that i may lay my head in thy lap now i perceive the devil understands welsh and 'tis no marvel he is so humorous by 'r lady he is a good musician i had rather hear lady my brach howl in irish no neither 'tis a woman's fault to the welsh lady's bed peace she sings come kate i'll have your song too not yours in good sooth heart you swear like a comfit maker's wife not you in good sooth and as true as i live and as god shall mend me and as sure as day  and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths as if thou never walk'st further than finsbury swear me kate like a lady as thou art a good mouth filling oath and leave in sooth and such protest of pepper gingerbread to velvet guards and sunday citizens come sing 'tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast teacher an the indentures be drawn i'll away within these two hours and so come in when you will well said my noble scot if speaking truth in this fine age were not thought flattery such attribution should the douglas have as not a soldier of this season's stamp should go so general current through the world by god i cannot flatter i do defy the tongues of soothers but a braver place in my heart's love hath no man than yourself nay task me to my word approve me lord do so and 'tis well what letters hast thou there i can but thank you letters from him why comes he not himself zounds how has he the leisure to be sick in such a justling time who leads his power under whose government come they along sick now droop now this sickness doth infect the very lifeblood of our enterprise 'tis catching hither even to our camp he writes me here that inward sickness  and that his friends by deputation could not so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet to lay so dangerous and dear a trust on any soul removed but on his own yet doth he give us bold advertisement that with our small conjunction we should on to see how fortune is disposed to us for as he writes there is no quailing now because the king is certainly possessed of all our purposes what say you to it a perilous gash a very limb lopped off and yet in faith it is not his present want seems more than we shall find it were it good to set the exact wealth of all our states all at one cast to set so rich a main on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour it were not good for therein should we read the very bottom and the soul of hope the very list the very utmost bound of all our fortunes a rendezvous a home to fly unto if that the devil and mischance look big upon the maidenhead of our affairs you strain too far i rather of his absence make this use it lends a luster and more great opinion a larger dare to our great enterprise than if the earl were here for men must think if we without his help can make a head to push against a kingdom with his help we shall o'erturn it topsy turvy down yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole my cousin vernon welcome by my soul no harm what more he shall be welcome too where is his son the nimble footed madcap prince of wales and his comrades that daffed the world aside and bid it pass no more no more worse than the sun in march this praise doth nourish agues let them come they come like sacrifices in their trim and to the fire eyed maid of smoky war all hot and bleeding will we offer them the mail\u00e8d mars shall on his altar sit up to the ears in blood i am on fire to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh and yet not ours come let me taste my horse who is to bear me like a thunderbolt against the bosom of the prince of wales harry to harry shall hot horse to horse meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse o that glendower were come what may the king's whole battle reach unto forty let it be my father and glendower being both away the powers of us may serve so great a day come let us take a muster speedily doomsday is near die all die merrily we'll fight with him tonight why say you so looks he not for supply his is certain ours is doubtful tonight say i so are the horses of the enemy in general journey bated and brought low the better part of ours are full of rest welcome sir walter blunt and would to god you were of our determination some of us love you well and even those some envy your great deservings and good name because you are not of our quality but stand against us like an enemy the king is kind and well we know the king knows at what time to promise when to pay my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears and when he was not six and twenty strong sick in the world's regard wretched and low a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home my father gave him welcome to the shore and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster to sue his livery and beg his peace with tears of innocency and terms of zeal my father in kind heart and pity moved swore him assistance and performed it too now when the lords and barons of the realm perceived northumberland did lean to him the more and less came in with cap and knee met him in boroughs cities villages attended him on bridges stood in lanes laid gifts before him proffered him their oaths gave him their heirs as pages followed him even at the heels in golden multitudes he presently as greatness knows itself steps me a little higher than his vow made to my father while his blood was poor upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh and now forsooth takes on him to reform some certain edicts and some strait decrees that lie too heavy on the commonwealth cries out upon abuses seems to weep over his country's wrongs and by this face this seeming brow of justice did he win the hearts of all that he did angle for proceeded further cut me off the heads of all the favorites that the absent king in deputation left behind him here when he was personal in the irish war then to the point in short time after he deposed the king soon after that deprived him of his life and in the neck of that tasked the whole state to make that worse suffered his kinsman march who is if every owner were well placed indeed his king to be engaged in wales there without ransom to lie forfeited disgraced me in my happy victories sought to entrap me by intelligence rated mine uncle from the council board in rage dismissed my father from the court broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong and in conclusion drove us to seek out this head of safety and withal to pry into his title the which we find too indirect for long continuance not so sir walter we'll withdraw awhile go to the king and let there be impawned some surety for a safe return again and in the morning early shall mine uncle bring him our purposes and so farewell and maybe so we shall my uncle is returned deliver up my lord of westmoreland  uncle what news lord douglas go you and tell him so did you beg any god forbid o would the quarrel lay upon our heads and that no man might draw short breath today but i and harry monmouth tell me tell me how showed his tasking seemed it in contempt cousin i think thou art enamor\u00e8d on his follies never did i hear of any prince so wild a liberty but be he as he will yet once ere night i will embrace him with a soldier's arm that he shall shrink under my courtesy  arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends better consider what you have to do than i that have not well the gift of tongue can lift your blood up with persuasion i cannot read them now  o gentlemen the time of life is short to spend that shortness basely were too long if life did ride upon a dial's point still ending at the arrival of an hour an if we live we live to tread on kings if die brave death when princes die with us now for our consciences the arms are fair when the intent of bearing them is just i thank him that he cuts me from my tale for i profess not talking only this let each man do his best and here draw i a sword whose temper i intend to stain with the best blood that i can meet withal in the adventure of this perilous day now esperance percy and set on sound all the lofty instruments of war and by that music let us all embrace for heaven to earth some of us never shall a second time do such a courtesy o douglas hadst thou fought at holmedon thus i never had triumphed upon a scot where this douglas no i know this face full well a gallant knight he was his name was blunt semblably furnished like the king himself the king hath many marching in his coats up and away

new earth grates me the sum how my love let rome in tiber melt and the wide arch of the ranged empire fall here is my space kingdoms are clay our dungy earth alike feeds beast as man the nobleness of life is to do thus when such a mutual pair and such a twain can do 't in which i bind on pain of punishment the world to weet we stand up peerless but stirred by cleopatra now for the love of love and her soft hours let's not confound the time with conference harsh there's not a minute of our lives should stretch without some pleasure now what sport tonight fie wrangling queen whom everything becomes to chide to laugh to weep whose every passion fully strives to make itself in thee fair and admired no messenger but thine and all alone tonight we'll wander through the streets and note the qualities of people come my queen last night you did desire it speak not to us against my brother lucius well what worst when it concerns the fool or coward on things that are past are done with me 'tis thus who tells me true though in his tale lie death i hear him as he flattered antony thou wouldst say speak to me home mince not the general tongue name cleopatra as she is called in rome rail thou in fulvia's phrase and taunt my faults with such full license as both truth and malice have power to utter o then we bring forth weeds when our quick winds lie still and our ills told us is as our earing fare thee well awhile from sicyon how the news speak there is there such an one let him appear these strong egyptian fetters i must break or lose myself in dotage what are you where died she forbear me there's a great spirit gone thus did i desire it what our contempts doth often hurl from us we wish it ours again the present pleasure by revolution lowering does become the opposite of itself she's good being gone the hand could pluck her back that shoved her on i must from this enchanting queen break off ten thousand harms more than the ills i know my idleness doth hatch how now enobarbus i must with haste from hence i must be gone she is cunning past man's thought would i had never seen her fulvia is dead fulvia is dead dead the business she hath broach\u00e8d in the state cannot endure my absence no more light answers let our officers have notice what we purpose i shall break the cause of our expedience to the queen and get her leave to part for not alone the death of fulvia with more urgent touches do strongly speak to us but the letters too of many our contriving friends in rome petition us at home sextus pompeius hath given the dare to caesar and commands the empire of the sea our slippery people whose love is never linked to the deserver till his deserts are past begin to throw pompey the great and all his dignities upon his son who high in name and power higher than both in blood and life stands up for the main soldier whose quality going on the sides o' th' world may danger much is breeding which like the courser's hair hath yet but life and not a serpent's poison say our pleasure to such whose place is under us requires our quick remove from hence i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose  now my dearest queen  what's the matter the gods best know  cleopatra  most sweet queen  how now lady hear me queen the strong necessity of time commands our services awhile but my full heart remains in use with you our italy shines o'er with civil swords sextus pompeius makes his approaches to the port of rome equality of two domestic powers breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength are newly grown to love the condemned pompey rich in his father's honor creeps apace into the hearts of such as have not thrived upon the present state whose numbers threaten and quietness grown sick of rest would purge by any desperate change my more particular and that which most with you should safe my going is fulvia's death she's dead my queen look here and at thy sovereign leisure read the garboils she awaked at the last best see when and where she died quarrel no more but be prepared to know the purposes i bear which are or cease as you shall give th' advice by the fire that quickens nilus' slime i go from hence thy soldier servant making peace or war as thou affects my precious queen forbear and give true evidence to his love which stands an honorable trial you'll heat my blood no more now by my sword  i'll leave you lady but that your royalty holds idleness your subject i should take you for idleness itself let us go come our separation so abides and flies that thou residing here goes yet with me and i hence fleeting here remain with thee away if we compose well here to parthia hark ventidius 'tis spoken well were we before our armies and to fight i should do thus thank you sit sir i learn you take things ill which are not so or being concern you not my being in egypt caesar what was 't to you how intend you practiced you do mistake your business my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause of this my letters before did satisfy you if you'll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have to make it with it must not be with this not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain on 't  very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another the third o' th' world is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife so much uncurbable her garboils caesar made out of her impatience which not wanted shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant did you too much disquiet for that you must but say i could not help it sir he fell upon me ere admitted then three kings i had newly feasted and did want of what i was i' th' morning but next day i told him of myself which was as much as to have asked him pardon let this fellow be nothing of our strife if we contend out of our question wipe him no lepidus let him speak the honor is sacred which he talks on now supposing that i lacked it but on caesar the article of my oath neglected rather and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge as nearly as i may i'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness nor my power work without it truth is that fulvia to have me out of egypt made wars here for which myself the ignorant motive do so far ask pardon as befits mine honor to stoop in such a case thou art a soldier only speak no more you wrong this presence therefore speak no more i am not married caesar let me hear agrippa further speak will caesar speak what power is in agrippa if i would say agrippa be it so to make this good may i never to this good purpose that so fairly shows dream of impediment let me have thy hand further this act of grace and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs i did not think to draw my sword 'gainst pompey for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me i must thank him only lest my remembrance suffer ill report at heel of that defy him where lies he what is his strength by land so is the fame would we had spoke together haste we for it yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we the business we have talked of let us lepidus not lack your company the world and my great office will sometimes divide me from your bosom goodnight sir my octavia read not my blemishes in the world's report i have not kept my square but that to come shall all be done by th' rule good night dear lady  good night sir now sirrah you do wish yourself in egypt if you can your reason say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher caesar's or mine speak this no more get thee gone say to ventidius i would speak with him he shall to parthia be it art or hap he hath spoken true the very dice obey him and in our sports my better cunning faints under his chance if we draw lots he speeds his cocks do win the battle still of mine when it is all to naught and his quails ever beat mine inhooped at odds i will to egypt and though i make this marriage for my peace i' th' east my pleasure lies o come ventidius you must to parthia your commission's ready follow me and receive 't thou canst not fear us pompey with thy sails we'll speak with thee at sea at land thou know'st how much we do o'ercount thee which do not be entreated to but weigh what it is worth embraced that's our offer i have heard it pompey and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you the beds i' th' east are soft and thanks to you that called me timelier than my purpose hither for i have gained by 't that will i pompey you have heard much and fair words to them show 's the way sir thus do they sir they take the flow o' th' nile by certain scales i' th' pyramid they know by th' height the lowness or the mean if dearth or foison follow the higher nilus swells the more it promises as it ebbs the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain and shortly comes to harvest ay lepidus they are so it is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is and moves with it own organs it lives by that which nourisheth it and the elements once out of it it transmigrates of it own color too 'tis so and the tears of it are wet with the health that pompey gives him else he is a very epicure these quicksands lepidus keep off them for you sink bear him ashore i'll pledge it for him pompey it ripens towards it strike the vessels ho here's to caesar be a child o' th' time come let's all take hands till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense in soft and delicate lethe cup us till the world go round cup us till the world go round and shall sir give 's your hand no further sir make me not offended in your distrust you shall not find though you be therein curious the least cause for what you seem to fear so the gods keep you and make the hearts of romans serve your ends we will here part the april's in her eyes it is love's spring and these the showers to bring it on be cheerful her tongue will not obey her heart nor can her heart inform her tongue the swan's down feather that stands upon the swell at the full of tide and neither way inclines come sir come i'll wrestle with you in my strength of love look here i have you thus i let you go and give you to the gods farewell nay nay octavia not only that  that were excusable that and thousands more of semblable import but he hath waged new wars 'gainst pompey made his will and read it to public ear spoke scantly of me when perforce he could not but pay me terms of honor cold and sickly he vented them most narrow measure lent me when the best hint was given him he not took 't or did it from his teeth gentle octavia let your best love draw to that point which seeks best to preserve it if i lose mine honor i lose myself better i were not yours than yours so branchless but as you requested yourself shall go between 's the meantime lady i'll raise the preparation of a war shall stain your brother make your soonest haste so your desires are yours when it appears to you where this begins turn your displeasure that way for our faults can never be so equal that your love can equally move with them provide your going choose your own company and command what cost your heart has mind to is it not strange canidius that from tarentum and brundusium he could so quickly cut the ionian sea and take in toryne you have heard on 't sweet a good rebuke which might have well becomed the best of men to taunt at slackness canidius we will fight with him by sea for that he dares us to 't by sea by sea i'll fight at sea our overplus of shipping will we burn and with the rest full manned from th' head of actium beat th' approaching caesar but if we fail we then can do 't at land thy business can he be there in person 'tis impossible strange that his power should be canidius our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land and our twelve thousand horse we'll to our ship  away my thetis how now worthy soldier well well away set we our squadrons on yond side o' th' hill in eye of caesar's battle from which place we may the number of the ships behold and so proceed accordingly hark the land bids me tread no more upon 't it is ashamed to bear me friends come hither i am so lated in the world that i have lost my way forever i have a ship laden with gold take that divide it fly and make your peace with caesar i have fled myself and have instructed cowards to run and show their shoulders friends begone i have myself resolved upon a course which has no need of you begone my treasure's in the harbor take it o i followed that i blush to look upon my very hairs do mutiny for the white reprove the brown for rashness and they them for fear and doting friends begone you shall have letters from me to some friends that will sweep your way for you pray you look not sad nor make replies of loathness take the hint which my despair proclaims let that be left which leaves itself to the seaside straightway i will possess you of that ship and treasure leave me i pray a little pray you now nay do so for indeed i have lost command therefore i pray you i'll see you by and by no no no no no oh fie fie fie yes my lord yes he at philippi kept his sword e'en like a dancer while i struck the lean and wrinkled cassius and 'twas i that the mad brutus ended he alone dealt on lieutenantry and no practice had in the brave squares of war yet now no matter i have offended reputation a most unnoble swerving o whither hast them led me egypt see how i convey my shame out of thine eyes by looking back what i have left behind 'stroyed in dishonor egypt thou knew'st too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings and thou shouldst tow me after o'er my spirit thy full supremacy thou knew'st and that thy beck might from the bidding of the gods command me now i must to the young man send humble treaties dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness who with half the bulk o' th' world played as i pleased making and marring fortunes you did know how much you were my conqueror and that my sword made weak by my affection would obey it on all cause fall not a tear i say one of them rates all that is won and lost give me a kiss even this repays me  we sent our schoolmaster is he come back  love i am full of lead some wine within there and our viands fortune knows we scorn her most when most she offers blows is that his answer the queen shall then have courtesy so she will yield us up let her know 't  to the boy caesar send this grizzled head and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities to him again tell him he wears the rose of youth upon him from which the world should note something particular his coin ships legions may be a coward's whose ministers would prevail under the service of a child as soon as i' th' command of caesar i dare him therefore to lay his gay caparisons apart and answer me declined sword against sword ourselves alone i'll write it follow me favors by jove that thunders what art thou fellow approach there ah you kite now gods and devils authority melts from me of late when i cried ho like boys unto a muss kings would start forth and cry your will have you no ears i am antony yet take hence this jack and whip him moon and stars whip him were 't twenty of the greatest tributaries that do acknowledge caesar should i find them so saucy with the hand of she here what's her name since she was cleopatra whip him fellows till like a boy you see him cringe his face and whine aloud for mercy take him hence tug him away being whipped bring him again this jack of caesar's shall bear us an errand to him you were half blasted ere i knew you ha have i my pillow left unpressed in rome forborne the getting of a lawful race and by a gem of women to be abused by one that looks on feeders you have been a boggler ever but when we in our viciousness grow hard  o misery on 't the wise gods seel our eyes in our own filth drop our clear judgments make us adore our errors laugh at 's while we strut to our confusion i found you as a morsel cold upon dead caesar's trencher nay you were a fragment of gneius pompey's besides what hotter hours unregistered in vulgar fame you have luxuriously picked out for i am sure though you can guess what temperance should be you know not what it is to let a fellow that will take rewards and say god quit you be familiar with my playfellow your hand this kingly seal and plighter of high hearts o that i were upon the hill of basan to outroar the horn\u00e8d herd for i have savage cause and to proclaim it civilly were like a haltered neck which does the hangman thank for being yare about him is he whipped cried he and begged he pardon if that thy father live let him repent thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry to follow caesar in his triumph since thou hast been whipped for following him henceforth the white hand of a lady fever thee shake thou to look on 't get thee back to caesar tell him thy entertainment look thou say he makes me angry with him for he seems proud and disdainful harping on what i am not what he knew i was he makes me angry and at this time most easy 'tis to do 't when my good stars that were my former guides have empty left their orbs and shot their fires into th' abysm of hell if he mislike my speech and what is done tell him he has hipparchus my enfranch\u00e8d bondman whom he may at pleasure whip or hang or torture as he shall like to quit me urge it thou hence with thy stripes begone alack our terrene moon is now eclipsed and it portends alone the fall of antony to flatter caesar would you

york before i see thee seated in that throne which now the house of lancaster usurps i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close this is the palace of the fearful king and this the regal seat possess it york for this is thine and not king henry's heirs' and when the king comes offer him no violence unless he seek to thrust you out perforce the bloody parliament shall this be called unless plantagenet duke of york be king and bashful henry deposed whose cowardice hath made us bywords to our enemies neither the king nor he that loves him best the proudest he that holds up lancaster dares stir a wing if warwick shake his bells i'll plant plantagenet root him up who dares resolve thee richard claim the english crown exeter thou art a traitor to the crown in following this usurping henry true clifford that's richard duke of york be duke of lancaster let him be king and warwick shall disprove it you forget that we are those which chased you from the field and slew your fathers and with colors spread marched through the city to the palace gates poor clifford how i scorn his worthless threats talk not of france sith thou hast lost it all plantagenet shall speak first hear him lords and be you silent and attentive too for he that interrupts him shall not live prove it henry and thou shalt be king suppose my lords he did it unconstrained think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown deposed he shall be in despite of all do right unto this princely duke of york or i will fill the house with arm\u00e8d men and over the chair of state where now he sits write up his title with usurping blood what good is this to england and himself turn this way henry and regard them not why should you sigh my lord long live king henry plantagenet embrace him and i'll keep london with my soldiers how now fair lords what fare what news abroad ten days ago i drowned these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befall'n after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i then in london keeper of the king mustered my soldiers gathered flocks of friends marched toward saint albans to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertis\u00e8d that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henry's oath and your succession short tale to make we at saint albans met our battles joined and both sides fiercely fought but whether 'twas the coldness of the king who looked full gently on his warlike queen that robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether 'twas report of her success or more than common fear of clifford's rigor who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers' like the night owl's lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheered them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste posthaste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henry's head and wring the awful scepter from his fist were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague attend me lords the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many more proud birds have wrought the easy melting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enroll\u00e8d in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster their power i think is thirty thousand strong now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via to london will we march and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and fly no longer earl of march but duke of york the next degree is england's royal throne for king of england shalt thou be proclaimed in every borough as we pass along and he that throws not up his cap for joy shall for the fault make forfeit of his head king edward valiant richard montague stay we no longer dreaming of renown but sound the trumpets and about our task how now what news why then it sorts brave warriors let's away what sayst thou henry wilt thou yield the crown then 'twas my turn to fly and now 'tis thine 'twas not your valor clifford drove me thence if thou deny their blood upon thy head for york in justice puts his armor on forspent with toil as runners with a race i lay me down a little while to breathe for strokes received and many blows repaid have robbed my strong knit sinews of their strength and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile how now my lord what hap what hope of good then let the earth be drunken with our blood i'll kill my horse because i will not fly why stand we like soft hearted women here wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage and look upon as if the tragedy were played in jest by counterfeiting actors here on my knee i vow to god above i'll never pause again never stand still till either death hath closed these eyes of mine or fortune given me measure of revenge away away once more sweet lords farewell no 'tis impossible he should escape for though before his face i speak the words your brother richard marked him for the grave and wheresoe'er he is he's surely dead from off the gates of york fetch down the head your father's head which clifford plac\u00e8d there instead whereof let this supply the room measure for measure must be answer\u00e8d i think his understanding is bereft  speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee  dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say clifford devise excuses for thy faults they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont ay but he's dead off with the traitor's head and rear it in the place your father's stands and now to london with triumphant march there to be crown\u00e8d england's royal king from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france and ask the lady bona for thy queen so shalt thou sinew both these lands together and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread the scattered foe that hopes to rise again for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears first will i see the coronation and then to brittany i'll cross the sea to effect this marriage so it please my lord tut that's a foolish observation richard be duke of gloucester now to london to see these honors in possession from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vow\u00e8d friend i come in kindness and unfeign\u00e8d love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to england's king in lawful marriage and gracious madam in our king's behalf i am commanded with your leave and favor humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereign's heart where fame late ent'ring at his heedful ears hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue injurious margaret because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more art prince than she is queen oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry the fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdom's worth can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king and i the house of york thereon i pawn my credit and mine honor the more that henry was unfortunate such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fixed in virtue's ground the leaves and fruit maintained with beauty's sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing nothing can he lose  and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better 'twere you troubled him than france mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edward's  no more my king for he dishonors me but most himself if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death did i let pass th' abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdoned at the last with shame shame on himself for my desert is honor and to repair my honor lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state so much his friend ay his unfeign\u00e8d friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers i'll undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war 'tis not his new made bride shall succor him and as for clarence as my letters tell me he's very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honor or than for strength and safety of our country and mine fair lady bona joins with yours tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i'll uncrown him ere 't be long there's thy reward be gone this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree i'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raised him to the crown and i'll be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henry's misery but seek revenge on edward's mockery trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us but see where somerset and clarence comes  speak suddenly my lords are we all friends then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawned an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edward's brother were but a feign\u00e8d friend to our proceedings but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in night's coverture thy brother being carelessly encamped his soldiers lurking in the town about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomed with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus' tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well covered with the night's black mantle at unawares may beat down edward's guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader why then let's on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends god and saint george this is his tent and see where stand his guard courage my masters honor now or never but follow me and edward shall be ours richard and hastings let them go here is the duke ay but the case is altered when you disgraced me in my embassade then i degraded you from being king and come now to create you duke of york alas how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassadors nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the people's welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies then for his mind be edward england's king but henry now shall wear the english crown and be true king indeed thou but the shadow  my lord of somerset at my request see that forthwith duke edward be conveyed unto my brother archbishop of york when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows i'll follow you and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him  now for awhile farewell good duke of york ay that's the first thing that we have to do to free king henry from imprisonment and see him seated in the regal throne your grace hath still been famed for virtuous and now may seem as wise as virtuous by spying and avoiding fortune's malice for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace for choosing me when clarence is in place and i choose clarence only for protector what answers clarence to his sovereign's will why then though loath yet must i be content we'll yoke together like a double shadow to henry's body and supply his place  i mean in bearing weight of government  while he enjoys the honor and his ease and clarence now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor and all his lands and goods be confiscate ay therein clarence shall not want his part what news my friend unsavory news but how made he escape my brother was too careless of his charge but let us hence my sovereign to provide a salve for any sore that may betide what counsel lords edward from belgia with hasty germans and blunt hollanders hath passed in safety through the narrow seas and with his troops doth march amain to london and many giddy people flock to him in warwickshire i have true hearted friends not mutinous in peace yet bold in war those will i muster up and thou son clarence shalt stir up in suffolk norfolk and in kent the knights and gentlemen to come with thee  thou brother montague in buckingham northampton and in leicestershire shalt find men well inclined to hear what thou command'st  and thou brave oxford wondrous well beloved in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends  my sovereign with the loving citizens like to his island girt in with the ocean or modest dian circled with her nymphs shall rest in london till we come to him fair lords take leave and stand not to reply  farewell my sovereign farewell sweet lords let's meet at coventry where is the post that came from valiant oxford  how far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow how far off is our brother montague where is the post that came from montague say somerville what says my loving son and by thy guess how nigh is clarence now then clarence is at hand i hear his drum who should that be belike unlooked for friends o unbid spite is sportful edward come where slept our scouts or how are they seduced that we could hear no news of his repair nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence confess who set thee up and plucked thee down call warwick patron and be penitent and thou shalt still remain the duke of york is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift 'twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother thou art no atlas for so great a weight and weakling warwick takes his gift again and henry is my king warwick his subject i had rather chop this hand off at a blow and with the other fling it at thy face than bear so low a sail to strike to thee o cheerful colors see where oxford comes o welcome oxford for we want thy help and lo where george of clarence sweeps along of force enough to bid his brother battle with whom an upright zeal to right prevails more than the nature of a brother's love  come clarence come thou wilt if warwick call o passing traitor perjured and unjust alas i am not cooped here for defense i will away towards barnet presently and bid thee battle edward if thou dar'st ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe and tell me who is victor york or warwick why ask i that my mangled body shows my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows that i must yield my body to the earth and by my fall the conquest to my foe thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle under whose shade the ramping lion slept whose top branch overpeered jove's spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind these eyes that now are dimmed with death's black veil have been as piercing as the midday sun to search the secret treasons of the world the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood were likened oft to kingly sepulchers for who lived king but i could dig his grave and who durst smile when warwick bent his brow lo now my glory smeared in dust and blood my parks my walks my manors that i had even now forsake me and of all my lands is nothing left me but my body's length why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust and live we how we can yet die we must why then i would not fly ah montague if thou be there sweet brother take my hand and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile thou lov'st me not for brother if thou didst thy tears would wash this cold congeal\u00e8d blood that glues my lips and will not let me speak come quickly montague or i am dead sweet rest his soul fly

indeed a sheep doth very often stray an if the shepherd be awhile away i do a silly answer and fitting well a sheep true and thy master a shepherd it shall go hard but i'll prove it by another the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep but dost thou hear gav'st thou my letter to julia here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons nay in that you are astray 'twere best pound you you mistake i mean the pound a pinfold but what said she nod ay why that's noddy and that set together is noddy no no you shall have it for bearing the letter why sir how do you bear with me beshrew me but you have a quick wit come come open the matter in brief what said she well sir here is for your pains what said she why couldst thou perceive so much from her what said she nothing go go begone to save your ship from wrack which cannot perish having thee aboard

deliberate a day or two thus have i shunned the fire for fear of burning and drenched me in the sea where i am drowned i feared to show my father julia's letter lest he should take exceptions to my love and with the vantage of mine own excuse hath he excepted most against my love o how this spring of love resembleth the uncertain glory of an april day which now shows all the beauty of the sun and by and by a cloud takes all away why this it is my heart accords thereto and yet a thousand times it answers no have patience gentle julia when possibly i can i will return why then we'll make exchange here take you this here is my hand for my true constancy and when that hour o'erslips me in the day wherein i sigh not julia for thy sake the next ensuing hour some foul mischance torment me for my love's forgetfulness my father stays my coming answer not the tide is now nay not thy tide of tears that tide will stay me longer than i should julia farewell what gone without a word ay so true love should do it cannot speak for truth hath better deeds than words to grace it go i come i come alas this parting strikes poor lovers dumb not so sweet lady but too mean a servant to have a look of such a worthy mistress my duty will i boast of nothing else i'll die on him that says so but yourself that you are worthless we'll both attend upon your ladyship your friends are well and have them much commended i left them all in health my tales of love were wont to weary you i know you joy not in a love discourse enough i read your fortune in your eye was this the idol that you worship so no but she is an earthly paragon i will not flatter her when i was sick you gave me bitter pills and i must minister the like to you except my mistress have i not reason to prefer mine own why valentine what braggartism is this then let her alone but she loves you go on before i shall inquire you forth i must unto the road to disembark some necessaries that i needs must use and then i'll presently attend you i will even as one heat another heat expels or as one nail by strength drives out another so the remembrance of my former love is by a newer object quite forgotten is it mine eye or valentine's praise her true perfection or my false transgression that makes me reasonless to reason thus she is fair and so is julia that i love  that i did love for now my love is thawed which like a waxen image 'gainst a fire bears no impression of the thing it was methinks my zeal to valentine is cold and that i love him not as i was wont o but i love his lady too too much and that's the reason i love him so little how shall i dote on her with more advice that thus without advice begin to love her 'tis but her picture i have yet beheld and that hath dazzled my reason's light but when i look on her perfections there is no reason but i shall be blind if i can check my erring love i will if not to compass her i'll use my skill to leave my julia shall i be forsworn to love fair sylvia shall i be forsworn to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn and ev'n that power which gave me first my oath provokes me to this threefold perjury love bade me swear and love bids me forswear o sweet suggesting love if thou hast sinned teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it at first i did adore a twinkling star but now i worship a celestial sun unheedful vows may heedfully be broken and he wants wit that wants resolv\u00e8d will to learn his wit t' exchange the bad for better fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferred with twenty thousand soul confirming oaths i cannot leave to love and yet i do but there i leave to love where i should love julia i lose and valentine i lose if i keep them i needs must lose myself if i lose them thus find i by their loss for valentine myself for julia sylvia i to myself am dearer than a friend for love is still most precious in itself and sylvia witness heaven that made her fair  shows julia but a swarthy ethiope i will forget that julia is alive rememb'ring that my love to her is dead and valentine i'll hold an enemy aiming at sylvia as a sweeter friend i cannot now prove constant to myself without some treachery used to valentine this night he meaneth with a corded ladder to climb celestial sylvia's chamber window myself in counsel his competitor now presently i'll give her father notice of their disguising and pretended flight who all enraged will banish valentine for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter but valentine being gone i'll quickly cross by some sly trick blunt thurio's dull proceeding love lend me wings to make my purpose swift as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift my gracious lord that which i would discover the law of friendship bids me to conceal but when i call to mind your gracious favors done to me undeserving as i am my duty pricks me on to utter that which else no worldly good should draw from me know worthy prince sir valentine my friend this night intends to steal away your daughter myself am one made privy to the plot i know you have determined to bestow her on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates and should she thus be stol'n away from you it would be much vexation to your age thus for my duty's sake i rather chose to cross my friend in his intended drift than by concealing it heap on your head a pack of sorrows which would press you down being unprevented to your timeless grave know noble lord they have devised a mean how he her chamber window will ascend and with a corded ladder fetch her down for which the youthful lover now is gone and this way comes he with it presently where if it please you you may intercept him but good my lord do it so cunningly that my discovery be not aim\u00e8d at for love of you not hate unto my friend hath made me publisher of this pretense adieu my lord sir valentine is coming run boy run run and seek him out what seest thou valentine who then his spirit what then who wouldst thou strike villain forbear sirrah i say forbear friend valentine a word then in dumb silence will i bury mine for they are harsh untunable and bad no valentine no valentine that thou art banish\u00e8d o that's the news  from hence from sylvia and from me thy friend ay ay and she hath offered to the doom  which unreversed stands in effectual force  a sea of melting pearl which some call tears those at her father's churlish feet she tendered with them upon her knees her humble self wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them as if but now they wax\u00e8d pale for woe but neither bended knees pure hands held up sad sighs deep groans nor silver shedding tears could penetrate her uncompassionate sire but valentine if he be ta'en must die besides her intercession chafed him so when she for thy repeal was suppliant that to close prison he commanded her with many bitter threats of biding there cease to lament for that thou canst not help and study help for that which thou lament'st time is the nurse and breeder of all good here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love besides thy staying will abridge thy life hope is a lover's staff walk hence with that and manage it against despairing thoughts thy letters may be here though thou art hence which being writ to me shall be delivered even in the milk white bosom of thy love the time now serves not to expostulate come i'll convey thee through the city gate and ere i part with thee confer at large of all that may concern thy love affairs as thou lov'st sylvia though not for thyself regard thy danger and along with me go sirrah find him out come valentine gone my good lord a little time my lord will kill that grief longer than i prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace i do my lord she did my lord when valentine was here the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood cowardice and poor descent three things that women highly hold in hate ay if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend and that my lord i shall be loath to do 'tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend you have prevailed my lord if i can do it by aught that i can speak in his dispraise she shall not long continue love to him but say this weed her love from valentine it follows not that she will love sir thurio as much as i can do i will effect  but you sir thurio are not sharp enough you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets whose compos\u00e8d rhymes should be full fraught with serviceable vows say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart write till your ink be dry and with your tears moist it again and frame some feeling line that may discover such integrity for orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews whose golden touch could soften steel and stones make tigers tame and huge leviathans forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands after your dire lamenting elegies visit by night your lady's chamber window with some sweet consort to their instruments tune a deploring dump the night's dead silence will well become such sweet complaining grievance this or else nothing will inherit her we'll wait upon your grace till after supper and afterward determine our proceedings already have i been false to valentine and now i must be as unjust to thurio under the color of commending him i have access my own love to prefer but sylvia is too fair too true too holy to be corrupted with my worthless gifts when i protest true loyalty to her she twits me with my falsehood to my friend when to her beauty i commend my vows she bids me think how i have been forsworn in breaking faith with julia whom i loved and notwithstanding all her sudden quips the least whereof would quell a lover's hope yet spaniel like the more she spurns my love the more it grows and fawneth on her still but here comes thurio now must we to her window and give some evening music to her ear ay gentle thurio for you know that love will creep in service where it cannot go sir but i do or else i would be hence ay sylvia for your sake who is sylvia what is she that all our swains commend her holy fair and wise is she the heaven such grace did lend her that she might admir\u00e8d be is she kind as she is fair for beauty lives with kindness love doth to her eyes repair to help him of his blindness and being helped inhabits there then to sylvia let us sing that sylvia is excelling she excels each mortal thing upon the dull earth dwelling to her let us garlands bring sir thurio fear not you i will so plead that you shall say my cunning drift excels at saint gregory's well madam good even to your ladyship one lady if you knew his pure

beauteous ladies' eyes ill when you talk of war o sir she makes no doubt of that that you are well derived o ay and pities them that they are out by lease nor i neither and i will follow more for sylvia's love than hate of eglamour that goes with her madam this service i have done for you  though you respect not aught your servant doth  to hazard life and rescue you from him that would have forced your honor and your love vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look a smaller boon than this i cannot beg and less than this i am sure you cannot give unhappy were you madam ere i came but by my coming i have made you happy what dangerous action stood it next to death would i not undergo for one calm look o 'tis the curse in love and still approved when women cannot love where they're beloved in love who respects friend nay if the gentle spirit of moving words can no way change you to a milder form i'll woo you like a soldier at arms' end and love you 'gainst the nature of love force you i'll force thee yield to my desire valentine my shame and guilt confounds me forgive me valentine if hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offense i tender 't here i do as truly suffer as e'er i did commit look to the boy where is that ring boy how let me see why this is the ring i gave to julia but how cam'st thou by this ring at my depart i gave this unto julia how julia than men their minds 'tis true o heaven were man but constant he were perfect that one error fills him with faults makes him run through all th' sins inconstancy falls off ere it begins what is in sylvia's face but i may spy more fresh in julia's with a constant eye bear witness heaven i have my wish forever", "R3_Buckingham": "good time of day unto your royal grace madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully ay madam he desires to make atonement between the duke of gloucester and your brothers and between them and my lord chamberlain and sent to warn them to his royal presence northumberland then present wept to see it peace peace for shame if not for charity have done have done nor no one here for curses never pass the lips of those that breathe them in the air nothing that i respect my gracious lord my hair doth stand an end to hear her curses whenever buckingham doth turn his hate upon your grace but with all duteous love doth cherish you and yours god punish me with hate in those where i expect most love when i have most need to employ a friend and most assur\u00e8d that he is a friend deep hollow treacherous and full of guile be he unto me this do i beg of god when i am cold in love to you or yours and in good time here comes sir richard ratcliffe and the duke look i so pale lord dorset as the rest we wait upon your grace you cloudy princes and heart sorrowing peers that bear this heavy mutual load of moan now cheer each other in each other's love though we have spent our harvest of this king we are to reap the harvest of his son the broken rancor of your high swoll'n hates but lately splintered knit and joined together must gently be preserved cherished and kept meseemeth good that with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fet hither to london to be crowned our king marry my lord lest by a multitude the new healed wound of malice should break out which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and yet ungoverned where every horse bears his commanding rein and may direct his course as please himself as well the fear of harm as harm apparent in my opinion ought to be prevented my lord whoever journeys to the prince for god's sake let not us two stay at home for by the way i'll sort occasion as index to the story we late talked of to part the queen's proud kindred from the prince welcome sweet prince to london to your chamber and in good time here comes the sweating lord fie what an indirect and peevish course is this of hers lord cardinal will your grace persuade the queen to send the duke of york unto his princely brother presently  if she deny lord hastings go with him and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce you are too senseless obstinate my lord too ceremonious and traditional weigh it but with the grossness of this age you break not sanctuary in seizing him the benefit thereof is always granted to those whose dealings have deserved the place and those who have the wit to claim the place this prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it then taking him from thence that is not there you break no privilege nor charter there oft have i heard of sanctuary men but sanctuary children never till now he did my gracious lord begin that place which since succeeding ages have re edified upon record my gracious lord what my gracious lord now in good time here comes the duke of york with what a sharp provided wit he reasons to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle he prettily and aptly taunts himself so cunning and so young is wonderful think you my lord this little prating york was not incens\u00e8d by his subtle mother to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously well let them rest come hither catesby thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend as closely to conceal what we impart thou knowest our reasons urged upon the way what thinkest thou is it not an easy matter to make william lord hastings of our mind for the installment of this noble duke in the seat royal of this famous isle what think'st thou then of stanley will not he well then no more but this go gentle catesby and as it were far off sound thou lord hastings how he doth stand affected to our purpose and summon him tomorrow to the tower to sit about the coronation if thou dost find him tractable to us encourage him and tell him all our reasons if he be leaden icy cold unwilling be thou so too and so break off the talk and give us notice of his inclination for we tomorrow hold divided councils wherein thyself shalt highly be employed good catesby go effect this business soundly now my lord what shall we do if we perceive lord hastings will not yield to our complots i'll claim that promise at your grace's hand what talking with a priest lord chamberlain your friends at pomfret they do need the priest your honor hath no shriving work in hand i do my lord but long i cannot stay there i shall return before your lordship thence and supper too although thou know'st it not  come will you go is all things ready for the royal time who knows the lord protector's mind herein who is most inward with the noble duke we know each other's faces for our hearts he knows no more of mine than i of yours or i of his my lord than you of mine  lord hastings you and he are near in love had you not come upon your cue my lord william lord hastings had pronounced your part  i mean your voice for crowning of the king withdraw yourself awhile i'll go with you tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian speak and look back and pry on every side tremble and start at wagging of a straw intending deep suspicion ghastly looks are at my service like enforc\u00e8d smiles and both are ready in their offices at any time to grace my stratagems but what is catesby gone lord mayor  hark a drum lord mayor the reason we have sent  god and our innocence defend and guard us well well he was the covert'st sheltered traitor that ever lived  would you imagine or almost believe were 't not that by great preservation we live to tell it that the subtle traitor this day had plotted in the council house to murder me and my good lord of gloucester i never looked for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore yet had we not determined he should die until your lordship came to see his end which now the loving haste of these our friends something against our meanings have prevented because my lord i would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treasons that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens who haply may misconster us in him and wail his death which since you come too late of our intent yet witness what you hear we did intend and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell doubt not my lord i'll play the orator as if the golden fee for which i plead were for myself and so my lord adieu i go and towards three or four o'clock look for the news that the guildhall affords now by the holy mother of our lord the citizens are mum say not a word i did with his contract with lady lucy and his contract by deputy in france th' unsatiate greediness of his desire and his enforcement of the city wives his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy as being got your father then in france and his resemblance being not like the duke withal i did infer your lineaments being the right idea of your father both in your form and nobleness of mind laid open all your victories in scotland your discipline in war wisdom in peace your bounty virtue fair humility indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose untouched or slightly handled in discourse and when mine oratory drew toward end i bid them that did love their country's good cry god save richard england's royal king no so god help me they spake not a word but like dumb statues or breathing stones stared each on other and looked deadly pale which when i saw i reprehended them and asked the mayor what meant this willful silence his answer was the people were not used to be spoke to but by the recorder then he was urged to tell my tale again thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferred  but nothing spoke in warrant from himself when he had done some followers of mine own at lower end of the hall hurled up their caps and some ten voices cried god save king richard and thus i took the vantage of those few thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i this general applause and cheerful shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard  and even here brake off and came away the mayor is here at hand intend some fear be not you spoke with but by mighty suit and look you get a prayer book in your hand and stand between two churchmen good my lord for on that ground i'll make a holy descant and be not easily won to our requests play the maid's part still answer nay and take it go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks welcome my lord i dance attendance here i think the duke will not be spoke withal now catesby what says your lord to my request return good catesby to the gracious duke tell him myself the mayor and aldermen in deep designs in matter of great moment no less importing than our general good are come to have some conference with his grace ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward he is not lolling on a lewd love bed but on his knees at meditation not dallying with a brace of courtesans but meditating with two deep divines not sleeping to engross his idle body but praying to enrich his watchful soul happy were england would this virtuous prince take on his grace the sovereignty thereof but sure i fear we shall not win him to it i fear he will here catesby comes again now catesby what says his grace sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him by heaven we come to him in perfect love and so once more return and tell his grace when holy and devout religious men are at their beads 'tis much to draw them thence so sweet is zealous contemplation two props of virtue for a christian prince to stay him from the fall of vanity and see a book of prayer in his hand true ornaments to know a holy man  famous plantagenet most gracious prince lend favorable ear to our requests and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal even that i hope which pleaseth god above and all good men of this ungoverned isle you have my lord would it might please your grace on our entreaties to amend your fault know then it is your fault that you resign the supreme seat the throne majestical the sceptered office of your ancestors your state of fortune and your due of birth the lineal glory of your royal house to the corruption of a blemished stock whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts which here we waken to our country's good the noble isle doth want her proper limbs  her face defaced with scars of infamy her royal stock graft with ignoble plants and almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion which to recure we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land not as protector steward substitute or lowly factor for another's gain but as successively from blood to blood your right of birth your empery your own for this consorted with the citizens your very worshipful and loving friends and by their vehement instigation in this just cause come i to move your grace my lord this argues conscience in your grace but the respects thereof are nice and trivial all circumstances well consider\u00e8d you say that edward is your brother's son so say we too but not by edward's wife for first was he contract to lady lucy  your mother lives a witness to his vow  and afterward by substitute betrothed to bona sister to the king of france these both put off a poor petitioner a care crazed mother to a many sons a beauty waning and distress\u00e8d widow even in the afternoon of her best days made prize and purchase of his wanton eye seduced the pitch and height of his degree to base declension and loathed bigamy by her in his unlawful bed he got this edward whom our manners call the prince more bitterly could i expostulate save that for reverence to some alive i give a sparing limit to my tongue then good my lord take to your royal self this proffered benefit of dignity if not to bless us and the land withal yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal true deriv\u00e8d course refuse not mighty lord this proffered love if you refuse it as in love and zeal loath to depose the child your brother's son  as well we know your tenderness of heart and gentle kind effeminate remorse which we have noted in you to your kindred and equally indeed to all estates  yet know whe'er you accept our suit or no your brother's son shall never reign our king but we will plant some other in the throne to the disgrace and downfall of your house and in this resolution here we leave you  come citizens zounds i'll entreat no more then i salute you with this royal title long live richard england's worthy king tomorrow may it please you to be crowned tomorrow then we will attend your grace and so most joyfully we take our leave my gracious sovereign still live they and forever let them last say on my loving lord why so you are my thrice renown\u00e8d lord true noble prince your grace may do your pleasure give me some little breath some pause dear lord before i positively speak in this i will resolve you herein presently my lord i have considered in my mind the late request that you did sound me in i hear the news my lord my lord i claim the gift my due by promise for which your honor and your faith is pawned  th' earldom of hereford and the movables which you have promis\u00e8d i shall possess what says your highness to my just request my lord  my lord your promise for the earldom  my lord  i am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promised me upon the stroke of ten why let it strike why then resolve me whether you will or no and is it thus repays he my deep service with such contempt made i him king for this o let me think on hastings and be gone to brecknock while my fearful head is on will not king richard let me speak with him hastings and edward's children grey and rivers holy king henry and thy fair son edward vaughan and all that have miscarri\u00e8d by underhand corrupted foul injustice if that your moody discontented souls do through the clouds behold this present hour even for revenge mock my destruction  this is all souls' day fellow is it not why then all souls' day is my body's doomsday this is the day which in king edward's time i wished might fall on me when i was found false to his children and his wife's allies this is the day wherein i wished to fall by the false faith of him whom most i trusted this this all souls' day to my fearful soul is the determined respite of my wrongs that high all seer which i dallied with hath turned my feign\u00e8d prayer on my head and given in earnest what i begged in jest thus doth he force the swords of wicked men to turn their own points in their masters' bosoms thus margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck when he quoth she shall split thy heart with sorrow remember margaret was a prophetess  come lead me officers to the block of shame wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame the first was i that helped thee to the crown the last was i that felt thy tyranny o in the battle think on buckingham and die in terror of thy guiltiness dream on dream on of bloody deeds and death fainting despair despairing yield thy breath i died for hope ere i could lend thee aid but cheer thy heart

didst thou ever know beloved i understand thee thou hadst some means to keep a dog women nearest but men men are the things themselves what wouldst thou do with the world apemantus if it lay in thy power wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men and remain a beast with the beasts a beastly ambition which the gods grant thee t' attain to if thou wert the lion the fox would beguile thee if thou wert the lamb the fox would eat thee if thou wert the fox the lion would suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass if thou wert the ass thy dullness would torment thee and still thou lived'st but as a breakfast to the wolf if thou wert the wolf thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner wert thou the unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury wert thou a bear thou wouldst be killed by the horse wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seized by the leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert germane to the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life all thy safety were remotion and thy defense absence what beast couldst thou be that were not subject to a

false world and will love nought but even the mere necessities upon 't then timon presently prepare thy grave lie where the light foam of the sea may beat thy gravestone daily make thine epitaph that death in me at others' lives may laugh o thou sweet king killer and dear divorce 'twixt natural son and sire thou bright defiler of hymen's purest bed thou valiant mars thou ever young fresh loved and delicate wooer whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow that lies on dian's lap thou visible god that sold'rest close impossibilities and mak'st them kiss that speak'st with every tongue to every purpose o thou touch of hearts think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue set them into confounding odds that beasts may have the world in empire thronged to thy back i prithee long live so and so die i am quit now thieves both too and women's sons your greatest want is you want much of meat why should you want behold the earth hath roots within this mile break forth a hundred springs the oaks bear mast the briars scarlet hips the bounteous huswife nature on each bush lays her full mess before you want why want nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes you must eat men yet thanks i must you con that you are thieves professed that you work not in holier shapes for there is boundless theft in limited professions rascal thieves here's gold go suck the subtle blood o' th' grape till the high fever seethe your blood to froth and so 'scape hanging trust not the physician his antidotes are poison and he slays more than you rob take wealth and lives together do villainy do since you protest to do 't like workmen i'll example you with thievery the sun's a thief and with his great attraction robs the vast sea the moon's an arrant thief and her pale fire she snatches from the sun the sea's a thief whose liquid surge resolves the moon into salt tears the earth's a thief that feeds and breeds by a composture stol'n from gen'ral excrement each thing's a thief the laws your curb and whip in their rough power has unchecked theft love not yourselves away rob one another there's more goldcut throats all that you meet are thieves to athens go break open shops nothing can you steal but thieves do lose it steal less for this i give you and gold confound you howsoe'er amen away what art thou why dost ask that i have forgot all men then if thou grant'st thou 'rt a man i have forgot thee then i know thee not i never had honest man about me i all i kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains what dost thou weep come nearer then i love thee because thou art a woman and disclaim'st flinty mankind whose eyes do never give but thorough lust and laughter pity's sleeping strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping had i a steward so true so just and now so comfortable it almost turns my dangerous nature mild let me behold thy face surely this man was born of woman forgive my general and exceptless rashness you perpetual sober gods i do proclaim one honest man mistake me not but one no more i pray and he's a steward how fain would i have hated all mankind and thou redeem'st thyself but all save thee i fell with curses methinks thou art more honest now than wise for by oppressing and betraying me thou mightst have sooner got another service for many so arrive at second masters upon their first lord's neck but tell me true  for i must ever doubt though ne'er so sure  is not thy kindness subtle covetous a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts expecting in return twenty for one look thee 'tis so thou singly honest man here take the gods out of my misery has sent thee treasure go live rich and happy but thus conditioned thou shalt build from men hate all curse all show charity to none but let the famished flesh slide from the bone ere thou relieve the beggar give to dogs what thou deniest to men let prisons swallow 'em debts wither 'em to nothing be men like blasted woods and may diseases lick up their false bloods and so farewell and thrive if thou hat'st curses stay not fly whilst thou art blest and free ne'er see thou man and let me ne'er see thee excellent workman thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men do so i have gold for thee i'll meet you at the turn what a god's gold that he is worshiped in a baser temple than where swine feed 'tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plow'st the foam settlest admir\u00e8d reverence in a slave to thee be worship and thy saints for aye be crowned with plagues that thee alone obey fit i meet them have i once lived to see two honest men let it go naked men may see 't the better you that are honest by being what you are make them best seen and known ay you are honest men most honest men why how shall i requite you can you eat roots and drink cold water no you're honest men you've heard that i have gold i am sure you have speak truth you're honest men good honest men thou draw'st a counterfeit best in all athens thou 'rt indeed the best thou counterfeit'st most lively e'en so sir as i say and for thy fiction why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth that thou art even natural in thine art but for all this my honest natured friends i must needs say you have a little fault marry 'tis not monstrous in you neither wish i you take much pains to mend you'll take it ill will you indeed there's never a one of you but trusts a knave that mightily deceives you ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble know his gross patchery love him feed him keep in your bosom yet remain assured that he's a made up villain look you i love you well i'll give you gold rid me these villains from your companies hang them or stab them drown them in a draft confound them by some course and come to me i'll give you gold enough you that way and you this but two in company each man apart all single and alone yet an archvillain keeps him company if where thou art two villains shall not be come not near him if thou wouldst not reside but where one villain is then him abandon  hence pack there's gold you came for gold you slaves you have work for me there's payment hence you are an alchemist make gold of that out rascal dogs thou sun that comforts burn speak and be hanged for each true word a blister and each false be as a cauterizing to the root o' th' tongue consuming it with speaking of none but such as you and you of timon i thank them and would send them back the plague could i but catch it for them you witch me in it surprise me to the very brink of tears lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes and i'll beweep these comforts worthy senators well sir i will therefore i will sir thus if alcibiades kill my countrymen let alcibiades know this of timon  that timon cares not but if he sack fair athens and take our goodly ag\u00e8d men by th' beards giving our holy virgins to the stain of contumelious beastly mad brained war then let him know and tell him timon speaks it in pity of our ag\u00e8d and our youth i cannot choose but tell him that i care not and let him take 't at worst for their knives care not while you have throats to answer for myself there's not a whittle in th' unruly camp but i do prize it at my love before the reverend'st throat in athens so i leave you to the protection of the prosperous gods as thieves to keepers why i was writing of my epitaph it will be seen tomorrow my long sickness of health and living now begins to mend and nothing brings me all things go live still be alcibiades your plague you his and last so long enough but yet i love my country and am not one that rejoices in the common wrack as common bruit doth put it commend me to my loving countrymen commend me to them and tell them that to ease them of their griefs their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses their pangs of love with other incident throes that nature's fragile vessel doth sustain in life's uncertain voyage i will some kindness do them i'll teach them to prevent wild alcibiades' wrath i have a tree which grows here in my close that mine own use invites me to cut down and shortly must i fell it tell my friends tell athens in the sequence of degree from high to low throughout that whoso please to stop affliction let him take his haste come hither ere my tree hath felt the ax and hang himself i pray you do my greeting come not to me again but say to athens timon hath made his everlasting mansion upon the beach\u00e8d verge of the salt flood who once a day with his emboss\u00e8d froth the turbulent surge shall cover thither come and let my gravestone be your oracle lips let four words go by and language end what is amiss plague and infection mend graves only be men's works

and wrinkled deep in time broad fronted caesar when thou wast here above the ground i was a morsel for a monarch and great pompey would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow there would he anchor his aspect and die with looking on his life how much unlike art thou mark antony yet coming from him that great med'cine hath with his tinct gilded thee how goes it with my brave mark antony mine ear must pluck it thence what was he sad or merry o well divided disposition note him note him good charmian 'tis the man but note him he was not sad for he would shine on those that make their looks by

tires and mantles on him whilst i wore his sword philippan o from italy ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears that long time have been barren antonio's dead if thou say so villain thou kill'st thy mistress but well and free if thou so yield him there is gold and here my bluest veins to kiss a hand that kings have lipped and trembled kissing why there's more gold but sirrah mark we use to say the dead are well bring it to that the gold i give thee will i melt and pour down thy ill uttering throat well go to i will but there's no goodness in thy face if antony be free and healthful so

this dull world which in thy absence is no better than a sty o see my women the crown o' th' earth doth melt my lord o withered is the garland of the war the soldier's pole is fall'n young boys and girls are level now with men the odds is gone and there is nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting moon no more but e'en a woman and commanded by such poor passion as the maid that milks and does the meanest chares it were for me to throw my scepter at the injurious gods to tell them that this world did equal theirs till they had stolen our jewel all's but naught patience is sottish and impatience does become a dog that's mad then is it sin to rush into the secret house of death ere death dare come to us how do you women what what good cheer why how now charmian my noble girls ah women women look our lamp is spent it's out good sirs take heart we'll bury him and then what's brave what's noble let's do 't after the high roman fashion and make death proud to take us come away this case of that huge spirit now is cold ah women women come we have no friend but resolution and the briefest end my desolation does begin to make a better life 'tis paltry to be caesar not being fortune he's but fortune's knave a minister of her will and it is great to do that thing that ends all other deeds which shackles accidents and bolts up change which sleeps and never palates more the dung the beggar's nurse and caesar's what's thy name antony did tell me of you bade me trust you but i do not greatly care to be deceived that have no use for trusting if your master would have a queen his beggar you must tell him that majesty to keep decorum must no less beg than a kingdom if he please to give me conquered egypt for my son he gives me so much of mine own as i will kneel to him with thanks pray you tell him i am his fortune's vassal and i send him the greatness he has got i hourly learn a doctrine of obedience and would gladly look him i' th' face quick quick good hands what of death too that rids our dogs of languish where art thou death come hither come come come and take a queen worth many babes and beggars sir i will eat no meat i'll not drink sir if idle talk will once be necessary  i'll not sleep neither this mortal house i'll ruin do caesar what he can know sir that i will not wait pinioned at your master's court nor once be chastised with the sober eye of dull octavia shall they hoist me up and show me to the shouting varletry of censuring rome rather a ditch in egypt be gentle grave unto me rather on nilus' mud lay me stark naked and let the waterflies blow me into abhorring rather make my country's high pyramides my gibbet and hang me up in chains say i would die i cannot tell no matter sir what i have heard or known you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams is 't not your trick i dreamt there was an emperor antony o such another sleep that i might see but such another man his face was as the heavens and therein stuck a sun and moon which kept their course and lighted the little o the earth his legs bestrid the ocean his reared arm crested the world his voice was propertied as all the tun\u00e8d spheres and that to friends but when he meant to quail and shake the orb he was as rattling thunder for his bounty there was no winter in 't an autumn 'twas that grew the more by reaping his delights were dolphin like they showed his back above the element they lived in in his livery walked crowns and crownets realms and islands were as plates dropped from his pocket think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamt of you lie up to the hearing of the gods but if there be nor ever were one such it's past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy yet t' imagine an antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy condemning shadows quite i thank you sir know you what caesar means to do with me nay pray you sir he'll lead me then in triumph sir the gods will have it thus my master and my lord i must obey sole sir o' th' world i cannot project mine own cause so well to make it clear but do confess i have been laden with like frailties which before have often shamed our sex and may through all the world 'tis yours and we your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall hang in what place you please here my good lord this is the brief of money plate and jewels i am possessed of 'tis exactly valued not petty things admitted where's seleucus this is my treasurer let him speak my lord upon his peril that i have reserved to myself nothing speak the truth seleucus what have i kept back see caesar o behold how pomp is followed mine will now be yours and should we shift estates yours would be mine the ingratitude of this seleucus does even make me wild o slave of no more trust than love that's hired what goest thou back thou shalt go back i warrant thee but i'll catch thine eyes though they had wings slave soulless villain dog o rarely base o caesar what a wounding shame is this that thou vouchsafing here to visit me doing the honor of thy lordliness to one so meek that mine own servant should parcel the sum of my disgraces by addition of his envy say good caesar that i some lady trifles have reserved immoment toys things of such dignity as we greet modern friends withal and say some nobler token i have kept apart for livia and octavia to induce their mediation must i be unfolded with one that i have bred the gods it smites me beneath the fall i have prithee go hence or i shall show the cinders of my spirits through th' ashes of my chance wert thou a man thou wouldst have mercy on me be it known that we the greatest are misthought for things that others do and when we fall we answer others' merits in our name  are therefore to be pitied my master and my lord he words me girls he words me that i should not be noble to myself but hark thee charmian hie thee again i have spoke already and it is provided go put it to the haste dolabella dolabella i shall remain your debtor farewell and thanks now iras what think'st thou thou an egyptian puppet shall be shown in rome as well as i mechanic slaves with greasy aprons rules and hammers shall uplift us to the view in their thick breaths rank of gross diet shall we be enclouded and forced to drink their vapor nay 'tis most certain iras saucy lictors will catch at us like strumpets and scald rhymers ballad us out o' tune the quick comedians extemporally will stage us and present our alexandrian revels antony shall be brought drunken forth and i shall see some squeaking cleopatra boy my greatness i' th' posture of a whore nay that's certain why that's the way to fool their preparation and to conquer their most absurd intents now charmian show me my women like a queen go fetch my best attires i am again for cydnus to meet mark antony sirrah iras go  now noble charmian we'll dispatch indeed and when thou hast done this chare i'll give thee leave to play till doomsday bring our

hence farewell farewell ay ay farewell take thou no care it shall be heeded will it eat me well get thee gone farewell give me my robe put on my crown i have immortal longings in me now no more the juice of egypt's grape shall moist this lip yare yare good iras quick methinks i hear antony call i see him rouse himself to praise my noble act i hear him mock the luck of caesar which the gods give men to excuse their after wrath husband i come now to that name my courage prove my title i am fire and air my other elements i give to baser life so have you done come then and take the last warmth of my lips farewell kind charmian iras long farewell have i the aspic in my lips dost fall if thou and nature can so gently part the stroke of death is as a lover's pinch which hurts and is desired

which is my heaven to have come thou mortal wretch with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate of life at once untie poor venomous fool be angry and dispatch o couldst thou speak that i might hear thee call great caesar ass unpolicied peace peace dost thou not see my baby at my breast that sucks the nurse asleep as sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle  o antony nay i will take thee too what

brings home full numbers i find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young florentine called claudio he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it did he break out into tears a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces truer than those that are so washed how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping what is he that you ask for niece faith niece you tax signior benedick too much but he'll be meet with you i doubt it not you must not sir mistake my niece there is a kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them you will never run mad niece never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave her mother hath many times told me so signior benedick no for then were you a child if you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to the prince your brother i owe you all duty please it your grace lead on how now brother where is my cousin your son hath he provided this music are they good hath the fellow any wit that told you this no no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but i will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true go you and tell her of it cousins you know what you have to do o i cry you mercy friend go you with me and i will use your skill good cousin have a care this busy time was not count john here at supper then half signior benedick's tongue in count john's mouth and half count john's melancholy in signior benedick's face  by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue so by being too curst god will send you no horns you may light on a husband that hath no beard well then go you into hell well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband daughter

daughter and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match and all grace say amen to it niece will you look to those things i told you of there's little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit o lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad not till monday my dear son which is hence a just sevennight and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights' watchings no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it what effects my lord she will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how i would have sworn it had my lord especially against benedick no and swears she never will that's her torment this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for she'll be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her i measure him says she by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometimes afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian were it good think you if he do fear god he must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling nay that's impossible she may wear her heart out first my lord will you walk dinner is ready so say i methinks you are sadder where is but a humor or a worm indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard what would you with me honest neighbor brief i pray you for you see it is a busy time with me what is it my good friends neighbors you are tedious all thy tediousness on me ah i would fain know what you have to say indeed neighbor he comes too short of you i must leave you take their examination yourself and bring it me i am now in great haste as it may appear unto you drink some wine ere you go fare you well i'll wait upon them i am ready come friar francis be brief only to the plain form of marriage and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards to be married to her friar you come to marry her i dare make his answer none as freely son as god did give her me what do you mean my lord dear my lord if you in your own proof have vanquished the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity  sweet prince why speak not you are these things spoken or do i but dream all this is so but what of this my lord i charge thee do so as thou art my child hath no man's dagger here a point for me o fate take not away thy heavy hand death is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wished for dost thou look up wherefore why doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her could she here deny the story that is printed in her blood  do not live hero do not ope thine eyes for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rearward of reproaches strike at thy life grieved i i had but one chid i for that at frugal nature's frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggar's issue at my gates who smirch\u00e8d thus and mired with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised and mine that i was proud on mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of her why she o she is fall'n into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foul tainted flesh confirmed confirmed o that is stronger made which was before barred up with ribs of iron would the two princes lie and claudio lie who loved her so that speaking of her foulness washed it with tears hence from her let her die friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness i know not if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honor the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awaked in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly what shall become of this what will this do being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me i pray thee cease thy counsel which falls into mine ears as profitless as water in a sieve give not me counsel nor let no comforter delight mine ear but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine bring me a father that so loved his child whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine and bid him speak of patience measure his woe the length and breadth of mine and let it answer every strain for strain as thus for thus and such a grief for such in every lineament branch shape and form if such a one will smile and stroke his beard bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk with candle wasters bring him yet to me and i of him will gather patience but there is no such man for brother men can counsel and speak comfort to that grief which they themselves not feel but tasting it their counsel turns to passion which before would give preceptial med'cine to rage fetter strong madness in a silken thread charm ache with air and agony with words no no 'tis all men's office to speak patience to those that wring under the load of sorrow but no man's virtue nor sufficiency to be so moral when he shall endure the like himself therefore give me no counsel my griefs cry louder than advertisement i pray thee peace i will be flesh and blood for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently however they have writ the style of gods and made a push at chance and sufferance there thou speak'st reason nay i will do so my soul doth tell me hero is belied and that shall claudio know so shall the prince and all of them that thus dishonor her hear you my lords  some haste my lord well fare you well my lord are you so hasty now well all is one marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword i fear thee not tush tush man never fleer and jest at me i speak not like a dotard nor a fool as under privilege of age to brag what i have done being young or what would do were i not old know claudio to thy head thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me that i am forced to lay my reverence by and with gray hairs and bruise of many days do challenge thee to trial of a man i say thou hast belied mine innocent child thy slander hath gone through and through her heart and she lies buried with her ancestors o in a tomb where never scandal slept save this of hers framed by thy villainy thine claudio thine i say my lord my lord i'll prove it on his body if he dare despite his nice fence and his active practice

spirit melancholy had baked thy blood and made it heavy thick which else runs tickling up and down the veins making that idiot laughter keep men's eyes and strain their cheeks to idle merriment a passion hateful to my purposes or if that thou couldst see me without eyes hear me without thine ears and make reply without a tongue using conceit alone without eyes ears and harmful sound of words then in despite of brooded watchful day i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts but ah i will not yet i love thee well and by my troth i think thou lov'st me well do not i know thou wouldst good hubert hubert hubert throw thine eye on yon young boy i'll tell thee what my friend he is a very serpent in my way and wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread he lies before me dost thou understand me thou art his keeper death a grave enough i could be merry now hubert i love thee well i'll not say what i intend for thee remember madam fare you well i'll send those powers o'er to your majesty for england cousin go hubert shall be your man attend on you with all true duty on toward calais ho here once again we sit once again crowned and looked upon i hope with cheerful eyes some reasons of this double coronation i have possessed you with and think them strong and more more strong when lesser is my fear i shall endue you with meantime but ask what you would have reformed that is not well and well shall you perceive how willingly i will both hear and grant you your requests let it be so i do commit his youth to your direction hubert what news with you we cannot hold mortality's strong hand  good lords although my will to give is living the suit which you demand is gone and dead he tells us arthur is deceased tonight why do you bend such solemn brows on me think you i bear the shears of destiny have i commandment on the pulse of life they burn in indignation i repent there is no sure foundation set on blood no certain life achieved by others' death a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks so foul a sky clears not without a storm pour down thy weather how goes all in france o where hath our intelligence been drunk where hath it slept where is my mother's care that such an army could be drawn in france and she not hear of it withhold thy speed dreadful occasion o make a league with me till i have pleased my discontented peers what mother dead how wildly then walks my estate in france  under whose conduct came those powers of france that thou for truth giv'st out are landed here thou hast made me giddy with these ill tidings now what says the world to your proceedings do not seek to stuff my head with more ill news for it is full bear with me cousin for i was amazed under the tide but now i breathe again aloft the flood and can give audience to any tongue speak it of what it will thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so hubert away with him imprison him and on that day at noon whereon he says i shall yield up my crown let him be hanged deliver him to safety and return for i must use thee o my gentle cousin hear'st thou the news abroad who are arrived gentle kinsman go and thrust thyself into their companies i have a way to win their loves again bring them before me nay but make haste the better foot before o let me have no subject enemies when adverse foreigners affright my towns with dreadful pomp of stout invasion be mercury set feathers to thy heels and fly like thought from them to me again spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman go after him for he perhaps shall need some messenger betwixt me and the peers and be thou he my mother dead five moons why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears why urgest thou so oft young arthur's death thy hand hath murdered him i had a mighty cause to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him it is the curse of kings to be attended by slaves that take their humors for a warrant to break within the bloody house of life and on the winking of authority to understand a law to know the meaning of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns more upon humor than advised respect o when the last accompt twixt heaven and earth is to be made then shall this hand and seal witness against us to damnation how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by a fellow by the hand of nature marked quoted and signed to do a deed of shame this murder had not come into my mind but taking note of thy abhorred aspect finding thee fit for bloody villainy apt liable to be employed in danger i faintly broke with thee of arthur's death and thou to be endear\u00e8d to a king made it no conscience to destroy a prince hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause when i spake darkly what i purpos\u00e8d or turned an eye of doubt upon my face as bid me tell my tale in express words deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me but thou didst understand me by my signs and didst in signs again parley with sin yea without stop didst let thy heart consent and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed which both our tongues held vile to name out of my sight and never see me more my nobles leave me and my state is braved even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers nay in the body of this fleshly land this kingdom this confine of blood and breath hostility and civil tumult reigns between my conscience and my cousin's death doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers throw this report on their incens\u00e8d rage and make them tame to their obedience forgive the comment that my passion made upon thy feature for my rage was blind and foul imaginary eyes of blood presented thee more hideous than thou art o answer not but to my closet bring the angry lords with all expedient haste i conjure thee but slowly run more fast thus have i yielded up into your hand the circle of my glory now keep your holy word go meet the french and from his holiness use all your power to stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed our discontented counties do revolt our people quarrel with obedience swearing allegiance and the love of soul to stranger blood to foreign royalty this inundation of mistempered humor rests by you only to be qualified then pause not for the present time's so sick that present med'cine must be ministered or overthrow incurable ensues is this ascension day did not the prophet say that before ascension day at noon my crown i should give off even so i have i did suppose it should be on constraint but god be thanked it is but voluntary would not my lords return to me again after they heard young arthur was alive that villain hubert told me he did live the legate of the pope hath been with me and i have made a happy peace with him and he hath promised to dismiss the powers led by the dauphin have thou the ordering of this present time how goes the day with us o tell me hubert this fever that hath troubled me so long lies heavy on me o my heart is sick tell him toward swinstead to the abbey there ay me this tyrant fever burns me up and will not let me welcome this good news set on toward swinstead to my litter straight weakness possesseth me and i am faint ay marry now my soul hath elbow room it would not out at windows nor at doors there is so hot a summer in my bosom that all my bowels crumble up to dust i am a scribbled form drawn with a pen upon a parchment and against this fire do i shrink up poisoned ill fare dead forsook cast off and none of you will bid the winter come to thrust his icy fingers in my maw nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course through my burned bosom nor entreat the north to make his bleak winds kiss my parch\u00e8d lips and comfort me with cold i do not ask you much i beg cold comfort and you are so strait and so ingrateful you deny me that the salt in them is hot within me is a hell and there the poison is as a fiend confined to tyrannize on unreprievable condemn\u00e8d blood o cousin thou art come to set mine eye the tackle of my heart is cracked and burnt and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail are turn\u00e8d to one thread one little hair

fortune honest nurse farewell good even to my ghostly confessor as much to him else is his thanks too much conceit more rich in matter than in words brags of his substance not of ornament they are but beggars that can count their worth but my true love is grown to such excess i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth gallop apace you fiery footed steeds towards phoebus' lodging such a wagoner as pha\u00ebton would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately spread thy close curtain love performing night that runaways' eyes may wink and romeo leap to these arms untalked of and unseen lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties or if love be blind it best agrees with night come civil night thou sober suited matron all in black and learn me how to lose a winning match played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks with thy black mantle till strange love grow bold think true love acted simple modesty come night

die take him and cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun o i have bought the mansion of a love but not possessed it and though i am sold not yet enjoyed so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them o here comes my nurse and she brings news and every tongue that speaks but romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence  now nurse what news what hast thou there the cords that romeo bid thee fetch ay me what news why dost thou wring thy hands can heaven be so envious what devil art thou that dost torment me thus this torture should be roared in dismal hell hath romeo slain himself say thou but ay and that bare vowel i shall poison more than the death darting eye of cockatrice i am not i if there be such an i or those eyes shut that makes thee answer ay if he be slain say ay or if not no brief sounds

fiend in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound o that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace blistered be thy tongue for such a wish he was not born to shame upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit for 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned sole monarch of the universal earth o what a beast was i to chide at him shall i speak ill of him that is my husband ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name when i thy three hours wife have mangled it but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin that villain cousin would have killed my husband back foolish tears back to your native spring your tributary drops belong to woe which you mistaking offer up to joy my husband lives that tybalt would have slain and tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband all this is comfort wherefore weep i then some word there was worser than tybalt's death that murdered me i would forget it fain but o it presses to my memory like damn\u00e8d guilty deeds to sinners' minds tybalt is dead and romeo banish\u00e8d that banish\u00e8d that one word banish\u00e8d hath slain ten thousand tybalts tybalt's death was woe enough if it had ended there or if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be ranked with other griefs why followed not when she said tybalt's dead thy father or thy mother nay or both which modern lamentation might have moved but with a rearward following tybalt's death romeo is banish\u00e8d to speak that word is father mother tybalt romeo juliet all slain all dead romeo is banish\u00e8d there is no end no limit measure bound in that word's death no words can that woe sound where is my father and my mother nurse wash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spent when theirs are dry for romeo's

wedding bed and death not romeo take my maidenhead o find him give this ring to my true knight and bid him come to take his last farewell wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree believe me love it was the nightingale yond light is not daylight i know it i it is some meteor that the sun exhaled to be to thee this night a torchbearer and light thee on thy way to mantua therefore stay yet thou need'st not to be gone it is it is hie hence begone away it is the

ere i again behold my romeo o think'st thou we shall ever meet again o god i have an ill divining soul methinks i see thee now thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale o fortune fortune all men call thee fickle if thou art fickle what dost thou with him that is renowned for faith be fickle fortune for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long but send him back who is 't that calls it is my lady mother is she not down so late or up so early what unaccustomed cause procures her hither madam i am not well yet let me weep for such a feeling loss feeling so the loss i cannot choose but ever weep the friend what villain madam villain and he be many miles asunder  god pardon him i do with all my heart and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart ay madam from the reach of these my hands would none but i might venge my cousin's death indeed i never shall be satisfied with romeo till i behold him dead  is my poor heart so for a kinsman vexed madam if you could find out but a man to bear a poison i would temper it that romeo should upon receipt thereof soon sleep in quiet o how my heart abhors to hear him named and cannot come to him to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that hath slaughtered him and joy comes well in such a needy time what are they beseech your ladyship madam in happy time what day is that now by saint peter's church and peter too he shall not make me there a joyful bride i wonder at this haste that i must wed ere he that should be husband comes to woo i pray you tell my lord and father madam i will not marry yet and when i do i swear it shall be romeo whom you know i hate rather than paris these are news indeed not proud you have but thankful that you have proud can i never be of what i hate but thankful even for hate that is meant love good father i beseech you on my knees hear me with patience but to speak a word is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief  o sweet my mother cast me not away delay this marriage for a month a week or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies o god o nurse how shall this be prevented my husband is on earth my faith in heaven how shall that faith return again to earth unless that husband send it me from heaven by leaving earth comfort me counsel me  alack alack that heaven should practice stratagems upon so soft a subject as myself  what sayst thou hast thou not a word of joy some comfort nurse speak'st thou from thy heart amen well thou hast comforted me marvelous much go in and tell my lady i am gone having displeased my father to lawrence' cell to make confession and to be absolved ancient damnation o most wicked fiend is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue which she hath praised him with above compare so many thousand times go counselor thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain i'll to the friar to know his remedy if all else fail myself have power to die that may be sir when i may be a wife what must be shall be to answer that i should confess to you i will confess to you that i love him if i do so it will be of more price being spoke behind your back than to your face the tears have got small victory by that for it was bad enough before their spite that is no slander sir which is a truth and what i spake i spake it to my face it may be so for it is not mine own  are you at leisure holy father now or shall i come to you at evening mass o shut the door and when thou hast done so come weep with me past hope past care past help tell me not friar that thou hearest of this unless thou tell me how i may prevent it if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise and with this knife i'll help it presently god joined my heart and romeo's thou our hands and ere this hand by thee to romeo's sealed shall be the label to another deed or my true heart with treacherous revolt turn to another this shall slay them both therefore out of thy long experienced time give me some present counsel or behold 'twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the umpire arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honor bring be not so long to speak i long to die if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy o bid me leap rather than marry paris from off the battlements of any tower or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk where serpents are chain me with roaring bears or hide me nightly in a charnel house o'ercovered quite with dead men's rattling bones with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls or bid me go into a new made grave and hide me with a dead man in his shroud things that to hear them told have made me tremble and i will do it without fear or doubt to live an unstained wife to my sweet love give me give me o tell not me of fear love give me strength and strength shall help afford farewell dear father where i have learned me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you and your behests and am enjoined by holy lawrence to fall prostrate here to beg your pardon pardon i beseech you henceforward i am ever ruled by you i met the youthful lord at lawrence' cell and gave him what becom\u00e8d love i might not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty nurse will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ay those attires are best but gentle nurse i pray thee leave me to myself tonight for i have need of many orisons to move the heavens to smile upon my state which well thou knowest is cross and full of sin no madam we have culled such necessaries as are behooveful for our state tomorrow so please you let me now be left alone and let the nurse this night sit up with you for i am sure you have your hands full all in this so sudden business farewell god knows when we shall meet again i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins that almost freezes up the heat of life i'll call them back again to comfort me  nurse what should she do here my dismal scene i needs must act alone come vial what if this mixture do not work at all shall i be married then tomorrow morning no no this shall forbid it lie thou there what if it be a poison which the friar subtly hath ministered to have me dead lest in this marriage he should be dishonored because he married me before to romeo i fear it is and yet methinks it should not for he hath still been tried a holy man how if when i am laid into the tomb i wake before the time that romeo come to redeem me there's a fearful point shall i not then be stifled in the vault to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in and there die strangled ere my romeo comes or if i live is it not very like the horrible conceit of death and night together with the terror of the place  as in a vault an ancient receptacle where for this many hundred years the bones of all my buried ancestors are packed where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth lies fest'ring in his shroud where as they say at some hours in the night spirits resort  alack alack is it not like that i so early waking what with loathsome smells and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth that living mortals hearing them run mad  o if i wake shall i not be distraught environ\u00e8d with all these hideous fears and madly play with my forefathers' joints and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud and in this rage with some great kinsman's bone as with a club dash out my desp'rate brains o look methinks i see my cousin's ghost seeking out romeo that did spit his body upon a rapier's point stay tybalt stay romeo romeo romeo here's drink i drink to thee o comfortable friar where is my lord i do remember well where i should be and there i am where is my romeo go get thee hence for i will not away what's here a cup closed in my true love's hand poison i see hath been his timeless end  o churl drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after i will kiss thy lips haply some poison yet doth hang on them to make me die with a restorative thy lips are warm yea

may be rotten o duke theseus the goodly mothers that have groaned for these and all the longing maids that ever loved if your vow stand shall curse me and my beauty and in their funeral songs for these two cousins despise my cruelty and cry woe worth me till i am nothing but the scorn of women for heaven's sake save their lives and banish 'em swear 'em never more to make me their contention or to know me to tread upon thy dukedom and to be wherever they shall travel ever strangers to one another i cannot sir they are both too excellent for me a hair shall never fall of these men yes i must sir else both miscarry yet i may bind those wounds up that must open and bleed to death for my sake else i'll choose and end their strife two such young handsome men shall never fall for me their weeping mothers following the dead cold ashes of their sons shall never curse my cruelty good heaven what a sweet face has arcite if wise nature with all her best endowments all those beauties she sows into the births of noble bodies were here a mortal woman and had in her the coy denials of young maids yet doubtless she would run mad for this man what an eye of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness has this young prince here love himself sits smiling just such another wanton ganymede set jove afire with and enforced the god snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him a shining constellation what a brow of what a spacious majesty he carries arched like the great eyed juno's but far sweeter smoother than pelops' shoulder fame and honor methinks from hence as from a promontory pointed in heaven should clap their wings and sing to all the under world the loves and fights of gods and such men near 'em palamon is but his foil to him a mere dull shadow he's swart and meager of an eye as heavy as if he had lost his mother a still temper no stirring in him no alacrity of all this sprightly sharpness not a smile yet these that we count errors may become him narcissus was a sad boy but a heavenly o who can find the bent of woman's fancy i am a fool my reason is lost in me i have no choice and i have lied so lewdly that women ought to beat me on my knees i ask thy pardon palamon thou art alone and only beautiful and these the eyes these the bright lamps of beauty that command and threaten love and what young maid dare cross 'em what a bold gravity and yet inviting has this brown manly face o love this only from this hour is complexion lie there arcite thou art a changeling to him a mere gypsy and this the noble body i am sotted utterly lost my virgin's faith has fled me for if my brother but even now had asked me whether i loved i had run mad for arcite now if my sister more for palamon stand both together now come ask me brother alas i know not ask me now sweet sister i may go look what a mere child is fancy that having two fair gauds of equal sweetness cannot distinguish but must cry for both how now sir to end the quarrel would i might end first what sins have i committed chaste diana that my unspotted youth must now be soiled with blood of princes and my chastity be made the altar where the lives of lovers  two greater and two better never yet made mothers joy must be the sacrifice to my unhappy beauty i had rather both so neither for my sake should fall untimely must these men die too poor wench go weep for whosoever wins loses a noble cousin for thy sins o sacred shadowy cold and constant queen abandoner of revels mute contemplative sweet solitary white as chaste and pure as wind fanned snow who to thy female knights allow'st no more blood than will make a blush which is their order's robe i here thy priest am humbled 'fore thine altar o vouchsafe with that thy rare green eye which never yet beheld thing maculate look on thy virgin and sacred silver mistress lend thine ear  which ne'er heard scurrile term into whose port ne'er entered wanton sound to my petition seasoned with holy fear this is my last of vestal office i am bride habited but maiden hearted a husband i have 'pointed but do not know him out of two i should choose one and pray for his success but i am guiltless of election of mine eyes were i to lose one they are equal precious  i could doom neither that which perished should go to 't unsentenced therefore most modest queen he of the two pretenders that best loves me and has the truest title in 't let him take off my wheaten garland or else grant the file and quality i hold i may continue in thy band see what our general of ebbs and flows out from the bowels of her holy altar with sacred act advances but one rose if well inspired this battle shall confound both these brave knights and i a virgin flower must grow alone unplucked the flower is fall'n the tree descends o mistress thou here dischargest me i shall be gathered i think so but i know not thine own will unclasp thy mystery i hope she's pleased her signs were gracious i'll no step further i had rather see a wren hawk at a fly than this decision ev'ry blow that falls threats a brave life each stroke laments the place whereon it falls and sounds more like a bell than blade i will stay here it is enough my hearing shall be punished with what shall happen 'gainst the which there is no deafing but to hear not taint mine eye with dread sights it may shun pardon me if i were there i'd wink i am extinct there is but envy in that light which shows the one the other darkness which ever was the dam of horror who does stand accursed of many mortal millions may even now by casting her black mantle over both that neither could find other get herself some part of a good name and many a murder set off whereto she's guilty in faith i will not sir pardon me the title of a kingdom may be tried out of itself arcite is gently visaged yet his eye is like an engine bent or a sharp weapon in a soft sheath mercy and manly courage are bedfellows in his visage palamon has a most menacing aspect his brow is graved and seems to bury what it frowns on yet sometimes 'tis not so but alters to the quality of his thoughts long time his eye will dwell upon his object melancholy becomes him nobly so does arcite's mirth but palamon's sadness is a kind of mirth so mingled as if mirth did make him sad and sadness merry those darker humors that stick misbecomingly on others on them live in fair dwelling hark how yon spurs to spirit do incite the princes to their proof arcite may win me and yet may palamon wound arcite to the spoiling of his figure o what pity enough for such a chance if i were by i might do hurt for they would glance their eyes towards my seat and in that motion might omit a ward or forfeit an offense which craved that very time it is much better i am not there o better never born than minister to such harm what is the chance then he has won 'twas ever likely he looked all grace and success and he is doubtless the prim'st of men i prithee run and tell me how it goes run and inquire poor servant thou hast lost upon my right side still i wore thy picture palamon's on the left why so i know not i had no end in 't else chance would have it so on the sinister side the heart lies palamon had the best boding chance this burst of clamor is sure th' end o' th' combat were they metamorphosed both into one o why there were no woman worth so composed a man their single share their nobleness peculiar to them gives the prejudice of disparity value's shortness to any lady breathing more exulting palamon still i prithee lay attention to the cry set both thine ears to th' business half sights saw that arcite was no babe god's lid his richness and costliness of spirit looked through him it could no more be hid in him than fire in flax than humble banks can go to law with waters that drift winds force to raging i did think good palamon would miscarry yet i knew not why i did think so our reasons are not prophets when oft our fancies are they are coming off alas poor palamon is this winning o all you heavenly powers where is your mercy but that your wills have said it must be so and charge me live to comfort this unfriended this miserable prince that cuts away a life more worthy from him than all women i should and would die too i'll close thine eyes prince blessed souls be with thee thou art a right good man and while i live this day i give to tears", "Cym_Belarius": "a

the world may read in me my body's marked with roman swords and my report was once first with the best of note cymbeline loved me and when a soldier was the theme my name was not far off then was i as a tree whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night a storm or robbery call it what you will shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves and left me bare to weather my fault being nothing as i have told you oft but that two villains whose false oaths prevailed before my perfect honor swore to cymbeline i was confederate with the romans so followed my banishment and this twenty years this rock and these demesnes have been my world where i have lived at honest freedom paid more pious debts to heaven than in all the fore end of my time but up to th' mountains this is not hunters' language he that strikes the venison first shall be the lord o' th' feast to him the other two shall minister and we will fear no poison which attends in place of greater state i'll meet you in the

i' th' cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hit the roofs of palaces and nature prompts them in simple and low things to prince it much beyond the trick of others this polydor the heir of cymbeline and britain who the king his father called guiderius jove when on my three foot stool i sit and tell the warlike feats i have done his spirits fly out into my story say thus mine enemy fell and thus i set my foot on 's neck even then the princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture that acts my words the younger brother cadwal once arviragus in as like a figure strikes life into my speech and shows much more his own conceiving hark the game is roused o cymbeline heaven and my conscience knows thou didst unjustly banish me whereon at three and two years old i stole these babes thinking to bar thee of succession as thou refts me of my lands euriphile thou wast their nurse they took thee for their mother and every day do honor to her grave

is heavy fasting when we have supped we'll mannerly demand thee of thy story so far as thou wilt speak it you are not well remain here in the cave we'll come to you after hunting what how how o noble

howe'er distressed appears he hath had good ancestors it is great morning come away who's there those runagates means he not us i partly know him 'tis cloten the son o' th' queen i fear some ambush i saw him not these many years and yet i know 'tis he we are held as outlaws hence no company's abroad i cannot tell long is it since i saw him but time hath nothing blurred those lines of favor which then he wore the snatches in his voice and burst of speaking were as his i am absolute 'twas very cloten being scarce made up i mean to man he had not apprehension of roaring terrors for defect of judgment is oft the cause of fear but see thy brother what hast thou done we are all undone no single soul can we set eye on but in all safe reason he must have some attendants though his humor was nothing but mutation ay and that from one bad thing to worse not frenzy not absolute madness could so far have raved to bring him here alone although perhaps it may be heard at court that such as we cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time may make some stronger head the which he hearing  as it is like him might break out and swear he'd fetch us in yet is 't not probable to come alone either he so undertaking or they so suffering then on good ground we fear if we do fear this body hath a tail more perilous than the head i had no mind to hunt this day the boy fidele's sickness did make my way long forth i fear 'twill be revenged would polydor thou hadst not done 't though valor becomes thee well enough well 'tis done we'll hunt no more today nor seek for danger where there's no profit i prithee to our rock you and fidele play the cooks i'll stay till hasty polydor return and bring him to dinner presently o thou goddess thou divine nature thou thyself thou blazon'st in these two princely boys they are as gentle as zephyrs blowing below the violet not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough their royal blood enchafed as the rud'st wind that by the top doth take the mountain pine and make him stoop to th' vale 'tis wonder that an invisible instinct should frame them to royalty unlearned honor untaught civility not seen from other valor that wildly grows in them but yields a crop as if it had been sowed yet still it's strange what cloten's being here to us portends or what his death will bring us my ingenious instrument hark polydor it sounds but what occasion hath cadwal now to give it motion hark he went hence even now look here he comes and brings the dire occasion in his arms of what we blame him for o melancholy whoever yet could sound thy bottom find the ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare might eas'liest harbor in thou bless\u00e8d thing jove knows what man thou mightst have made but i thou died'st a most rare boy of melancholy  how found you him great griefs i see med'cine the less for cloten is quite forgot he was a queen's son boys and though he came our enemy remember he was paid for that though mean and mighty rotting together have one dust yet reverence that angel of the world doth make distinction of place 'tween high and low our foe was princely and though you took his life as being our foe yet bury him as a prince here's a

which we upon you strew  come on away apart upon our knees the ground that gave them first has them again their pleasures here are past so is their pain let us from it sons we'll higher to the mountains there secure us to the king's party there's no going newness of cloten's death we being not known not mustered among the bands may drive us to a render where we have lived and so extort from 's that which we have done whose answer would be death drawn on with torture o i am known of many in the army many years though cloten then but young you see not wore him from my remembrance and besides the king hath not deserved my service nor your loves who find in my exile the want of breeding the certainty of this hard life aye hopeless to have the courtesy your cradle promised but to be still hot summer's tanlings and the shrinking slaves of winter no reason i since of your lives you set so slight a valuation should reserve my cracked one to more care have with you boys if in your country wars you chance to die that is my bed too lads and there i'll lie lead lead the time seems long their blood thinks scorn till it fly out and show them princes born stand stand we have th' advantage of the ground the lane is guarded nothing routs us but the villainy of our fears i never saw such noble fury in so poor a thing such precious deeds in one that promised naught but beggary and poor looks sir in cambria are we born and gentlemen further to boast were neither true nor modest unless i add we are honest is not this boy revived from death peace peace see further he eyes us not forbear creatures may be alike were 't he i am sure he would have spoke to us be silent let's see further my boys there was our error though you did love this youth i blame you not you had a motive for 't stay sir king this man is better than the man he slew as well descended as thyself and hath more of thee merited than a band of clotens had ever scar for let his arms alone they were not born for bondage we will die all three but i will prove that two on 's are as good as i have given out him my sons i must for mine own part unfold a dangerous speech though haply well for you have at it then by leave thou hadst great king a subject who was called belarius he it is that hath assumed this age indeed a banished man i know not how a traitor not too hot first pay me for the nursing of thy sons and let it be confiscate all so soon as i have received it i am too blunt and saucy here's my knee ere i arise i will prefer my sons then spare not the old father mighty sir these two young gentlemen that call me father and think they are my sons are none of mine they are the issue of your loins my liege and blood of your begetting so sure as you your father's i old morgan am that belarius whom you sometime banished your pleasure was my mere offense my punishment itself and all my treason that i suffered was all the harm i did these gentle princes  for such and so they are these twenty years have i trained up those arts they have as i could put into them my breeding was sir as your highness knows their nurse euriphile whom for the theft i wedded stole these children upon my banishment i moved her to 't having received the punishment before for that which i did then beaten for loyalty excited me to treason their dear loss the more of you 'twas felt the more it shaped unto my end of stealing them but gracious sir here are your sons again and i must lose two of the sweet'st companions in the world the benediction of these covering heavens fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy to inlay heaven with stars be pleased awhile this gentleman whom i call polydor most worthy prince as yours is true guiderius this gentleman my cadwal arviragus your younger princely son he sir was lapped in a most curious mantle wrought by th' hand of his queen mother which for more probation i can with ease produce this is he who hath upon him still that natural stamp it was wise nature's end in the donation to be his evidence now", "H5_HenryV": "where is my gracious lord of canterbury send for him good uncle not yet my cousin we would be resolved before we hear him of some things of weight that task our thoughts concerning us and france sure we thank you my learn\u00e8d lord we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salic that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate whose right suits not in native colors with the truth for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to therefore take heed how you impawn our person how you awake our sleeping sword of war we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint 'gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords that makes such waste in brief mortality under this conjuration speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience washed as pure as sin with baptism may i with right and conscience make this claim we must not only arm t' invade the french but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot who will make road upon us with all advantages we do not mean the coursing snatchers only but fear the main intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us for you shall read that my great grandfather never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnished kingdom came pouring like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fullness of his force galling the glean\u00e8d land with hot assays girding with grievous siege castles and towns that england being empty of defense hath shook and trembled at th' ill neighborhood call in the messengers sent from the dauphin now are we well resolved and by god's help and yours the noble sinews of our power france being ours we'll bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces or there we'll sit ruling in large and ample empery o'er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms or lay these bones in an unworthy urn tombless with no remembrance over them either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts or else our grave like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth not worshiped with a waxen epitaph now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear your greeting is from him not from the king we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as is our wretches fettered in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurb\u00e8d plainness tell us the dauphin's mind what treasure uncle we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us his present and your pains we thank you for when we have matched our rackets to these balls we will in france by god's grace play a set shall strike his father's crown into the hazard tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturbed with chases and we understand him well how he comes o'er us with our wilder days not measuring what use we made of them we never valued this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous license as 'tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home but tell the dauphin i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france for that i have laid by my majesty and plodded like a man for working days but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turned his balls to gun stones and his soul shall stand sore charg\u00e8d for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands mock mothers from their sons mock castles down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphin's scorn but this lies all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a well hallowed cause so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savor but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it  convey them with safe conduct fare you well we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furth'rance to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business therefore let our proportions for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings for god before we'll chide this dauphin at his father's door therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought now sits the wind fair and we will aboard  my lord of cambridge and my kind lord of masham and you my gentle knight give me your thoughts think you not that the powers we bear with us will cut their passage through the force of france doing the execution and the act for which we have in head assembled them i doubt not that since we are well persuaded we carry not a heart with us from hence that grows not in a fair consent with ours nor leave not one behind that doth not wish success and conquest to attend on us we therefore have great cause of thankfulness and shall forget the office of our hand sooner than quittance of desert and merit according to the weight and worthiness we judge no less uncle of exeter enlarge the man committed yesterday that railed against our person we consider it was excess of wine that set him on and on his more advice we pardon him o let us yet be merciful alas your too much love and care of me are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch if little faults proceeding on distemper shall not be winked at how shall we stretch our eye when capital crimes chewed swallowed and digested appear before us we'll yet enlarge that man though cambridge scroop and grey in their dear care and tender preservation of our person would have him punished and now to our french causes who are the late commissioners then richard earl of cambridge there is yours  there yours lord scroop of masham and sir knight grey of northumberland this same is yours  read them and know i know your worthiness  my lord of westmoreland and uncle exeter we will aboard tonight why how now gentlemen what see you in those papers that you lose so much complexion look you how they change their cheeks are paper why what read you there that have so cowarded and chased your blood out of appearance the mercy that was quick in us but late by your own counsel is suppressed and killed you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy for your own reasons turn into your bosoms as dogs upon their masters worrying you  see you my princes and my noble peers these english monsters my lord of cambridge here you know how apt our love was to accord to furnish him with all appurtenants belonging to his honor and this man hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired and sworn unto the practices of france to kill us here in hampton to the which this knight no less for bounty bound to us than cambridge is hath likewise sworn but o what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel ingrateful savage and inhuman creature thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels that knew'st the very bottom of my soul that almost mightst have coined me into gold wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use  may it be possible that foreign hire could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger 'tis so strange that though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white my eye will scarcely see it treason and murder ever kept together as two yoke devils sworn to either's purpose working so grossly in a natural cause that admiration did not whoop at them but thou 'gainst all proportion didst bring in wonder to wait on treason and on murder and whatsoever cunning fiend it was that wrought upon thee so preposterously hath got the voice in hell for excellence all other devils that suggest by treasons do botch and bungle up damnation with patches colors and with forms being fetched from glist'ring semblances of piety but he that tempered thee bade thee stand up gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason unless to dub thee with the name of traitor if that same demon that hath gulled thee thus should with his lion gait walk the whole world he might return to vasty tartar back and tell the legions i can never win a soul so easy as that englishman's o how hast thou with jealousy infected the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful why so didst thou seem they grave and learn\u00e8d why so didst thou come they of noble family why so didst thou seem they religious why so didst thou or are they spare in diet free from gross passion or of mirth or anger constant in spirit not swerving with the blood garnished and decked in modest complement not working with the eye without the ear and but in purg\u00e8d judgment trusting neither such and so finely bolted didst thou seem and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot to mark the full fraught man and best endued with some suspicion i will weep for thee for this revolt of thine methinks is like another fall of man their faults are open arrest them to the answer of the law and god acquit them of their practices god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence you have conspired against our royal person joined with an enemy proclaimed and from his coffers received the golden earnest of our death wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter his princes and his peers to servitude his subjects to oppression and contempt and his whole kingdom into desolation touching our person seek we no revenge but we our kingdom's safety must so tender whose ruin you have sought that to her laws we do deliver you get you therefore hence poor miserable wretches to your death the taste whereof god of his mercy give you patience to endure and true repentance of all your dear offenses bear them hence now lords for france the enterprise whereof shall be to you as us like glorious we doubt not of a fair and lucky war since god so graciously hath brought to light this dangerous treason lurking in our way to hinder our beginnings we doubt not now but every rub is smooth\u00e8d on our way then forth dear countrymen let us deliver our puissance into the hand of god putting it straight in expedition cheerly to sea the signs of war advance no king of england if not king of france once more unto the breach dear friends once more or close the wall up with our english dead in peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility but when the blast of war blows in our ears then imitate the action of the tiger stiffen the sinews summon up the blood disguise fair nature with hard favored rage then lend the eye a terrible aspect let it pry through the portage of the head like the brass cannon let the brow o'erwhelm it as fearfully as doth a gall\u00e8d rock o'erhang and jutty his confounded base swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height on on you noblest english whose blood is fet from fathers of war proof fathers that like so many alexanders have in these parts from morn till even fought and sheathed their swords for lack of argument dishonor not your mothers now attest that those whom you called fathers did beget you be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war and you good yeomen whose limbs were made in england show us here the mettle of your pasture let us swear that you are worth your breeding which i doubt not for there is none of you so mean and base that hath not noble luster in your eyes i see you stand like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start the game's afoot follow your spirit and upon this charge cry god for harry england and saint george how yet resolves the governor of the town this is the latest parle we will admit therefore to our best mercy give yourselves or like to men proud of destruction defy us to our worst for as i am a soldier a name that in my thoughts becomes me best if i begin the batt'ry once again i will not leave the half achieved harfleur till in her ashes she lie buri\u00e8d the gates of mercy shall be all shut up and the fleshed soldier rough and hard of heart in liberty of bloody hand shall range with conscience wide as hell mowing like grass your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants what is it then to me if impious war arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends do with his smirched complexion all fell feats enlinked to waste and desolation what is 't to me when you yourselves are cause if your pure maidens fall into the hand of hot and forcing violation what rein can hold licentious wickedness when down the hill he holds his fierce career we may as bootless spend our vain command upon th' enrag\u00e8d soldiers in their spoil as send precepts to the leviathan to come ashore therefore you men of harfleur take pity of your town and of your people whiles yet my soldiers are in my command whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace o'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds of heady murder spoil and villainy if not why in a moment look to see the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand desire the locks of your shrill shrieking daughters your fathers taken by the silver beards and their most reverend heads dashed to the walls your naked infants spitted upon pikes whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry at herod's bloody hunting slaughtermen what say you will you yield and this avoid or guilty in defense be thus destroyed open your gates come uncle exeter go you and enter harfleur there remain and fortify it strongly 'gainst the french use mercy to them all for us dear uncle the winter coming on and sickness growing upon our soldiers we will retire to calais tonight in harfleur will we be your guest tomorrow for the march are we addressed how now fluellen cam'st thou from the bridge what men have you lost fluellen we would have all such offenders so cut off and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages nothing taken but paid for none of the french upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the gentler gamester is the soonest winner well then i know thee what shall i know of thee unfold it what is thy name i know thy quality thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back and tell thy king i do not seek him now but could be willing to march on to calais without impeachment for to say the sooth though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much unto an enemy of craft and vantage my people are with sickness much enfeebled my numbers lessened and those few i have almost no better than so many french who when they were in health i tell thee herald i thought upon one pair of english legs did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god that i do brag thus this your air of france hath blown that vice in me i must repent go therefore tell thy master here i am my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk my army but a weak and sickly guard yet god before tell him we will come on though france himself and such another neighbor stand in our way there's for thy labor montjoy go bid thy master well advise himself if we may pass we will if we be hindered we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolor and so montjoy fare you well the sum of all our answer is but this we would not seek a battle as we are nor as we are we say we will not shun it so tell your master we are in god's hand brother not in theirs march to the bridge it now draws toward night beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves and on tomorrow bid them march away gloucester 'tis true that we are in great danger the greater therefore should our courage be  good morrow brother bedford god almighty there is some soul of goodness in things evil would men observingly distill it out for our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers which is both healthful and good husbandry besides they are our outward consciences and preachers to us all admonishing that we should dress us fairly for our end thus may we gather honey from the weed and make a moral of the devil himself good morrow old sir thomas erpingham a good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of france 'tis good for men to love their present pains upon example so the spirit is eased and when the mind is quickened out of doubt the organs though defunct and dead before break up their drowsy grave and newly move with casted slough and fresh legerity lend me thy cloak sir thomas brothers both commend me to the princes in our camp do my good morrow to them and anon desire them all to my pavilion no my good knight go with my brothers to my lords of england i and my bosom must debate awhile and then i would no other company god a mercy old heart thou speak'st cheerfully a friend i am a gentleman of a company even so what are you then you are a better than the king harry le roy no i am a welshman yes do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yours and his kinsman too i thank you god be with you it sorts well with your fierceness though it appear a little out of fashion there is much care and valor in this welshman a friend under sir thomas erpingham even as men wracked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tide no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds methinks i could not die anywhere so contented as in the king's company his cause being just and his quarrel honorable so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his master's command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servant's damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrament of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is his vengeance so that here men are punished for before breach of the king's laws in now the king's quarrel where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited every subject's duty is the king's but every subject's soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed if i live to see it i will never trust his word after your reproof is something too round i should be angry with you if the time were convenient i embrace it give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it i will make it my quarrel there if ever i live to see it i will challenge it well i will do it though i take thee in the king's company indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no english treason to cut french crowns and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper upon the king let us our lives our souls our debts our careful wives our children and our sins lay on the king we must bear all o hard condition twin born with greatness subject to the breath of every fool whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing what infinite heart's ease must kings neglect that private men enjoy and what have kings that privates have not too save ceremony save general ceremony and what art thou thou idol ceremony what kind of god art thou that suffer'st more of mortal griefs than do thy worshipers what are thy rents what are thy comings in o ceremony show me but thy worth what is thy soul of adoration art thou aught else but place degree and form creating awe and fear in other men wherein thou art less happy being feared than they in fearing what drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet but poisoned flattery o be sick great greatness and bid thy ceremony give thee cure think'st thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation will it give place to flexure and low bending canst thou when thou command'st the beggar's knee command the health of it no thou proud dream that play'st so subtly with a king's repose i am a king that find thee and i know 'tis not the balm the scepter and the ball the sword the mace the crown imperial the intertissued robe of gold and pearl the farc\u00e8d title running 'fore the king the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world no not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony not all these laid in bed majestical can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave who with a body filled and vacant mind gets him to rest crammed with distressful bread never sees horrid night the child of hell but like a lackey from the rise to set sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night sleeps in elysium next day after dawn doth rise and help hyperion to his horse and follows so the ever running year with profitable labor to his grave and but for ceremony such a wretch winding up days with toil and nights with sleep had the forehand and vantage of a king the slave a member of the country's peace enjoys it but in gross brain little wots what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace whose hours the peasant best advantages good old knight collect them all together at my tent i'll be before thee o god of battles steel my soldiers' hearts possess them not with fear take from them now the sense of reck'ning or th' oppos\u00e8d numbers pluck their hearts from them not today o lord o not today think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown i richard's body have interr\u00e8d new and on it have bestowed more contrite tears than from it issued forc\u00e8d drops of blood five hundred poor i have in yearly pay who twice a day their withered hands hold up toward heaven to pardon blood and i have built two chantries where the sad and solemn priests sing still for richard's soul more will i do  though all that i can do is nothing worth since that my penitence comes after all imploring pardon my brother gloucester's voice ay i know thy errand i will go with thee the day my friends and all things stay for me what's he that wishes so my cousin westmoreland no my fair cousin if we are marked to die we are enough to do our country loss and if to live the fewer men the greater share of honor god's will i pray thee wish not one man more by jove i am not covetous for gold nor care i who doth feed upon my cost it yearns me not if men my garments wear such outward things dwell not in my desires but if it be a sin to covet honor i am the most offending soul alive no 'faith my coz wish not a man from england god's peace i would not lose so great an honor as one man more methinks would share from me for the best hope i have o do not wish one more rather proclaim it westmoreland through my host that he which hath no stomach to this fight let him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy put into his purse we would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us this day is called the feast of crispian he that outlives this day and comes safe home will stand o' tiptoe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of crispian he that shall see this day and live old age will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say tomorrow is saint crispian then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars old men forget yet all shall be forgot but he'll remember with advantages what feats he did that day then shall our names familiar in his mouth as household words harry the king bedford and exeter warwick and talbot salisbury and gloucester be in their flowing cups freshly remembered this story shall the good man teach his son and crispin crispian shall ne'er go by from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remember\u00e8d  we few we happy few we band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile this day shall gentle his condition and gentlemen in england now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon saint crispin's day all things are ready if our minds be so thou dost not wish more help from england coz why now thou hast unwished five thousand men which likes me better than to wish us one  you know your places god be with you all who hath sent thee now i pray thee bear my former answer back bid them achieve me and then sell my bones good god why should they mock poor fellows thus the man that once did sell the lion's skin while the beast lived was killed with hunting him a many of our bodies shall no doubt find native graves upon the which i trust shall witness live in brass of this day's work and those that leave their valiant bones in france dying like men though buried in your dunghills they shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them and draw their honors reeking up to heaven leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france mark then abounding valor in our english that being dead like to the bullet's crazing break out into a second course of mischief killing in relapse of mortality let me speak proudly tell the constable we are but warriors for the working day our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched with rainy marching in the painful field there's not a piece of feather in our host  good argument i hope we will not fly  and time hath worn us into slovenry but by the mass our hearts are in the trim and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night they'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck the gay new coats o'er the french soldiers' heads and turn them out of service if they do this as if god please they shall my ransom then will soon be levied herald save thou thy labor come thou no more for ransom gentle herald they shall have none i swear but these my joints which if they have as i will leave 'em them shall yield them little tell the constable i fear thou wilt once more come

lives he good uncle thrice within this hour i saw him down thrice up again and fighting from helmet to the spur all blood he was i blame you not for hearing this i must perforce compound with my full eyes or they will issue too but hark what new alarum is this same the french have reinforced their scattered men then every soldier kill his prisoners give the word through i was not angry since i came to france until this instant take a trumpet herald ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill if they will fight with us bid them come down or void the field they do offend our sight if they'll do neither we will come to them and make them skirr away as swift as stones enforc\u00e8d from the old assyrian slings besides we'll cut the throats of those we have and not a man of them that we shall take shall taste our mercy go and tell them so how now what means this herald know'st thou not that i have fined these bones of mine for ransom com'st thou again for ransom i tell thee truly herald i

praise from god which is his only yes captain but with this acknowledgment that god fought for us do we all holy rites let there be sung non nobis and te deum the dead with charity enclosed in clay and then to calais and to england then where ne'er from france arrived more happy men peace to this meeting wherefor we are met unto our brother france and to our sister health and fair time of day joy and good wishes to our most fair and princely cousin katherine  and as a branch and member of this royalty by whom this great assembly is contrived we do salute you duke of burgundy  and princes french and peers health to you all to cry amen to that thus we appear if duke of burgundy you would the peace whose want gives growth to th' imperfections which you have cited you must buy that peace with full accord to all our just demands whose tenors and particular effects you have enscheduled briefly in your hands well then the peace which you before so urged lies in his answer brother we shall go uncle exeter and brother clarence and you brother gloucester warwick and huntington go with the king and take with you free power to ratify augment or alter as your wisdoms best shall see advantageable for our dignity anything in or out of our demands and we'll consign thereto will you fair sister go with the princes or stay here with us yet leave our cousin katherine here with us she is our capital demand comprised within the forerank of our articles fair katherine and most fair will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady's ear and plead his love suit to her gentle heart o fair katherine if you will love me soundly with your french heart i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue do you like me kate an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel i said so dear katherine and i must not blush to affirm it what says she fair one that the tongues of men are full of deceits the princess is the better englishwoman  i' faith kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding i am glad thou canst speak no better english for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my crown i know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say i love you then if you urge me farther than to say do you in faith i wear out my suit give me your answer i' faith do and so clap hands and a bargain how say you lady marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake kate why you undid me for the one i have neither words nor measure and for the other i have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength if i could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken i should quickly leap into a wife or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favors i could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes never off but before god kate i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor i have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which i never use till urged nor never break for urging if thou canst love a fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth sun burning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook i speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that i shall die is true but for thy love by the lord no yet i love thee too and while thou liv'st dear kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors they do always reason themselves out again what a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly if thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king and what say'st thou then to my love speak my fair and fairly i pray thee no it is not possible you should love the enemy of france kate but in loving me you should love the friend of france for i love france so well that i will not part with a village of it i will have it all mine and kate when france is mine and i am yours then yours is france and you are mine no kate i will tell thee in french which i am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new married wife about her husband's neck hardly to be shook off je quand sur le possession de france et quand vous avez le possession de moi let me see what then saint denis be my speed donc v\u00f4tre est france et vous \u00eates mienne it is as easy for me kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more french i shall never move thee in french unless it be to laugh at me no faith is 't not kate but thy speaking of my tongue and i thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one but kate dost thou understand thus much english canst thou love me can any of your neighbors tell kate i'll ask them come i know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet you'll question this gentlewoman about me and i know kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart but good kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because i love thee cruelly if ever thou beest mine kate as i have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt i get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier breeder shall not thou and i between saint denis and saint george compound a boy half french half english that shall go to constantinople and take the turk by the beard shall we not what say'st thou my fair flower de luce no 'tis hereafter to know but now to promise do but now promise kate you will endeavor for your french part of such a boy and for my english moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor how answer you la plus belle katherine du monde mon tr\u00e8s cher et divin d\u00e9esse now fie upon my false french by mine honor in true english i love thee kate by which honor i dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage now beshrew my father's ambition he was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was i created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when i come to woo ladies i fright them but in faith kate the elder i wax the better i shall appear my comfort is that old age that ill layer up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better and therefore tell me most fair katherine will you have me put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say harry of england i am thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but i will tell thee aloud england is thine ireland is thine france is thine and henry plantagenet is thine who though i speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good fellows come your answer in broken music for thy voice is music and thy english broken therefore queen of all katherine break thy mind to me in broken english wilt thou have me nay it will please him well kate it shall please him kate upon that i kiss your hand and i call you my queen then i will kiss your lips kate madam my interpreter what says she to kiss it is not a fashion for the maids in france to kiss before they are married would she say o kate nice customs curtsy to great kings dear kate you and i cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion we are the makers of manners kate and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find faults as i will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yielding you have witchcraft in your lips kate there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the french council and they should sooner persuade harry of england than a general petition of monarchs here comes your father i would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly i love her and that is good english our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me i cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and so i shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she must be blind too it is so and you may some of you thank love for my blindness who cannot see many a fair french city for one fair french maid that stands in my way shall kate be my wife i am content so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will is 't so my lords of england i pray you then in love and dear alliance let that one article rank with the rest and thereupon give me your daughter now welcome kate and bear me witness all that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen amen prepare we for our marriage on which day my lord of burgundy we'll take your oath and all the peers' for surety of our leagues then shall i swear to kate and you to me and may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be", "Ham_Claudius": "though yet of hamlet our dear brother's death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th' imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as 'twere with a defeated joy with an auspicious and a dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barred your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother's death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagu\u00e8d with this dream of his advantage he hath not failed to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears of this his nephew's purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell and now laertes what's the news with you you told us of some suit what is 't laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes have you your father's leave what says polonius take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will  but now my cousin hamlet and my son  how is it that the clouds still hang on you 'tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness 'tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschooled for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie 'tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son why 'tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again respeaking earthly thunder come away welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet's transformation so call it sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father's death that thus hath put him so much from th' understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and sith so neighbored to his youth and havior that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that opened lies within our remedy thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thou still hast been the father of good news o speak of that that do i long to hear thyself do grace to them and bring them in he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found the head and source of all your son's distemper well we shall sift him welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway it likes us well and at our more considered time we'll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labor go to your rest at night we'll feast together most welcome home but how hath she received his love as of a man faithful and honorable do you think 'tis this not that i know how may we try it further we will try it and can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose into these delights sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as 'twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behaved if 't be th' affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for o 'tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot's cheek beautied with plast'ring art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lacked form a little was not like madness there's something in his soul o'er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on 't it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatched go how fares our cousin hamlet i have nothing with this answer hamlet these words are not mine have you heard the argument is there no offense in 't what do you call the play give me some light away i like him not nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range therefore prepare you i your commission will forthwith dispatch and he to england shall along with you the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so near 's as doth hourly grow out of his brows arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage for we will fetters put about this fear which now goes too free footed thanks dear my lord o my offense is rank it smells to heaven it hath the primal eldest curse upon 't a brother's murder pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and like a man to double business bound i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect what if this curs\u00e8d hand were thicker than itself with brother's blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offense and what's in prayer but this twofold force to be forestall\u00e8d ere we come to fall or pardoned being down then i'll look up my fault is past but o what form of prayer can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder that cannot be since i am still possessed of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen may one be pardoned and retain th' offense in the corrupted currents of this world offense's gilded hand may shove by justice and oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law but 'tis not so above there is no shuffling there the action lies in his true nature and we ourselves compelled even to the teeth and forehead of our faults to give in evidence what then what rests try what repentance can what can it not yet what can it when one cannot repent o wretched state o bosom black as death o lim\u00e8d soul that struggling to be free art more engaged help angels make assay bow stubborn knees and heart

yet must not we put the strong law on him he's loved of the distracted multitude who like not in their judgment but their eyes and where 'tis so th' offender's scourge is weighed but never the offense

how long hath she been thus follow her close give her good watch i pray you o this is the poison of deep grief it springs all from her father's death and now behold o gertrude gertrude when sorrows come they come not single spies but in battalions first her father slain next your son gone and he most violent author of his own just remove the people muddied thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers for good polonius' death and we have done but greenly in hugger mugger to inter him poor ophelia divided from herself and her fair judgment without the which we are pictures or mere beasts last and as much containing as all these her brother is in secret come from france feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds and wants not buzzers to infect his ear with pestilent speeches of his father's death wherein necessity of matter beggared will nothing stick our person to arraign in ear and ear o my dear gertrude this like to a murd'ring piece in many places gives me superfluous death attend where is my switzers let them guard the door what is the matter the doors are broke what is the cause laertes that thy rebellion looks so giant like  let him go gertrude do not fear our person there's such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would acts little of his will tell me laertes why thou art thus incensed let him go gertrude  speak man dead let him demand his fill who shall stay you good laertes if you desire to know the certainty of your dear father is 't writ in your revenge that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe winner and loser will you know them then why now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman that i am guiltless of your father's death and am most sensibly in grief for it it shall as level to your judgment 'pear as day does to your eye laertes i must commune with your grief or you deny me right go but apart make choice of whom your wisest friends you will and they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me if by direct or by collateral hand they find us touched we will our kingdom give our crown our life and all that we call ours to you in satisfaction but if not be you content to lend your patience to us and we shall jointly labor with your soul to give it due content so you shall and where th' offense is let the great ax fall i pray you go with me now must your conscience my acquittance seal and you must put me in your heart for friend sith you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed but yet to me they're strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which she is so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection work like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timbered for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again but not where i have aimed them break not your sleeps for that you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more i loved your father and we love ourself and that i hope will teach you to imagine  how now what news from hamlet who brought them laertes you shall hear them  leave us high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom tomorrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return hamlet what should this mean are all the rest come back or is it some abuse and no such thing 'tis hamlet's character naked  and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise me if it be so laertes as how should it be so how otherwise will you be ruled by me to thine own peace if he be now returned as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to an exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practice and call it accident it falls right you have been talked of since your travel much and that in hamlet's hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege a very ribbon in the cap of youth  yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy i have seen myself and served against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft in 't he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as had he been encorpsed and demi natured with the brave beast so far he topped my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did a norman the very same he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defense and for your rapier most especial that he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the 'scrimers of their nation he swore had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposed them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming o'er to play with you now out of this  laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a pleurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick of th' ulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself indeed your father's son more than in words no place indeed should murder sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber hamlet returned shall know you are come home we'll put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practice requite him for your father let's further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance 'twere better not assayed therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this did blast in proof soft let me see we'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings  i ha 't when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink i'll have prepared him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping if he by chance escape your venomed stuck our purpose may hold there but stay what noise let's follow gertrude how much i had to do to calm his rage now fear i this will give it start again therefore let's follow pluck them asunder o he is mad laertes i pray thee good horatio wait upon him strengthen your patience in our last night's speech we'll put the matter to the present push  good gertrude set some watch over your son  this grave shall have a living monument an hour of quiet thereby shall we see till then in patience our proceeding be come hamlet come and take this hand from me give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet you know the wager i do not fear it i have seen you both but since he is better we have therefore odds set me the stoups of wine upon that table  if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmark's crown have worn give me the cups and let the kettle to the trumpet speak the trumpet to the cannoneer without the cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth now the king drinks to hamlet come begin and you the judges bear a wary eye stay give me drink hamlet this pearl is thine here's to thy health give him the cup our son shall win gertrude do not drink it is the poisoned cup it is too late i do not think 't part them they are incensed she swoons to see them bleed o yet defend me friends i am but hurt",

saucers sweet misprision once more i'll mark how love can vary wit now step i forth to whip hypocrisy ah good my liege i pray thee pardon me good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove these worms for loving that art most in love your eyes do make no coaches in your tears there is no certain princess that appears you'll not be perjured 'tis a hateful thing tush none but minstrels like of sonneting but are you not ashamed nay are you not all three of you to be thus much o'ershot you found his mote the king your mote did see but i a beam do find in each of three o what a scene of fool'ry have i seen of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen o me with what strict patience have i sat to see a king transform\u00e8d to a gnat to see great hercules whipping a gig and profound solomon to tune a jig and nestor play at pushpin with the boys and critic timon laugh at idle toys where lies thy grief o tell me good dumaine and gentle longaville where lies thy pain and where my liege's all about the breast a caudle ho not you to me but i betrayed by you i that am honest i that hold it sin to break the vow i am engag\u00e8d in i am betrayed by keeping company with men like you men of inconstancy when shall you see me write a thing in rhyme or groan for joan or spend a minute's time in pruning me when shall you hear that i will praise a hand a foot a face an eye a gait a state a brow a breast a waist a leg a limb  i post from love good lover let me go a toy my liege a toy your grace needs not fear it ah you whoreson loggerhead you were born to do me shame  guilty my lord guilty i confess i confess that you three fools lacked me fool to make up the mess he he and you and you my liege and i are pickpurses in love and we deserve to die o dismiss this audience and i shall tell you more true true we are four will these turtles be gone sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace as true we are as flesh and blood can be the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face young blood doth not obey an old decree we cannot cross the cause why we were born therefore of all hands must we be forsworn did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline that like a rude and savage man of ind at the first op'ning of the gorgeous east bows not his vassal head and strucken blind kisses the base ground with obedient breast what peremptory eagle sighted eye dares look upon the heaven of her brow that is not blinded by her majesty my eyes are then no eyes nor i berowne o but for my love day would turn to night of all complexions the culled sovereignty do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek where several worthies make one dignity where nothing wants that want itself doth seek lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues  fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not to things of sale a seller's praise belongs she passes praise then praise too short doth blot a withered hermit fivescore winters worn might shake off fifty looking in her eye beauty doth varnish age as if newborn and gives the crutch the cradle's infancy o 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine is ebony like her o word divine a wife of such wood were felicity o who can give an oath where is a book that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack if that she learn not of her eye to look no face is fair that is not full so black devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light o if in black my lady's brows be decked it mourns that painting and usurping hair should ravish doters with a false aspect and therefore is she born to make black fair her favor turns the fashion of the days for native blood is counted painting now and therefore red that would avoid dispraise paints itself black to imitate her brow your mistresses dare never come in rain for fear their colors should be washed away i'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here o if the streets were pav\u00e8d with thine eyes her feet were much too dainty for such tread nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn o 'tis more than need have at you then affection's men at arms o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beauty's tutors have enriched you with other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practicers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learn\u00e8d in a lady's eyes lives not alone immur\u00e8d in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind a lover's ear will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stopped love's feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockled snails love's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste for valor is not love a hercules still climbing trees in the hesperides subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical as bright apollo's lute strung with his hair and when love speaks the voice of all the gods make heaven drowsy with the harmony never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were tempered with love's sighs o then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility from women's eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in ought proves excellent then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools for wisdom's sake a word that all men love or for love's sake a word that loves all men or for men's sake the authors of these women or women's sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths it is religion to be thus forsworn for charity itself fulfills the law and who can sever love from charity advance your standards and upon them lords pell mell down with them but be first advised in conflict that you get the sun of them first from the park let us conduct them thither then homeward every man attach the hand of his fair mistress in the afternoon we will with some strange pastime solace them such as the shortness of the time can

of the great count himself she is too mean to have her name repeated all her deserving is a reserv\u00e8d honesty and that i have not heard examined how do you mean maybe the amorous count solicits

deny that she'll demand a ring the county wears that downward hath succeeded in his house from son to son some four or five descents since the first father wore it this ring he holds in most rich choice yet in his idle fire to buy his will it would not seem too dear howe'er repented after you see it lawful then it is no more but that your daughter ere she seems as won desires this ring appoints him an encounter in fine delivers me to fill the time herself most chastely absent after to marry her i'll add three thousand crowns to what is passed already why then tonight let us assay our plot which if it speed is wicked meaning in a lawful deed and lawful meaning in a lawful act where both not sin and yet a sinful fact but let's about it that you may well perceive i have not wronged you one of the greatest in the christian world shall be my surety 'fore whose throne 'tis needful ere i can perfect mine intents to kneel time was i did him a desir\u00e8d office dear almost

suppos\u00e8d dead the army breaking my husband hies him home where heaven aiding and by the leave of my good lord the king we'll be before our welcome nor you mistress ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labor to recompense your love doubt not but heaven hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower as it hath fated her to be my motive and helper to a husband but o strange men that can such sweet use make of what they hate when saucy trusting of the cozened thoughts defiles the pitchy night so lust doth play with what it loathes for that which is away but more of this hereafter you

please you to give this poor petition to the king and aid me with that store of power you have to come into his presence not here sir all's well that ends well yet though time seem so adverse and means unfit  i do beseech you whither is he gone i do beseech you sir since you are like to see the king before me commend the paper to his gracious hand which i presume shall render you no blame but rather make you thank your pains for it i will come after you with what good speed our means will make us means and you shall find yourself to be well thanked whate'er falls more we must to horse

jove or like a star disorbed nay if we talk of reason let's shut our gates and sleep manhood and honor should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts with this crammed reason reason and respect make livers pale and lustihood deject what's aught but as 'tis valued i take today a wife and my election is led on in the conduct of my will  my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores of will and judgment how may i avoid although my will distaste what it elected the wife i choose there can be no evasion to blench from this and to stand firm by honor we turn not back the silks upon the merchant when we have soiled them nor the remainder viands we do not throw in unrespective sieve because we now are full it was thought meet paris should do some vengeance on the greeks your breath with full consent bellied his sails the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce and did him service he touched the ports desired and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness wrinkles apollo's and makes pale the morning why keep we her the grecians keep our aunt is she worth keeping why she is a pearl whose price hath launched above a thousand ships and turned crowned kings to merchants if you'll avouch 'twas wisdom paris went  as you must needs for you all cried go go  if you'll confess he brought home worthy prize  as you must needs for you all clapped your hands and cried inestimable why do you now the issue of your proper wisdoms rate and do a deed that never fortune did beggar the estimation which you prized richer than sea and land o theft most base that we have stol'n what we do fear to keep but thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n that in their country did them that disgrace we fear to warrant in our native place 'tis our mad sister i do know her voice why brother hector we may not think the justness of each act such and no other than event doth form it nor once deject the courage of our minds because cassandra's mad her brainsick raptures cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel which hath our several honors all engaged to make it gracious for my private part i am no more touched than all priam's sons and jove forbid there should be done amongst us such things as might offend the weakest spleen to fight for and maintain why there you touched the life of our design were it not glory that we more affected than the performance of our heaving spleens i would not wish a drop of trojan blood spent more in her defense but worthy hector she is a theme of honor and renown a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds whose present courage may beat down our foes and fame in time to come canonize us for i presume brave hector would not lose so rich advantage of a promised glory as smiles upon the forehead of this action for the wide world's revenue sirrah walk off no pandarus i stalk about her door like a strange soul upon the stygian banks staying for waftage o be thou my charon and give me swift transportance to those fields where i may wallow in the lily beds proposed for the deserver o gentle pandar from cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings and fly with me to cressid i am giddy expectation whirls me round th' imaginary relish is so sweet that it enchants my sense what will it be when that the wat'ry palate taste indeed love's thrice repur\u00e8d nectar death i fear me swooning destruction or some joy too fine too subtle potent tuned too sharp in sweetness for the capacity of my ruder powers i fear it much and i do fear besides that i shall lose distinction in my joys as doth a battle when they charge on heaps the enemy flying even such a passion doth embrace my bosom my heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse and all my powers do their bestowing lose like vassalage at unawares encount'ring the eye of majesty you have bereft me of all words lady o cressid how often have i wished me thus what should they grant what makes this pretty abruption what too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love fears make devils of cherubins they never see truly o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupid's pageant there is presented no monster nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confined that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit are there such such are not we praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present we will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble few words to fair faith troilus shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer than troilus you know now your hostages your uncle's word and my firm faith why was my cressid then so hard to win and shall albeit sweet music issues thence your leave sweet cressid what offends you lady you cannot shun yourself well know they what they speak that speak so wisely o that i thought it could be in a woman  as if it can i will presume in you  to feed for aye her lamp and flames of love to keep her constancy in plight and youth outliving beauty's outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays or that persuasion could but thus convince me that my integrity and truth to you might be affronted with the match and weight of such a winnowed purity in love how were i then uplifted but alas i am as true as truth's simplicity and simpler than the infancy of truth o virtuous fight when right with right wars who shall be most right true swains in love shall in the world to come approve their truth by troilus when their rhymes full of protest of oath and big compare wants similes truth tired with iteration  as true as steel as plantage to the moon as sun to day as turtle to her mate as iron to adamant as earth to th' center  yet after all comparisons of truth as truth's authentic author to be cited as true as troilus shall crown up the verse and sanctify the numbers amen dear trouble not yourself the morn is cold trouble him not to bed to bed sleep kill those pretty eyes and give as soft attachment to thy senses as infants' empty of all thought i prithee now to bed o cressida but that the busy day waked by the lark hath roused the ribald crows and dreaming night will hide our joys no longer i would not from thee beshrew the witch with venomous wights she stays as tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love with wings more momentary swift than thought you will catch cold and curse me it is your uncle ha ha how now what's the matter is it so concluded how my achievements mock me i will go meet them and my lord aeneas we met by chance you did not find me here walk into her house i'll bring her to the grecian presently and to his hand when i deliver her think it an altar and thy brother troilus a priest there off'ring to it his own heart cressid i love thee in so strained a purity that the blest gods as angry with my fancy  more bright in zeal than the devotion which cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me a hateful truth from troy and troilus and suddenly where injury of chance puts back leave taking jostles roughly by all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips of all rejoindure forcibly prevents our locked embrasures strangles our dear vows even in the birth of our own laboring breath we two that with so many thousand sighs did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves with the rude brevity and discharge of one injurious time now with a robber's haste crams his rich thiev'ry up he knows not how as many farewells as be stars in heaven with distinct breath and consigned kisses to them he fumbles up into a loose adieu and scants us with a single famished kiss distasted with the salt of broken tears hark you are called some say the genius cries so to him that instantly must die  bid them have patience she shall come anon no remedy hear me my love be thou but true of heart  nay we must use expostulation kindly for it is parting from us i speak not be thou true as fearing thee for i will throw my glove to death himself that there is no maculation in thy heart but be thou true say i to fashion in my sequent protestation be thou true and i will see thee and i'll grow friend with danger wear this sleeve i will corrupt the grecian sentinels to give thee nightly visitation but yet be true hear why i speak it love the grecian youths are full of quality their loving well composed with gift of nature flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise how novelty may move and parts with person alas a kind of godly jealousy  which i beseech you call a virtuous sin  makes me afeard die i a villain then in this i do not call your faith in question so mainly as my merit i cannot sing nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk nor play at subtle games fair virtues all to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant but i can tell that in each grace of these there lurks a still and dumb discursive devil that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted no but something may be done that we will not and sometimes we are devils to ourselves when we will tempt the frailty of our powers presuming on their changeful potency come kiss and let us part good brother come you hither and bring aeneas and the grecian with you who i alas it is my vice my fault whiles others fish with craft for great opinion i with great truth catch mere simplicity whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns with truth and plainness i do wear mine bare fear not my truth the moral of my wit is plain and true there's all the reach of it welcome sir diomed here is the lady which for antenor we deliver you at the port lord i'll give her to thy hand and by the way possess thee what she is entreat her fair and by my soul fair greek if e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword name cressid and thy

eyes and ears as if those organs had deceptious functions created only to calumniate was cressid here she was not sure why my negation hath no taste of madness let it not be believed for womanhood think we had mothers do not give advantage to stubborn critics apt without a theme for depravation to square the general sex by cressid's rule rather think this not cressid nothing at all unless that this were she this she no this is diomed's cressida if beauty have a soul this is not she if souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies if sanctimony be the gods' delight if there be rule in unity

four lagging winters and four wanton springs end in a word such is the breath of kings i have too few to take my leave of you when the tongue's office should be prodigal to breathe the abundant dolor of the heart joy absent grief is present for that time to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten my heart will sigh when i miscall it so which finds it an enforc\u00e8d pilgrimage nay rather every tedious stride i make will but remember me what a deal of world i wander from the jewels that i love must i not serve a long apprenticehood to foreign passages and in the end having my freedom boast of nothing else but that i was a journeyman to grief o who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking on the frosty caucasus or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast or wallow naked in december snow by thinking on fantastic summer's heat o no the apprehension of the good gives but the greater feeling to the worse fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more than when he bites but lanceth not the sore then england's ground farewell sweet soil adieu my mother and my nurse that bears me yet where'er i wander boast of this i can though banished yet a trueborn englishman how far is it my lord to berkeley now of much less value is my company than your good words but who comes here i thank thee gentle percy and be sure i count myself in nothing else so happy as in a soul

wanton and effeminate boy takes on the point of honor to support so dissolute a crew and what said the gallant as dissolute as desperate yet through both i see some sparks of better hope which elder years may happily bring forth but who comes here what means our cousin that he stares and looks so wildly withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone what is the matter with our cousin now intended or

march sadly after grace my mournings here in weeping after this untimely bier", "Ant_Octavius": "you may see lepidus and henceforth know it is not caesar's natural vice to hate our great competitor from alexandria this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy more womanly than he hardly gave audience or vouchsafed to think he had partners you shall find there a man who is th' abstract of all faults that all men follow you are too indulgent let's grant it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet with knaves that smells of sweat say this becomes him  as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemish yet must antony no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness if he filled his vacancy with his voluptuousness full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him for 't but to confound such time that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud as his own state and ours 'tis to be chid as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge pawn their experience to their present pleasure and so rebel to judgment i should have known no less it hath been taught us from the primal state that he which is was wished until he were and the ebbed man ne'er loved till ne'er worth love comes feared by being lacked this common body like to a vagabond flag upon the stream goes to and back lackeying the varying tide to rot

though daintily brought up with patience more than savages could suffer thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets the barks of trees thou brows\u00e8d on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on and all this  it wounds thine honor that i speak it now  was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek so much as lanked not let his shames quickly drive him to rome 'tis time we twain did show ourselves i' th' field and to that end assemble we immediate council pompey thrives in our idleness till which encounter it is my business too farewell doubt not sir i knew it for my bond i do not know maecenas ask agrippa welcome to rome sit nay then i must be laughed at if or for nothing or a little i should say myself offended and with you chiefly i' th' world more laughed at that i should once name you derogately when to sound your name it not concerned me no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt yet if you there did practice on my state your being in egypt might be my question you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me your wife and brother made wars upon me and their contestation was theme for you you were the word of war you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patched up your excuses i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria you did pocket up my letters and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience you have broken the article of your oath which you shall never have tongue to charge me with to lend me arms and aid when i required them the which you both denied i do not much dislike the matter but the manner of his speech for 't cannot be we shall remain in friendship our conditions so diff'ring in their acts yet if i knew what hoop should hold us staunch from edge to edge o' th' world i would pursue it speak agrippa say not so agrippa if cleopatra heard you your reproof were well deserved of rashness not till he hears how antony is touched with what is spoke already the power of caesar and his power unto octavia there's my hand a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never fly off our loves again about the mount misena great and increasing but by sea he is an absolute master with most gladness and do invite you to my sister's view whither straight i'll lead you goodnight most meet that first we come to words and therefore have we our written purposes before us sent which if thou hast considered let us know if 'twill tie up thy discontented sword and carry back to sicily much tall youth that else must perish here take your time there's the point and what may follow to try a larger fortune that's our offer since i saw you last there's a change upon you that's the next to do show 's the way sir will this description satisfy him i could well forbear 't it's monstrous labor when i wash my brain and it grows fouler possess it i'll make answer but i had rather fast from all four days than drink so much in one cup us till the world go round cup us till the world go round what would you more pompey goodnight good brother let me request you off our graver business frowns at this levity gentle lords let's part you see we have burnt our cheeks strong enobarb is weaker than the wine and mine own tongue splits what it speaks the wild disguise hath almost anticked us all what needs more words goodnight good antony your hand you take from me a great part of myself use me well in 't sister prove such a wife as my thoughts make thee and as my farthest bond shall pass on thy approof most noble antony let not the piece of virtue which is set betwixt us as the cement of our love to keep it builded be the ram to batter the fortress of it for better might we have loved without this mean if on both parts this be not cherished i have said farewell my dearest sister fare thee well the elements be kind to thee and make thy spirits all of comfort fare thee well what octavia no sweet octavia you shall hear from me still the time shall not outgo my thinking on you adieu be happy farewell farewell contemning rome he has done all this and more in alexandria here's the manner of 't i' th' marketplace on a tribunal silvered cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned at the feet sat caesarion whom they call my father's son and all the unlawful issue that their lust since then hath made between them unto her he gave the stablishment of egypt made her of lower syria cyprus lydia absolute queen i' th' common showplace where they exercise his sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings great media parthia and armenia he gave to alexander to ptolemy he assigned syria cilicia and phoenicia she in th' habiliments of the goddess isis that day appeared and oft before gave audience as 'tis reported so the people knows it and have now received his accusations caesar and that having in sicily sextus pompeius spoiled we had not rated him his part o' th' isle then does he say he lent me some shipping unrestored lastly he frets that lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposed and being that we detain all his revenue 'tis done already and the messenger gone i have told him lepidus was grown too cruel that he his high authority abused and did deserve his change for what i have conquered i grant him part but then in his armenia and other of his conquered kingdoms i demand the like nor must not then be yielded to in this that ever i should call thee castaway why have you stol'n upon us thus you come not like caesar's sister the wife of antony should have an army for an usher and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear the trees by th' way should have borne men and expectation fainted longing for what it had not nay the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven raised by your populous troops but you are come a market maid to rome and have prevented the ostentation of our love which left unshown is often left unloved we should have met you by sea and land supplying every stage with an augmented greeting which soon he granted being an abstract 'tween his lust and him i have eyes upon him and his affairs come to me on the wind where is he now no my most wrong\u00e8d sister cleopatra hath nodded him to her he hath given his empire up to a whore who now are levying the kings o' th' earth for war he hath assembled bocchus the king of libya archelaus of cappadocia philadelphos king of paphlagonia the thracian king adallas king manchus of arabia king of pont herod of jewry mithridates king of comagen polemon and amyntas the kings of mede and lycaonia with a more larger list of scepters welcome hither your letters did withhold our breaking forth till we perceived both how you were wrong led and we in negligent danger cheer your heart be you not troubled with the time which drives o'er your content these strong necessities but let determined things to destiny hold unbewailed their way welcome to rome nothing more dear to me you are abused beyond the mark of thought and the high gods to do you justice makes his ministers of us and those that love you best of comfort and ever welcome to us most certain sister welcome pray you be ever known to patience my dear'st sister taurus strike not by land keep whole provoke not battle till we have done at sea do not exceed the prescript of this scroll our fortune lies upon this jump let him appear that's come from antony know you him approach and speak be 't so declare thine office for antony i have no ears to his request the queen of audience nor desire shall fail so she from egypt drive her all disgrac\u00e8d friend or take his life there this if she perform she shall not sue unheard so to them both bring him through the bands to try thy eloquence now 'tis time dispatch from antony win cleopatra promise and in our name what she requires add more from thine invention offers women are not in their best fortunes strong but want will perjure the ne'er touched vestal try thy cunning thidias make thine own edict for thy pains which we will answer as a law observe how antony becomes his flaw and what thou think'st his very action speaks in every power that moves he calls me boy and chides as he had power to beat me out of egypt my messenger he hath whipped with rods dares me to personal combat caesar to antony let the old ruffian know i have many other ways to die meantime laugh at his challenge let our best heads know that tomorrow the last of many battles we mean to fight within our files there are of those that served mark antony but late enough to fetch him in see it done and feast the army we have store to do 't and they have earned the waste poor antony go forth agrippa and begin the fight our will is antony be took alive make it so known the time of universal peace is near prove this a prosp'rous day the three nooked world shall bear the olive freely go charge agrippa plant those that have revolted in the vant that antony may seem to spend his fury upon himself but being charged we will be still by land  which as i take 't we shall for his best force is forth to man his galleys to the vales and hold our best advantage go to him dolabella bid him yield being so frustrate tell him he mocks the pauses that he makes wherefore is that and what art thou that dar'st appear thus to us what is 't thou say'st the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack the round world should have shook lions into civil streets and citizens to their dens the death of antony is not a single doom in the name lay a moiety of the world look you sad friends the gods rebuke me but it is tidings to wash the eyes of kings o antony i have followed thee to this but we do lance diseases in our bodies i must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day or look on thine we could not stall together in the whole world but yet let me lament with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts that thou my brother my competitor in top of all design my mate in empire friend and companion in the front of war the arm of mine own body and the heart where mine his thoughts did kindle that our stars unreconciliable should divide our equalness to this hear me good friends  but i will tell you at some meeter season the business of this man looks out of him we'll hear him what he says whence are you bid her have good heart she soon shall know of us by some of ours how honorable and how kindly we determine for her for caesar cannot live to be ungentle come hither proculeius go and say we purpose her no shame give her what comforts the quality of her passion shall require lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke she do defeat us for her life in rome would be eternal in our triumph go and with your speediest bring us what she says and how you find of her gallus go you along where's dolabella to second proculeius let him alone for i remember now how he's employed he shall in time be ready go with me to my tent where you shall see how hardly i was drawn into this war how calm and gentle i proceeded still in all my writings go with me and see what i can show in this which is the queen of egypt arise you shall not kneel i pray you rise rise egypt take to you no hard thoughts the record of what injuries you did us though written in our flesh we shall remember as things but done by chance cleopatra know we will extenuate rather than enforce if you apply yourself to our intents which towards you are most gentle you shall find a benefit in this change but if you seek to lay on me a cruelty by taking antony's course you shall bereave yourself of my good purposes and put your children to that destruction which i'll guard them from if thereon you rely i'll take my leave you shall advise me in all for cleopatra nay blush not cleopatra i approve your wisdom in the deed good queen let us entreat you  forbear seleucus cleopatra not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged put we i' th' roll of conquest still be 't yours bestow it at your pleasure and believe caesar's no merchant to make prize with you of things that merchants sold therefore be cheered make not your thoughts your prisons no dear queen for we intend so to dispose you as yourself shall give us counsel feed and sleep our care and pity is so much upon you that we remain your friend and so adieu not so adieu bravest at the last she leveled at our purposes and being royal took her own way the manner of their deaths i do not see them bleed poisoned then o noble weakness if they had swallowed poison 'twould appear by external swelling but she looks like sleep as she would catch another antony in her strong toil of grace most probable that so she died for her physician tells me she hath pursued conclusions infinite of easy ways to die take up her bed and bear her women from the monument she shall be buried by her antony no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous high events as these strike those that make them and their story is no less in pity than his glory which brought them to be lamented our army shall in solemn show attend this funeral and then

more dishonorable ragged than an old feazed ancient and such have i to fill up the rooms of them as have bought out their services that you would think that i had a hundred and fifty tattered

better part i have saved my life zounds i am afraid of this gunpowder percy though he be dead how if he should counterfeit too and rise by my faith i am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit therefore i'll make him sure yea and i'll swear i killed him why may not he rise as well as i nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me therefore sirrah with a new wound in your thigh come you

for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by the o'ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o'erleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature's livery or fortune's star his virtues else be they

carrion have you a daughter let her not walk i' th' sun conception is a blessing but as your daughter may conceive friend look to 't words words words between who slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have gray beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself sir shall grow old as i am if like a crab you could go backward into my grave you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life these tedious old fools my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do you both nor the soles of her shoe then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favors in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what news then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither denmark's a prison a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o' th' worst why then 'tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams a dream itself is but a shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows shall we to th' court for by my fay i cannot reason no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come come deal justly with me come come nay speak anything but to th' purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color i know the good king and queen have sent for you that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer can charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen molt no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o'erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor women neither though by your smiling you seem to say so why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute on me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' th' sear and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for 't what players are they how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed how comes it do they grow rusty what are they children who maintains 'em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession is 't possible do the boys carry it away it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little 'sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come then th' appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outwards should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived i am but mad north

e'en to 't like french falconers fly at anything we see we'll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million 'twas caviary to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in 't i chiefly loved 'twas aeneas' tale to dido and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of priam's slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th' hyrcanian beast  'tis not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couch\u00e8d in th' ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smeared with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly tricked with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons baked and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damn\u00e8d light to their lord's murder roasted in wrath and fire and thus o'ersiz\u00e8d with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you it shall to the barber's with your beard  prithee say on he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba the mobl\u00e8d queen 'tis well i'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live god's bodykins man much better use every man after his desert and who shall 'scape whipping use them after your own honor and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in follow him friends we'll hear a play tomorrow dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago we'll ha 't tomorrow night you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in 't could you not very well follow that lord and look you mock him not my good friends i'll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore ay so good bye to you now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wanned tears in his eyes distraction in his aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what's hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appall the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damned defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i' th' throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha 'swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeon livered and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave's offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murdered prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a stallion fie upon 't foh about my brains hum i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i'll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i'll observe his looks i'll tent him to the quick if he do blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be a devil and the devil hath power t' assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i'll have grounds more relative than this the play's the thing wherein i'll catch the conscience of the king to be or not to be that is the question whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep  no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished to die to sleep  to sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there's the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time th' oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely the pangs of despised love the law's delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of th' unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pitch and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remembered i humbly thank you well no not i i never gave you aught ha ha are you honest are you fair that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offenses at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where's your father let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in 's own house farewell if thou dost marry i'll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell i have heard of your paintings too well enough god hath given you one face and you make yourselves another you jig and amble and you lisp you nickname god's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance go to i'll no more on 't it hath made me mad i say we will have no more marriage those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are to a nunnery go speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of our players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so o'erdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it makes the unskillful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theater of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having th' accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that's villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready how now my lord will the king hear this piece of work bid the players make haste will you two help to hasten them what ho horatio horatio thou art e'en as just a man as e'er my conversation coped withal nay do not think i flatter for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits to feed and clothe thee why should the poor be flattered no let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning dost thou hear since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish her election hath sealed thee for herself for thou hast been as one in suffering all that suffers nothing a man that fortune's buffets and rewards hast ta'en with equal thanks and blessed are those whose blood and judgment are so well commeddled that they are not a pipe for fortune's finger to sound what stop she please give me that man that is not passion's slave and i will wear him in my heart's core ay in my heart of heart as i do thee something too much of this  there is a play tonight before the king one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my father's death i prithee when thou seest that act afoot even with the very comment of thy soul observe my uncle if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech it is a damn\u00e8d ghost that we have seen and my imaginations are as foul as vulcan's stithy give him heedful note for i mine eyes will rivet to his face and after we will both our judgments join in censure of his seeming they are coming to the play i must be idle get you a place excellent i' faith of the chameleon's dish i eat the air promise crammed you cannot feed capons so no nor mine now my lord you played once i' th' university you say what did you enact it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there be the players ready no good mother here's metal more attractive lady shall i lie in your lap i mean my head upon your lap do you think i meant country matters that's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs nothing who i o god your only jig maker what should a man do but be merry for look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died within 's two hours so long nay then let the devil wear black for i'll have a suit of sables o heavens die two months ago and not forgotten yet then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year but by 'r lady he must build churches then or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the hobby horse whose epitaph is for oh for oh the hobby horse is forgot marry this is miching mallecho it means mischief we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel they'll tell all ay or any show that you will show him be not you ashamed to show he'll not shame to tell you what it means is this a prologue or the posy of a ring as woman's love that's wormwood if she should break it now madam how like you this play o but she'll keep her word no no they do but jest poison in jest no offense i' th' world the mousetrap marry how tropically this play is the image of a murder done in vienna gonzago is the duke's name his wife baptista you shall see anon 'tis a knavish piece of work but what of that your majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not let the galled jade wince our withers are unwrung this is one lucianus nephew to the king i could interpret between you and your love if i could see the puppets dallying it would cost you a groaning to take off mine edge so you mis take your husbands begin murderer pox leave thy damnable faces and begin come the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge he poisons him i' th' garden for his estate his name's gonzago the story is extant and written in very choice italian you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of gonzago's wife what frighted with false fire why let the strucken deer go weep the hart ungall\u00e8d play for some must watch while some must sleep thus runs the world away would not this sir and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn turk with me with two provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players a whole one i for thou dost know o damon dear this realm dismantled was of jove himself and now reigns here a very very pajock o good horatio i'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound didst perceive upon the talk of the poisoning ah ha come some music come the recorders for if the king like not the comedy why then belike he likes it not perdy come some music sir a whole history ay sir what of him with drink sir your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor for for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more choler i am tame sir pronounce you are welcome sir i cannot make you a wholesome answer my wit's diseased but sir such answer as i can make you shall command or rather as you say my mother therefore no more but to the matter my mother you say  o wonderful son that can so 'stonish a mother but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration impart we shall obey were she ten times our mother have you any further trade with us and do still by these pickers and stealers sir i lack advancement ay sir but while the grass grows the proverb is something musty o the recorders let me see one to withdraw with you why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil i do not well understand that will you play upon this pipe i pray you i do beseech you it is as easy as lying govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music look you these are the stops why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me you would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it speak 'sblood do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe call me what instrument you will though you can fret me you cannot play upon me god bless you sir do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel methinks it is like a weasel or like a whale then i will come to my mother by and by they fool me to the top of my bent i will come by and by by and by is easily said leave me friends 'tis now the very witching time of night when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world now could i drink hot blood and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on soft now to my mother o heart lose not thy nature let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom let me be cruel not unnatural i will speak daggers to her but use none my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites how in my words somever she be shent to give them seals never my soul consent now might i do it pat now he is a praying and now i'll do 't and so he goes to heaven and so am i revenged that would be scanned a villain kills my father and for that i his sole son do this same villain send to heaven why this is hire and salary not revenge he took my father grossly full of bread with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may and how his audit stands who knows save heaven but in our circumstance and course of thought 'tis heavy with him and am i then revenged to take him in the purging of his soul when he is fit and seasoned for his passage no up sword and know thou a more horrid hent when he is drunk asleep or in his rage or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed at game a swearing or about some act that has no relish of salvation in 't  then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven and that his soul may be as damned and black as hell whereto it goes my mother stays this physic but prolongs thy sickly days mother mother mother now mother what's the matter mother you have my father much offended go go you question with a wicked tongue what's the matter now no by the rood not so you are the queen your husband's brother's wife and would it were not so you are my mother come come and sit you down you shall not budge you go not till i set you up a glass where you may see the inmost part of you how now a rat dead for a ducat dead nay i know not is it the king a bloody deed almost as bad good mother as kill a king and marry with his brother ay lady it was my word thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell i took thee for thy better take thy fortune thou find'st to be too busy is some danger leave wringing of your hands peace sit you down and let me wring your heart for so i shall if it be made of penetrable stuff if damn\u00e8d custom have not brazed it so that it be proof and bulwark against sense such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and sets a blister there makes marriage vows as false as dicers' oaths o such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words heaven's face does glow o'er this solidity and compound mass with heated visage as against the doom is thought sick at the act look here upon this picture and on this the counterfeit presentment of two brothers see what a grace was seated on this brow hyperion's curls the front of jove himself an eye like mars' to threaten and command a station like the herald mercury new lighted on a kissing hill a combination and a form indeed where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance of a man this was your husband look you now what follows here is your husband like a mildewed ear blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes could you on this fair mountain leave to feed and batten on this moor ha have you eyes you cannot call it love for at your age the heyday in the blood is tame it's humble and waits upon the judgment and what judgment would step from this to this sense sure you have else could you not have motion but sure that sense is apoplexed for madness would not err nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thralled but it reserved some quantity of choice to serve in such a difference what devil was 't that thus hath cozened you at hoodman blind eyes without feeling feeling without sight ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope o shame where is thy blush rebellious hell if thou canst mutine in a matron's bones to flaming youth let virtue be as wax and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardor gives the charge since frost itself as actively doth burn and reason panders will nay but to live in the rank sweat of an enseam\u00e8d bed stewed in corruption honeying and making love over the nasty sty a murderer and a villain a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord a vice of kings a cutpurse of the empire and the rule that from a shelf the precious diadem stole and put it in his pocket  a king of shreds and patches  save me and hover o'er me with your wings you heavenly guards what would your gracious figure do you not come your tardy son to chide that lapsed in time and passion lets go by th' important acting of your dread command o say how is it with you lady on him on him look you how pale he glares his form and cause conjoined preaching to stones would make them capable do not look upon me lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects then what i have to do will want true color tears perchance for blood do you see nothing there nor did you nothing hear why look you there look how it steals away my father in his habit as he lived look where he goes even now out at the portal ecstasy my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time and makes as healthful music it is not madness that i have uttered bring me to the test and i the matter will reword which madness would gambol from mother for love of grace lay not that flattering unction to your soul that not your trespass but my madness speaks it will but skin and film the ulcerous place whiles rank corruption mining all within infects unseen confess yourself to heaven repent what's past avoid what is to come and do not spread the compost on the weeds to make them ranker forgive me this my virtue for in the fatness of these pursy times virtue itself of vice must pardon beg yea curb and woo for leave to do him good o throw away the worser part of it and live the purer with the other half good night but go not to my uncle's bed assume a virtue if you have it not that monster custom who all sense doth eat of habits devil is angel yet in this that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery that aptly is put on refrain tonight and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence the next more easy for use almost can change the stamp of nature and either the devil or throw him out with wondrous potency once more good night and when you are desirous to be blest i'll blessing beg of you for this same lord i do repent but heaven hath pleased it so to punish me with this and this with me that i must be their scourge and minister i will bestow him and will answer well the death i gave him so again good night i must be cruel only to be kind this bad begins and worse remains behind one word more good lady not this by no means that i bid you do let the bloat king tempt you again to bed pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse and let him for a pair of reechy kisses or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers make you to ravel all this matter out that i essentially am not in madness but mad in craft 'twere good you let him know for who that's but a queen fair sober wise would from a paddock from a bat a gib such dear concernings hide who would do so no in despite of sense and secrecy unpeg the basket on the house's top let the birds fly and like the famous ape to try conclusions in the basket creep and break your own neck down i must to england you know that there's letters sealed and my two schoolfellows whom i will trust as i will adders fanged they bear the mandate they must sweep my way and marshal me to knavery let it work for 'tis the sport to have the enginer hoist with his own petard and 't shall go hard but i will delve one yard below their mines and blow them at the moon o 'tis most sweet when in one line two crafts directly meet this man shall set me packing i'll lug the guts into the neighbor room mother good night indeed this counselor is now most still most secret and most grave who was in life a foolish prating knave  come sir to draw toward an end with you  good night mother safely stowed but soft what noise who calls on hamlet o here they come compounded it with dust whereto 'tis kin do not believe it that i can keep your counsel and not mine own besides to be demanded of a sponge what replication should be made by the son of a king ay sir that soaks up the king's countenance his rewards his authorities but such officers do the king best service in the end he keeps them like an ape an apple in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to be last swallowed when he needs what you have gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again i am glad of it a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear the body is with the king but the king is not with the body the king is a thing  of nothing bring me to him hide fox and all after at supper not where he eats but where he is eaten a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him your worm is your only emperor for diet we fat all creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for maggots your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes but to one table that's the end a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar in heaven send thither to see if your messenger find him not there seek him i' th' other place yourself but if indeed you find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby he will stay till you come for england good i see a cherub that sees them but come for england farewell dear mother my mother father and mother is man and wife man and wife is one flesh and so my mother  come for england good sir whose powers are these how purposed sir i pray you who commands them sir goes it against the main of poland sir or for some frontier why then the polack never will defend it two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats will not debate the question of this straw this is th' impostume of much wealth and peace that inward breaks and shows no cause without why the man dies i humbly thank you sir i'll be with you straight go a little before how all occasions do inform against me and spur my dull revenge what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed a beast no more sure he that made us with such large discourse looking before and after gave us not that capability and godlike reason to fust in us unused now whether it be bestial oblivion or some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on th' event a thought which quartered hath but one part wisdom and ever three parts coward i do not know why yet i live to say this thing's to do sith i have cause and will and strength and means to do 't examples gross as earth exhort me witness this army of such mass and charge led by a delicate and tender prince whose spirit with divine ambition puffed makes mouths at the invisible event exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune death and danger dare even for an eggshell rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honor's at the stake how stand i then that have a father killed a mother stained excitements of my reason and my blood and let all sleep while to my shame i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men that for a fantasy and trick of fame go to their graves like beds fight for a plot whereon the numbers cannot try the cause which is not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain o from this time forth my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth has this fellow no feeling of his business he sings in grave making 'tis e'en so the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once how the knave jowls it to the ground as if 'twere cain's jawbone that did the first murder this might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o'erreaches one that would circumvent god might it not or of a courtier which could say good morrow sweet lord how dost thou sweet lord this might be my lord such a one that praised my lord such a one's horse when he went to beg it might it not why e'en so and now my lady worm's chapless and knocked about the mazard with a sexton's spade here's fine revolution an we had the trick to see 't did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with them mine ache to think on 't there's another why may not that be the skull of a lawyer where be his quiddities now his quillities his cases his tenures and his tricks why does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery hum this fellow might be in 's time a great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures the very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box and must th' inheritor himself have no more ha is not parchment made of sheepskins they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that i will speak to this fellow  whose grave's this sirrah i think it be thine indeed for thou liest in 't thou dost lie in 't to be in 't and say it is thine 'tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest what man dost thou dig it for what woman then who is to be buried in 't how absolute the knave is we must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us by the lord horatio this three years i have took note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe how long hast thou been grave maker how long is that since ay marry why was he sent into england why how came he mad how strangely upon what ground how long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot why he more than another whose was it nay i know not this let me see alas poor yorick i knew him horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath bore me on his back a thousand times and now how abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rises at it here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft where be your gibes now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar not one now to mock your own grinning quite chapfallen now get you to my lady's chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this favor she must come make her laugh at that prithee horatio tell me one thing dost thou think alexander looked o' this fashion i' th' earth and smelt so pah to what base uses we may return horatio why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died alexander was buried alexander returneth to dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer barrel imperious caesar dead and turned to clay might stop a hole to keep the wind away o that that earth which kept the world in awe should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw but soft but soft awhile here comes the king the queen the courtiers who is this they follow and with such maim\u00e8d rites this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desp'rate hand fordo its own life 'twas of some estate couch we awhile and mark that is laertes a very noble youth mark what the fair ophelia what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wand'ring stars and makes them stand like wonder wounded hearers this is i hamlet the dane thou pray'st not well i prithee take thy fingers from my throat for though i am not splenitive and rash yet have i in me something dangerous which let thy wisdom fear hold off thy hand why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum what wilt thou do for her 'swounds show me what thou 't do woo't weep woo't fight woo't fast woo't tear thyself woo't drink up eisel eat a crocodile i'll do 't dost thou come here to whine to outface me with leaping in her grave be buried quick with her and so will i and if thou prate of mountains let them throw millions of acres on us till our ground singeing his pate against the burning zone make ossa like a wart nay an thou 'lt mouth i'll rant as well as thou hear you sir what is the reason that you use me thus i loved you ever but it is no matter let hercules himself do what he may the cat will mew and dog will have his day so much for this sir now shall you see the other you do remember all the circumstance sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly  and praised be rashness for it let us know our indiscretion sometime serves us well when our deep plots do pall and that should learn us there's a divinity that shapes our ends rough hew them how we will  up from my cabin my sea gown scarfed about me in the dark groped i to find out them had my desire fingered their packet and in fine withdrew to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unfold their grand commission where i found horatio a royal knavery an exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmark's health and england's too with ho such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the ax my head should be struck off here's the commission read it at more leisure but wilt thou hear now how i did proceed being thus benetted round with villainies or i could make a prologue to my brains they had begun the play i sat me down devised a new commission wrote it fair  i once did hold it as our statists do a baseness to write fair and labored much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeoman's service wilt thou know th' effect of what i wrote an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm might flourish as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma 'tween their amities and many suchlike es of great charge that on the view and knowing of these contents without debatement further more or less he should those bearers put to sudden death not shriving time allowed why even in that was heaven ordinant i had my father's signet in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in the form of th' other subscribed it gave 't th' impression placed it safely the changeling never known now the next day was our sea fight and what to this was sequent thou knowest already why man they did make love to this employment they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow 'tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incens\u00e8d points of mighty opposites does it not think thee stand me now upon  he that hath killed my king and whored my mother popped in between th' election and my hopes thrown out his angle for my proper life and with such cozenage is 't not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm and is 't not to be damned to let this canker of our nature come in further evil it will be short the interim's mine and a man's life's no more than to say one but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his i'll court his favors but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a tow'ring passion i humbly thank you sir dost know this waterfly thy state is the more gracious for 'tis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king's mess 'tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit put your bonnet to his right use 'tis for the head no believe me 'tis very cold the wind is northerly but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion i beseech you remember sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath what imports the nomination of this gentleman of him sir i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself what's his weapon that's two of his weapons but well  what call you the carriages the phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages  that's the french bet against the danish why is this all impawned as you call it how if i answer no sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty it is the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will yours he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for 's turn he did comply sir with his dug before he sucked it thus has he and many more of the same breed that i know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and out of an habit of encounter a kind of yeasty collection which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out i am constant to my purposes they follow the king's pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now in happy time she well instructs me i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart but it is no matter it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman not a whit we defy augury there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now 'tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man of aught he leaves knows what is 't to leave betimes let be give me your pardon sir i have done you wrong but pardon 't as you are a gentleman this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punished with a sore distraction what i have done that might your nature honor and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness was 't hamlet wronged laertes never hamlet if hamlet from himself be ta'en away and when he's not himself does wrong laertes then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it who does it then his madness if 't be so hamlet is of the faction that is wronged his madness is poor hamlet's enemy sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot my arrow o'er the house and hurt my brother i embrace it freely and will this brothers' wager frankly play  give us the foils come on i'll be your foil laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i' th' darkest night stick fiery off indeed no by this hand very well my lord your grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side this likes me well these foils have all a length come on sir one judgment i'll play this bout first set it by awhile come another hit what say you good madam i dare not drink yet madam by and by come for the third laertes you do but dally i pray you pass with your best violence i am afeard you make a wanton of me nay come again how does the queen o villainy ho let the door be locked treachery seek

unreclaim\u00e8d blood of general assault wherefore should you do this marry sir here's my drift and i believe it is a fetch of wit you laying these slight sullies on my son as 'twere a thing a little soiled i' th' working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assured he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country  and then sir does he this he does what was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence ay marry  he closes thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or th' other day or then or then with such or such and as you say there was he gaming there o'ertook in 's rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale  videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood take this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not god be wi' you fare you well observe his inclination in yourself and let him ply his music farewell how now ophelia what's the matter with what i' th' name of god mad for thy love what said he come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passions under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not coted him i feared he did but trifle and meant to wrack thee but beshrew my jealousy by heaven it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love come th' ambassadors from norway my good lord are joyfully returned have i my lord i assure my good liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath used to do that i have found the very cause of hamlet's lunacy give first admittance to th' ambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is 't but to be nothing else but mad but let that go madam i swear i use no art at all that he's mad 'tis true 'tis true 'tis pity and pity 'tis 'tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have while she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this now gather and surmise to the celestial and my soul's idol the most beautified ophelia  that's an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear thus in her excellent white bosom these etc  good madam stay awhile i will be faithful doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers i have not art to reckon my groans but that i love thee best o most best believe it adieu thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter shown me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear what do you think of me i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceived it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had played the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or looked upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i prescripts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repelled a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we mourn for hath there been such a time i would fain know that that i have positively said 'tis so when it proved otherwise take this from this if this be otherwise if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the center you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby at such a time i'll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall'n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters away i do beseech you both away i'll board him presently o give me leave how does my good lord hamlet do you know me my lord not i my lord honest my lord that's very true my lord i have my lord how say you by that still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i'll speak to him again what do you read my lord what is the matter my lord i mean the matter that you read my lord though this be madness yet there is method in 't will you walk out of the air my lord indeed that's out of the air how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my lord i will take my leave of you fare you well my lord you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is well be with you gentlemen my lord i have news to tell you the actors are come hither my lord upon my honor

hear and see the matter ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves read on this book that show of such an exercise may color your loneliness we are oft to blame in this 'tis too much proved that with devotion's visage and pious action we do sugar o'er the devil himself i hear him coming let's withdraw my lord it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i'll be placed so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine

some more audience than a mother since nature makes them partial should o'erhear the speech of vantage fare you well my liege i'll call upon you ere you go to bed and tell you what i know he will come straight look you lay home to him tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with and that your grace hath screened and stood between much heat and him i'll silence me even here pray you be round

and rent my very heart before i would have yielded to this league i never read but england's kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives and our king henry gives away his own to match with her that brings no vantages and so says york for he hath greatest cause anjou and maine are given to the french paris is lost the state of normandy stands on a tickle point now they are gone suffolk concluded on the articles the peers agreed and henry was well pleased to change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter i cannot blame them all what is 't to them 'tis thine they give away and not their own pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtesans still reveling like lords till all be gone whileas the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof while all is shared and all is borne away ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue while his own lands are bargained for and sold methinks the realms of england france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burnt unto the prince's heart of calydon anjou and maine both given unto the french cold news for me for i had hope of france even as i have of fertile england's soil a day will come when york shall claim his own and therefore i will take the nevilles' parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey and when i spy advantage claim the crown for that's the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right nor hold the scepter in his childish fist nor wear the diadem upon his head whose churchlike humors fits not for a crown then york be still awhile till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep to pry into the secrets of the state till henry surfeiting in joys of love with his new bride and england's dear bought queen and humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars then will i raise aloft the milk white rose with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed and in my standard bear the arms of york to grapple with the house of lancaster and force perforce i'll make him yield the crown whose bookish rule hath pulled fair england down if york have ill demeaned himself in france then let him be denied the regentship i'll tell thee suffolk why i am unmeet first for i cannot flatter thee in pride next if i be appointed for the place my lord of somerset will keep me here without discharge money or furniture till france be won into the dauphin's hands last time i danced attendance on his will till paris was besieged famished and lost doth anyone accuse york for a traitor base dunghill villain and mechanical i'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech  i do beseech your royal majesty let him have all the rigor of the law lay hands upon these traitors and their trash beldam i think we watched you at an inch what madam are you there the king and commonweal are deeply indebted for this piece of pains my lord protector will i doubt it not see you well guerdoned for these good deserts lord buckingham methinks you watched her well a pretty plot well chosen to build upon now pray my lord let's see the devil's writ what have we here the duke yet lives that henry shall depose but him outlive and die a violent death why this is just aio te aeacida romanos vincere posse well to the rest tell me what fate awaits the duke of suffolk by water shall he die and take his end what shall betide the duke of somerset let him shun castles safer shall he be upon the sandy plains than where castles mounted stand come come my lord these oracles are hardly attained and hardly understood the king is now in progress towards saint albans with him the husband of this lovely lady thither goes these news as fast as horse can carry them  a sorry breakfast for my lord protector at your pleasure my good lord who's within there ho invite my lords of salisbury and warwick to sup with me tomorrow night away now my good lords of salisbury and warwick our simple supper ended give me leave in this close walk to satisfy myself in craving your opinion of my title which is infallible to england's crown then thus edward the third my lords had seven sons the first edward the black prince prince of wales the second william of hatfield and the third lionel duke of clarence next to whom was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster the fifth was edmund langley duke of york the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester william of windsor was the seventh and last edward the black prince died before his father and left behind him richard his only son who after edward the third's death reigned as king till henry bolingbroke duke of lancaster the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt crowned by the name of henry the fourth seized on the realm deposed the rightful king sent his poor queen to france from whence she came and him to pomfret where as all you know harmless richard was murdered traitorously which now they hold by force and not by right for richard the first son's heir being dead the issue of the next son should have reigned the third son duke of clarence from whose line i claim the crown had issue philippa a daughter who married edmund mortimer earl of march edmund had issue roger earl of march roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor his eldest sister anne my mother being heir unto the crown married richard earl of cambridge who was son to edmund langley edward the third's fifth son by her i claim the kingdom she was heir to roger earl of march who was the son of edmund mortimer who married philippa sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence so if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger i am king we thank you lords but i am not your king till i be crowned and that my sword be stained with heart blood of the house of lancaster and that's not suddenly to be performed but with advice and silent secrecy do you as i do in these dangerous days wink at the duke of suffolk's insolence at beaufort's pride at somerset's ambition at buckingham and all the crew of them till they have snared the shepherd of the flock that virtuous prince the good duke humphrey 'tis that they seek and they in seeking that shall find their deaths if york can prophesy and neville this i do assure myself richard shall live to make the earl of warwick the greatest man in england but the king lords let him go please it your majesty this is the day appointed for the combat and ready are the appellant and defendant  the armorer and his man to enter the lists so please your highness to behold the fight i never saw a fellow worse bestead or more afraid to fight than is the appellant the servant of this armorer my lords dispatch this knave's tongue begins to double sound trumpets alarum to the combatants take away his weapon fellow thank god and the good wine in thy master's way and did he not in his protectorship levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers' pay in france and never sent it by means whereof the towns each day revolted cold news for me for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud and caterpillars eat my leaves away but i will remedy this gear ere long or sell my title for a glorious grave 'tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france and being protector stayed the soldiers' pay by means whereof his highness hath lost france in your protectorship you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of that england was defamed by tyranny so that by this you would not have him die 'tis york that hath more reason for his death but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk say as you think and speak it from your souls were 't not all one an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite as place duke humphrey for the king's protector and i and now we three have spoke it it skills not greatly who impugns our doom that somerset be sent as regent thither 'tis meet that lucky ruler be employed  witness the fortune he hath had in france no not to lose it all as thou hast done i rather would have lost my life betimes than bring a burden of dishonor home by staying there so long till all were lost show me one scar charactered on thy skin men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win what worse than naught nay then a shame take all i will my lord so please his majesty i am content provide me soldiers lords whiles i take order for mine own affairs my lord of suffolk within fourteen days at bristow i expect my soldiers for there i'll ship them all for ireland now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution be that thou hop'st to be or what thou art resign to death it is not worth th' enjoying let pale faced fear keep with the mean born man and find no harbor in a royal heart faster than springtime showers comes thought on thought and not a thought but thinks on dignity my brain more busy than the laboring spider weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies well nobles well 'tis politicly done to send me packing with an host of men i fear me you but warm the starv\u00e8d snake who cherished in your breasts will sting your hearts 'twas men i lacked and you will give them me i take it kindly yet be well assured you put sharp weapons in a madman's hands whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band i will stir up in england some black storm shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage until the golden circuit on my head like to the glorious sun's transparent beams do calm the fury of this mad bred flaw and for a minister of my intent i have seduced a headstrong kentishman john cade of ashford to make commotion as full well he can under the title of john mortimer in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade oppose himself against a troop of kerns and fought so long till that his thighs with darts were almost like a sharp quilled porpentine and in the end being rescued i have seen him caper upright like a wild morisco shaking the bloody darts as he his bells full often like a shag haired crafty kern hath he convers\u00e8d with the enemy and undiscovered come to me again and given me notice of their villainies this devil here shall be my substitute for that john mortimer which now is dead in face in gait in speech he doth resemble by this i shall perceive the commons' mind how they affect the house and claim of york say he be taken racked and tortur\u00e8d i know no pain they can inflict upon him will make him say i moved him to those arms say that he thrive as 'tis great like he will why then from ireland come i with my strength and reap the harvest which that rascal sowed for humphrey being dead as he shall be and henry put apart the next for me from ireland thus comes york to claim his right and pluck the crown from feeble henry's head ring bells aloud burn bonfires clear and bright to entertain great england's lawful king ah sancta maiestas who would not buy thee dear let them obey that knows not how to rule this hand was made to handle naught but gold i cannot give due action to my words except a sword or scepter balance it a scepter shall it have have i a soul on which i'll toss the fleur de luce of france whom have we here buckingham to disturb me the king hath sent him sure i must dissemble humphrey of buckingham i accept thy greeting art thou a messenger or come of pleasure scarce can i speak my choler is so great o i could hew up rocks and fight with flint i am so angry at these abject terms and now like ajax telamonius on sheep or oxen could i spend my fury i am far better born than is the king more like a king more kingly in my thoughts but i must make fair weather yet awhile till henry be more weak and i more strong  buckingham i prithee pardon me that i have given no answer all this while my mind was troubled with deep melancholy the cause why i have brought this army hither is to remove proud somerset from the king seditious to his grace and to the state upon thine honor is he prisoner then buckingham i do dismiss my powers  soldiers i thank you all disperse yourselves meet me tomorrow in saint george's field you shall have pay and everything you wish and let my sovereign virtuous henry command my eldest son nay all my sons as pledges of my fealty and love i'll send them all as willing as i live lands goods horse armor anything i have is his to use so somerset may die in all submission and humility york doth present himself unto your highness to heave the traitor somerset from hence and fight against that monstrous rebel cade who since i heard to be discomfited how now is somerset at liberty then york unloose thy long imprisoned thoughts and let thy tongue be equal with thy heart shall i endure the sight of somerset  false king why hast thou broken faith with me knowing how hardly i can brook abuse king did i call thee no thou art not king not fit to govern and rule multitudes which dar'st not no nor canst not rule a traitor that head of thine doth not become a crown thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff and not to grace an awful princely scepter that gold must round engirt these brows of mine whose smile and frown like to achilles' spear is able with the change to kill and cure here is a hand to hold a scepter up and with the same to act controlling laws give place by heaven thou shalt rule no more o'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler wouldst have me kneel first let me ask of these if they can brook i bow a knee to man sirrah call in my sons to be my bail i know ere they will have me go to ward they'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement o blood bespotted neapolitan outcast of naples england's bloody scourge the sons of york thy betters in their birth shall be their father's bail and bane to those that for my surety will refuse the boys see where they come i'll warrant they'll make it good i thank thee clifford say what news with thee nay do not fright us with an angry look we are thy sovereign clifford kneel again for thy mistaking so we pardon thee will you not sons look in a glass and call thy image so i am thy king and thou a false heart traitor call hither to the stake my two brave bears that with the very shaking of their chains they may astonish these fell lurking curs bid salisbury and warwick come to me nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon call buckingham and all the friends thou hast i am resolved for death or dignity the deadly handed clifford slew my steed but match to match i have encountered him and made a prey for carrion kites and crows even of the bonny beast he loved so well hold warwick seek thee out some other chase for i myself must hunt this deer to death with thy brave bearing should i be in love but that thou art so fast mine enemy so let it help me now against thy sword as i in justice and true right express it a dreadful lay address thee instantly thus war hath given thee peace for thou art still peace with his soul heaven if it be thy will of salisbury who can report of him that winter lion who in rage forgets ag\u00e8d contusions and all brush of time and like a gallant in the brow of youth repairs him with occasion this happy day is not itself nor have we won one foot if salisbury be lost i know our safety is to follow them for as i hear the king is fled to london to call a present court of parliament let us pursue him ere the writs go forth

master shallow fare you well gentle gentlemen on bardolph lead the men away as i return i will fetch off these justices i do see the bottom of justice shallow lord lord how subject we old men are to this vice of lying this same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about turnbull street and every third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the turk's tribute i do remember him at clement's inn like a man made after supper of a cheese paring when he was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife he was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible he was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores called him mandrake he came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle and swore they were his fancies or his good nights and now is this vice's dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of john o' gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and i'll be sworn he ne'er saw him but once in the tilt yard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal's men i saw it and told john o' gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel skin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court and now has he land and beefs well i'll be acquainted with him if i return and 't shall go hard but i'll make him a philosopher's two stones to me if the young dace be a bait for the old pike i see no reason in the law of nature but i may snap at him let time shape and there an end what's your name sir of what condition are you and of what place i pray well then colevile is your name a knight is your degree and your place the dale colevile shall be still your name a traitor your degree and the dungeon your place a place deep enough so shall you be still colevile of the dale as good a man as he sir whoe'er i am do you yield sir or shall i sweat for you if i do sweat they are the drops of thy lovers and they weep for thy death therefore rouse up fear and trembling and do observance to my mercy i have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name an i had but a belly of any indifferency i were simply the most active fellow in europe my womb my womb my womb undoes me here comes our general i would be sorry my lord but it should be thus i never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valor do you think me a swallow an arrow or a bullet have i in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought i have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility i have foundered ninescore and odd posts and here travel tainted as i am have in my pure and immaculate valor taken sir john colevile of the dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy but what of that he saw me and yielded that i may justly say with the hook nosed fellow of rome there cousin i came saw and overcame i know not here he is and here i yield him and i beseech your grace let it be booked with the rest of this day's deeds or by the lord i will have it in a particular ballad else with mine own picture on the top on 't colevile kissing my foot to the which course if i be enforced if you do not all show like gilt twopences to me and i in the clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element which show like pins' heads to her believe not the word of the noble therefore let me have right and let desert mount let it shine then let it do something my good lord that may do me good and call it what you will and a famous true subject took him i know not how they sold themselves but thou like a kind fellow gavest thyself away gratis and i thank thee for thee my lord i beseech you give me leave to go through gloucestershire and when you come to court stand my good lord pray in your good report i would you had but the wit 'twere better than your dukedom good faith this same young sober blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but that's no marvel he drinks no wine there's never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood and making many fish meals that they fall into a kind of male green sickness and then when they marry they get wenches they are generally fools and cowards which some of us should be too but for inflammation a good sherris sack hath a two fold operation in it it ascends me into the brain dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which delivered o'er to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit the second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts' extremes it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puffed up with this retinue doth any deed of courage and this valor comes of sherris so that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it a work and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use hereof comes it that prince harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant if i had a thousand sons the first human principle i would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack how now bardolph let them go i'll through gloucestershire and there will i visit master robert shallow esquire i have him already temp'ring between my finger and my thumb and shortly will i seal with him come away you must excuse me master robert shallow i'll follow you good master robert shallow bardolph look to our horses if i were sawed into quantities i should make four dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as master shallow it is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his they by observing of him do bear themselves like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned into a justice like servingman their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild geese if i had a suit to master shallow i would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master if to his men i would curry with master shallow that no man could better command his servants it is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed of their company i will devise matter enough out of this shallow to keep prince harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four terms or two actions and he shall laugh without intervallums o it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders o you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up i come master shallow i come master shallow fore god you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich this davy serves you for good uses he is your servingman and your husband there's a merry heart good master silence i'll give you a health for that anon i did not think master silence had been a man of this mettle well said master silence health and long life to you master silence why now you have done me right 'tis so from the court let him come in how now pistol what wind blew you hither pistol i pray thee now deliver them like a man of this world o base assyrian knight what is thy news let king cophetua know the truth thereof what is the old king dead away bardolph saddle my horse  master robert shallow choose what office thou wilt in the land 'tis thine pistol i will double charge thee with dignities carry master silence to bed master shallow my lord shallow be what thou wilt i am fortune's steward get on thy boots we'll ride all night o sweet pistol away bardolph come pistol utter more to me and withal devise something to do thyself good boot boot master shallow i know the young king is sick for me let us take any man's horses the laws of england are at my commandment blessed are they that have been my friends and woe to my lord chief justice stand here by me master robert shallow i will make the king do you grace i will leer upon him as he comes by and do but mark the countenance that he will give me come here pistol stand behind me o if i had had time to have made new liveries i would have bestowed the thousand pound i borrowed of you but 'tis no matter this poor show doth better this doth infer the zeal i had to see him it shows my earnestness of affection  my devotion  as it were to ride day and night and not to deliberate not to remember not to have patience to shift me  but to stand stained with travel and sweating with desire to see him thinking of nothing else putting all affairs else in oblivion as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him i will deliver her god save thy grace king hal my royal hal god save thee my sweet boy my king my jove i speak to thee my heart master shallow i owe you a thousand pound that can hardly be master shallow do not you grieve at this i shall be sent for in private to him look you he must seem thus to the world fear not your advancements i will be the man yet that shall make you great sir i will be as good as my word this that you heard was but a color fear no colors go with me to dinner  come lieutenant pistol come bardolph i shall be sent for soon at night my lord my lord", "JC_Antony": "caesar my lord i shall remember when caesar says do this it is performed caesar fear him not caesar he's not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given so to most noble caesar o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure fare thee well  i know not gentlemen what you intend who else must be let blood who else is rank if i myself there is no hour so fit as caesar's death's hour nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords made rich with the most noble blood of all this world i do beseech you if you bear me hard now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke fulfill your pleasure live a thousand years i shall not find myself so apt to die no place will please me so no mean of death as here by caesar and by you cut off the choice and master spirits of this age i doubt not of your wisdom let each man render me his bloody hand first marcus brutus will i shake with you  next caius cassius do i take your hand  now decius brutus yours now yours metellus  yours cinna and my valiant casca yours  though last not least in love yours good trebonius  gentlemen all alas what shall i say my credit now stands on such slippery ground that one of two bad ways you must conceit me either a coward or a flatterer  that i did love thee caesar o 'tis true if then thy spirit look upon us now shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death to see thy antony making his peace shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes  most noble in the presence of thy corpse had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies pardon me julius here wast thou bayed brave hart here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy lethe o world thou wast the forest to this hart and this indeed o world the heart of thee how like a deer strucken by many princes dost thou here lie pardon me caius cassius the enemies of caesar shall say this then in a friend it is cold modesty therefore i took your hands but was indeed swayed from the point by looking down on caesar friends am i with you all and love you all upon this hope that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous that's all i seek and am moreover suitor that i may produce his body to the marketplace and in the pulpit as becomes a friend speak in the order of his funeral be it so i do desire no more o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth that i am meek and gentle with these butchers thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever liv\u00e8d in the tide of times woe to the hand that shed this costly blood over thy wounds now do i prophesy which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue a curse shall light upon the limbs of men domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quartered with the hands of war all pity choked with custom of fell deeds and caesar's spirit ranging for revenge with ate by his side come hot from hell shall in these confines with a monarch's voice cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men groaning for burial you serve octavius caesar do you not caesar did write for him to come to rome thy heart is big get thee apart and weep passion i see is catching for mine eyes seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine began to water is thy master coming post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome no rome of safety for octavius yet hie hence and tell him so yet stay awhile thou shalt not back till i have borne this corpse into the marketplace there shall i try in my oration how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men according to the which thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things lend me your hand for brutus' sake i am beholding to you you gentle romans  friends romans countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury caesar not to praise him the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interr\u00e8d with their bones so let it be with caesar the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answered it here under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honorable man so are they all all honorable men come i to speak in caesar's funeral he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honorable man he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honorable man you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse was this ambition yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honorable man i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do know you all did love him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourn for him  o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason bear with me my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pause till it come back to me but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world now lies he there and none so poor to do him reverence o masters if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honorable men i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you than i will wrong such honorable men but here's a parchment with the seal of caesar i found it in his closet 'tis his will let but the commons hear this testament which pardon me i do not mean to read and they would go and kiss dead caesar's wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood  yea beg a hair of him for memory and dying mention it within their wills bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue have patience gentle friends i must not read it it is not meet you know how caesar loved you you are not wood you are not stones but men and being men hearing the will of caesar it will inflame you it will make you mad 'tis good you know not that you are his heirs for if you should o what would come of it will you be patient will you stay awhile i have o'ershot myself to tell you of it i fear i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed caesar i do fear it you will compel me then to read the will then make a ring about the corpse of caesar and let me show you him that made the will shall i descend and will you give me leave nay press not so upon me stand far off if you have tears prepare to shed them now you all do know this mantle i remember the first time ever caesar put it on 'twas on a summer's evening in his tent that day he overcame the nervii look in this place ran cassius' dagger through see what a rent the envious casca made through this the well belov\u00e8d brutus stabbed and as he plucked his curs\u00e8d steel away mark how the blood of caesar followed it as rushing out of doors to be resolved if brutus so unkindly knocked or no for brutus as you know was caesar's angel judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors' arms quite vanquished him then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling up his face even at the base of pompey's statue which all the while ran blood great caesar fell o what a fall was there my countrymen then i and you and all of us fell down whilst bloody treason flourished over us o now you weep and i perceive you feel the dint of pity these are gracious drops kind souls what weep you when you but behold our caesar's vesture wounded look you here here is himself marred as you see with traitors stay countrymen good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny they that have done this deed are honorable what private griefs they have alas i know not that made them do it they are wise and honorable and will no doubt with reasons answer you i come not friends to steal away your hearts i am no orator as brutus is but as you know me all a plain blunt man that love my friend and that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of him for i have neither wit nor words nor worth action nor utterance nor the power of speech to stir men's blood i only speak right on i tell you that which you yourselves do know show you sweet caesar's wounds poor poor dumb mouths and bid them speak for me but were i brutus and brutus antony there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of caesar that should move the stones of rome to rise and mutiny yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak why friends you go to do you know not what wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves alas you know not i must tell you then you have forgot the will i told you of here is the will and under caesar's seal to every roman citizen he gives to every several man seventy five drachmas hear me with patience moreover he hath left you all his walks his private arbors and new planted orchards on this side tiber he hath left them you and to your heirs forever common pleasures to walk abroad and recreate yourselves here was a caesar when comes such another now let it work mischief thou art afoot take thou what course thou wilt how now fellow where is he and thither will i straight to visit him he comes upon a wish fortune is merry and in this mood will give us anything belike they had some notice of the people how i had moved them bring me to octavius these many then shall die their names are pricked he shall not live look with a spot i damn him but lepidus go you to caesar's house fetch the will hither and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies this is a slight unmeritable man meet to be sent on errands is it fit the threefold world divided he should stand one of the three to share it octavius i have seen more days than you and though we lay these honors on this man to ease ourselves of diverse sland'rous loads he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold to groan and sweat under the business either led or driven as we point the way and having brought our treasure where we will then take we down his load and turn him off like to the empty ass to shake his ears and graze in commons so is my horse octavius and for that i do appoint him store of provender it is a creature that i teach to fight to wind to stop to run directly on his corporal motion governed by my spirit and in some taste is lepidus but so he must be taught and trained and bid go forth  a barren spirited fellow one that feeds on objects arts and imitations which out of use and staled by other men begin his fashion do not talk of him but as a property and now octavius listen great things brutus and cassius are levying powers we must straight make head therefore let our alliance be combined our best friends made our means stretched and let us presently go sit in council how covert matters may be best disclosed and open perils surest answer\u00e8d tut i am in their bosoms and i know wherefore they do it they could be content to visit other places and come down with fearful bravery thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage but 'tis not so octavius lead your battle softly on upon the left hand of the even field why do you cross me in this exigent no caesar we will answer on their charge make forth the generals would have some words in your bad strokes brutus you give good words witness the hole you made in caesar's heart crying long live hail caesar not stingless too villains you did not so when your vile daggers hacked one another in the sides of caesar you showed your teeth like apes and fawned like hounds and bowed like bondmen kissing caesar's feet whilst damn\u00e8d casca like a cur behind struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers old cassius still where is he this is not brutus friend but i assure you a prize no less in worth keep this man safe give him all kindness i had rather have such men my friends than enemies go on and see whe'er brutus be alive or dead and bring us word unto octavius' tent how everything is chanced this was the noblest roman of them all all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar he only in a general honest thought and common good to all made one of them his life was gentle and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world this was a man", "Cym_Posthumus": "please your highness i will from hence today my queen my mistress o lady weep no more lest i give cause to be suspected of more tenderness than doth become a

remainders of the court i am gone since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still by your pardon sir i was then a young traveler rather shunned to go even with what i heard than in my every action to be guided by others' experiences but upon my mended judgment  if i offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slight she holds her virtue still and i my mind being so far provoked as i was in france i would abate her nothing though i profess myself her adorer not her friend i praised her as i rated her so do i my stone more than the world enjoys you are mistaken the one may be sold or given or if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods

bold a persuasion and i doubt not you sustain what you're worthy of by your attempt a repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve more a punishment too what lady would you choose to assail i will wage against your gold gold to it my ring i hold dear as my finger 'tis part of it this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose i hope will you i shall but lend my diamond till

chaste as unsunned snow o all the devils this yellow iachimo in an hour was 't not or less at first perchance he spoke not but like a full acorned boar a german one cried o and mounted found no opposition but what he looked for should oppose and she should from encounter guard could i find out the woman's part in me for there's no motion that tends to vice in man but i affirm it is the woman's part be it lying note it the woman's flattering hers deceiving hers lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers ambitions covetings change of prides disdain nice longing slanders mutability all faults that have a name nay that hell knows why hers in part or all but rather all for even to vice they are not constant but are changing still one vice but of a minute old for one not half so old as that i'll write against them detest them curse them yet 'tis greater skill in a true hate to pray they have their will the very devils cannot plague them better yea bloody cloth i'll keep thee for i wished thou shouldst be colored thus you married ones if each of you should take this course how many must murder wives much better than themselves for wrying but a little o pisanio every good servant does not all commands no bond but to do just ones gods if you should have ta'en vengeance on my faults i never had lived to put on this so had you saved the noble imogen to repent and struck me wretch more worth your vengeance but alack you snatch some hence for little faults that's love to have them fall no more you some permit to second ills with ills each elder worse and make them dread it to the doers' thrift but imogen is your own do your best wills and make me blest to obey i am brought hither among th' italian gentry and to fight against my lady's kingdom 'tis enough that britain i have killed thy mistress peace i'll give no wound to thee therefore good heavens hear patiently my purpose i'll disrobe me of these italian weeds and suit myself as does a briton peasant so i'll fight against the part i come with so i'll die for thee o imogen even for whom my life is every breath a death and thus unknown pitied nor hated to the face of peril myself i'll dedicate let me make men know more valor in me than my habits show gods put the strength o' th' leonati in me to shame the guise o' th' world i will begin the fashion less without and more within i did though you it seems come from the fliers no blame be to you sir for all was lost but that the heavens fought the king himself of his wings destitute the army broken and but the backs of britons seen all flying through a strait lane the enemy full hearted lolling the tongue with slaught'ring having work more plentiful than tools to do 't struck down some mortally some slightly touched some falling merely through fear that the strait pass was dammed with dead men hurt behind and cowards living to die with lengthened shame close by the battle ditched and walled with turf which gave advantage to an ancient soldier an honest one i warrant who deserved so long a breeding as his white beard came to in doing this for 's country athwart the lane he with two striplings lads more like to run the country base than to commit such slaughter with faces fit for masks or rather fairer than those for preservation cased or shame  made good the passage cried to those that fled our britain's harts die

the way that they did and to grin like lions upon the pikes o' th' hunters then began a stop i' th' chaser a retire anon a rout confusion thick forthwith they fly chickens the way which they stooped eagles slaves the strides they victors made and now our cowards like fragments in hard voyages became the life o' th' need having found the backdoor open of the unguarded hearts heavens how they wound

o' th' field nay do not wonder at it you are made rather to wonder at the things you hear than to work any will you rhyme upon 't and vent it for a mock'ry here is one two boys an old man twice a boy a lane preserved the britons was the romans' bane 'lack to what end who dares not stand his foe i'll be his friend for if he'll do as he is made to do i know he'll quickly fly my friendship too you have put me into rhyme still going this is a lord o noble misery to be i' th' field and ask what news of me today how many would have given their honors to have saved their carcasses took heel to do 't and yet died too i in mine own woe charmed could not find death where i did hear him groan nor feel him where he struck being an ugly monster 'tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds sweet words or hath more ministers than we that draw his knives i' th' war well i will find him for being now a favorer to the briton no more a britoni have resumed again the part i came in fight i will no more but yield me to the veriest hind that shall once touch my shoulder great the slaughter is here made by th' roman great the answer be britons must take for me my ransom's death on either side i come to spend my breath which neither here i'll keep nor bear again but end it by some means for imogen a roman who had not now been drooping here if seconds had answered him most welcome bondage for thou art a way i think to liberty yet am i better than one that's sick o' th' gout since he had rather groan so in perpetuity than be cured by th' sure physician death who is the key t' unbar these locks my conscience thou art fettered more than my shanks and wrists you good gods give me the penitent instrument to pick that bolt then free forever is 't enough i am sorry so children temporal fathers do appease gods are more full of mercy must i repent i cannot do it better than in gyves desired more than constrained to satisfy if of my freedom 'tis the main part take no stricter render of me than my all i know you are more clement than vile men who of their broken debtors take a third a sixth a tenth letting them thrive again on their abatement that's not my desire for imogen's dear life take mine and though 'tis not so dear yet 'tis a life you coined it 'tween man and man they weigh not every stamp though light take pieces for the figure's sake you rather mine being yours and so great powers if you will take this audit take this life and cancel these cold bonds o imogen i'll speak to thee in silence sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot a father to me and thou hast created a mother and two brothers but o scorn gone they went hence so soon as they were born and so i am awake poor wretches that depend on greatness' favor dream as i have done wake and find nothing

to a dog for a new year's gift 'sblood the rogues slighted me into the river with as little remorse as they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies fifteen i' th' litter and you may know by my size that i have a kind of alacrity in sinking if the bottom were as deep as hell i should down i had been drowned but that the shore was shelvy and shallow a death that i abhor for the water swells a man and what a thing should i have been when i had been swelled by the lord i should have been a mountain of mummy come let me pour in some sack to the thames water for my belly's as cold as if i had swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the reins call her in take away these chalices go brew me a pottle of sack finely simple of itself i'll no pullet sperm in my brewage how now mistress ford i have

money well o here he comes now master brook you come to know what hath passed between me and ford's wife master brook i will not lie to you i was at her house the hour she appointed me very ill favoredly master brook no master brook but the peaking cornuto her husband master brook dwelling in a continual 'larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of our encounter after we had embraced kissed protested and as it were spoke the prologue of our comedy and at his heels a rabble of his companions thither provoked and instigated by his distemper and forsooth to search his house for his wife's love while i was there you shall hear as good luck would have it comes in one mistress page gives intelligence of ford's approach and in her invention and ford's wife's distraction they conveyed me into a buck basket by the lord a buck basket rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy napkins that master brook there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril nay you shall hear master brook what i have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good being thus crammed in the basket a couple of ford's knaves his hinds were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to datchet lane they took me on their shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the door who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket i quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it but fate ordaining he should be a cuckold held his hand well on went he for a search and away went i for foul clothes but mark the sequel master brook i suffered the pangs of three several deaths first an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bellwether next to be compassed like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head and then to be stopped in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease think of that a man of my kidney think of that that am as subject to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution and thaw it was a miracle to 'scape suffocation and in the height of this bath when i was more than half stewed in grease like a dutch dish to be thrown into the thames and cooled glowing hot in that surge like a horseshoe think of that hissing hot think of that master brook master brook i will be thrown into etna as i have been into thames ere i will leave her thus her husband is this morning gone a birding i have received from her another embassy of meeting 'twixt eight and nine is the hour master brook is it i will then address me to my appointment come to me at your convenient leisure and you shall know how i speed and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her adieu you shall have her master brook master brook you shall cuckold ford mistress ford your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance i see you are obsequious in your love and i profess requital to a hair's breadth not only mistress ford in the simple office of love but in all the accoutrement compliment and ceremony of it but are you sure of your husband now no i'll come no more i' th' basket may i not go out ere he come what shall i do i'll creep up into the chimney where is it i'll go out then good hearts devise something any extremity rather than a mischief how now mine host there was mine host an old fat woman even now with me but she's gone ay marry was it mussel shell what would you with her i spake with the old woman about it marry she says that the very same man that beguiled master slender of his chain cozened him of it what are they let us know 'tis 'tis his fortune to have her or no go say the woman told me so ay sir like who more bold ay that there was mine host one that hath taught me more wit than ever i learned before in my life and i paid nothing for it neither but was paid for my learning i would all the world might be cozened for i have been cozened and beaten too if it should come to the ear of the court how i have been transformed and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgeled they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me i warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till i were as crestfallen as a dried pear i never prospered since i forswore myself at primero well if my wind were but long enough i would repent now whence come you the devil take one party and his dam the other and so they shall be both bestowed i have suffered more for their sakes more than the villainous inconstancy of man's disposition is able to bear what tell'st thou me of black and blue i was beaten myself into all the colors of the rainbow and i was like to be apprehended for the witch of brentford but that my admirable dexterity of wit my counterfeiting the action of an old woman delivered me the knave constable had set me i' th' stocks i' th' common stocks for a witch come up into my chamber prithee no more prattling go i'll hold this is the third time i hope good luck lies in odd numbers away go they say there is divinity in odd numbers either in nativity chance or death away away i say time wears hold up your head and mince how now master brook master brook the matter will be known tonight or never be you in the park about midnight at herne's oak and you shall see wonders i went to her master brook as you see like a poor old man but i came from her master brook like a poor old woman that same knave ford her husband hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him master brook that ever governed frenzy i will tell you he beat me grievously in the shape of a woman for in the shape of man master brook i fear not goliath with a weaver's beam because i know also life is a shuttle i am in haste go along with me i'll tell you all master brook since i plucked geese played truant and whipped top i knew not what 'twas to be beaten till lately follow me i'll tell you strange things of this knave ford on whom tonight i will be revenged and i will deliver his wife into your hand follow strange things in hand master brook follow the windsor bell hath struck twelve the minute draws on now the hot blooded gods assist me remember jove thou wast a bull for thy europa love set on thy horns o powerful love that in some respects makes a beast a man in some other a man a beast you were also jupiter a swan for the love of leda o omnipotent love how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose a fault done first in the form of a beast o jove a beastly fault and then another fault in the semblance of a fowl think on 't jove a foul fault when gods have hot backs what shall poor men do for me i am here a windsor stag and the fattest i think i' th' forest send me a cool rut time jove or who can blame me to piss my tallow who comes here my doe my doe with the black scut let the sky rain potatoes let it thunder to the tune of greensleeves hail kissing comfits and snow eryngoes let there come a tempest of provocation i will shelter me here divide me like a bribed buck each a haunch i will keep my sides to myself my shoulders for the fellow of this walk and my horns i bequeath your husbands am i a woodman ha speak i like herne the hunter why now is cupid a child of conscience he makes restitution as i am a true spirit welcome what should this be i think the devil will not have me damned lest the oil that's in me should set hell on fire he would never else cross me thus they are fairies he that speaks to them shall die i'll wink and couch no man their works must eye heavens defend me from that welsh fairy lest he transform me to a piece of cheese o o o i do begin to perceive that i am made an ass and these are not fairies i was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies and yet the guiltiness of my mind the sudden surprise of my powers drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason that they were fairies see now how wit may be made a jack a lent when 'tis upon ill employment have i laid my brain in the sun and dried it that it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as this am i ridden with a welsh goat too shall i have a coxcomb of frieze 'tis time i were choked with a piece of toasted cheese seese and putter have i lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of english this is enough to be the decay of lust and late walking through the realm well i am your theme you have the start of me i am dejected i am not able to answer the welsh flannel ignorance itself is a plummet

whether our kinsman come to see his friends ourself and bushy bagot here and green observed his courtship to the common people how he did seem to dive into their hearts with humble and familiar courtesy what reverence he did throw away on slaves wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles and patient underbearing of his fortune as 'twere to banish their affects with him off goes his

our time of stay is short barkloughly castle call they this at hand needs must i like it well i weep for joy to stand upon my kingdom once again dear earth i do salute thee with my hand though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs as a long parted mother with her child plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth and do thee favors with my royal hands feed not thy sovereign's foe my gentle earth nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom and heavy gaited toads lie in their way doing annoyance to the treacherous feet which with usurping steps do trample thee yield stinging nettles to mine enemies and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a mortal touch throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies mock not my senseless conjuration lords this earth shall have a feeling and these stones prove arm\u00e8d soldiers ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellion's arms discomfortable cousin know'st thou not that when the searching eye of heaven is hid behind the globe that lights the lower world then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen in murders and in outrage boldly here but when from under this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole then murders treasons and detested sins the cloak of night being plucked from off their backs stand bare and naked trembling at themselves so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke who all this while hath reveled in the night whilst we were wand'ring with the antipodes shall see us rising in our throne the east his treasons will sit blushing in his face not able to endure the sight of day but self affrighted tremble at his sin not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king the breath of worldly men cannot depose the deputy elected by the lord for every man that bolingbroke hath pressed to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown god for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel then if angels fight weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right welcome my lord how far off lies your power but now the blood of twenty thousand men did triumph in my face and they are fled and till so much blood thither come again have i not reason to look pale and dead all souls that will be safe fly from my side for time hath set a blot upon my pride i had forgot myself am i not king awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest is not the king's name twenty thousand names arm arm my name a puny subject strikes at thy great glory look not to the ground you favorites of a king are we not high high be our thoughts i know my uncle york hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here mine ear is open and my heart prepared the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold say is my kingdom lost why 'twas my care and what loss is it to be rid of care strives bolingbroke to be as great as we greater he shall not be if he serve god we'll serve him too and be his fellow so revolt our subjects that we cannot mend they break their faith to god as well as us cry woe destruction ruin and decay the worst is death and death will have his day too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot what is become of bushy where is green that they have let the dangerous enemy measure our confines with such peaceful steps if we prevail their heads shall pay for it i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke o villains vipers damned without redemption dogs easily won to fawn on any man snakes in my heart blood warmed that sting my heart three judases each one thrice worse than judas would they make peace terrible hell make war upon their spotted souls for this no matter where of comfort no man speak let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth let's choose executors and talk of wills and yet not so for what can we bequeath save our depos\u00e8d bodies to the ground our lands our lives and all are bolingbroke's and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our bones for god's sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings  how some have been deposed some slain in war some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed some poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed all murdered for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp allowing him a breath a little scene to monarchize be feared and kill with looks infusing him with self and vain conceit as if this flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable and humored thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castle wall and farewell king cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence throw away respect tradition form and ceremonious duty for you have but mistook me all this while i live with bread like you feel want taste grief need friends subjected thus how can you say to me i am a king thou chid'st me well proud bolingbroke i come to change blows with thee for our day of doom  this ague fit of fear is overblown an easy task it is to win our own  say scroop where lies our uncle with his power speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour thou hast said enough beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth of that sweet way i was in to despair what say you now what comfort have we now by heaven i'll hate him everlastingly that bids me be of comfort anymore go to flint castle there i'll pine away a king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey that power i have discharge and let them go to ear the land that hath some hope to grow for i have none let no man speak again to alter this for counsel is but vain he does me double wrong that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue discharge my followers let them hence away from richard's night to bolingbroke's fair day we are amazed and thus long have we stood to watch the fearful bending of thy knee because we thought ourself thy lawful king an if we be how dare thy joints forget to pay their awful duty to our presence if we be not show us the hand of god that hath dismissed us from our stewardship for well we know no hand of blood and bone can gripe the sacred handle of our scepter unless he do profane steal or usurp and though you think that all as you have done have torn their souls by turning them from us and we are barren and bereft of friends yet know my master god omnipotent is mustering in his clouds on our behalf armies of pestilence and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of my precious crown tell bolingbroke for yon methinks he stands  that every stride he makes upon my land is dangerous treason he is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war but ere the crown he looks for live in peace ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons shall ill become the flower of england's face change the complexion of her maid pale peace to scarlet indignation and bedew her pastures' grass with faithful english blood northumberland say thus the king returns his noble cousin is right welcome hither and all the number of his fair demands shall be accomplished without contradiction with all the gracious utterance thou hast speak to his gentle hearing kind commends we do debase ourselves cousin do we not to look so poorly and to speak so fair shall we call back northumberland and send defiance to the traitor and so die o god o god that e'er this tongue of mine that laid the sentence of dread banishment on yon proud man should take it off again with words of sooth o that i were as great as is my grief or lesser than my name or that i could forget what i have been or not remember what i must be now swell'st thou proud heart i'll give thee scope to beat since foes have scope to beat both thee and me what must the king do now must he submit the king shall do it must he be deposed the king shall be contented must he lose the name of king i' god's name let it go i'll give my jewels for a set of beads my gorgeous palace for a hermitage my gay apparel for an almsman's gown my figured goblets for a dish of wood my scepter for a palmer's walking staff my subjects for a pair of carv\u00e8d saints and my large kingdom for a little grave a little little grave an obscure grave or i'll be buried in the king's highway some way of common trade where subjects' feet may hourly trample on their sovereign's head for on my heart they tread now whilst i live and buried once why not upon my head aumerle thou weep'st my tender hearted cousin we'll make foul weather with despis\u00e8d tears our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn and make a dearth in this revolting land or shall we play the wantons with our woes and make some pretty match with shedding tears as thus to drop them still upon one place till they have fretted us a pair of graves within the earth and therein laid there lies two kinsmen digged their graves with weeping eyes would not this ill do well well well i see i talk but idly and you laugh at me most mighty prince my lord northumberland what says king bolingbroke will his majesty give richard leave to live till richard die you make a leg and bolingbroke says ay down down i come like glist'ring pha\u00ebton wanting the manage of unruly jades in the base court base court where kings grow base to come at traitors' calls and do them grace in the base court come down down court down king for nightowls shriek where mounting larks should sing fair cousin you debase your princely knee to make the base earth proud with kissing it me rather had my heart might feel your love than my unpleased eye see your courtesy up cousin up your heart is up i know thus high at least although your knee be low your own is yours and i am yours and all well you deserve they well deserve to have that know the strong'st and surest way to get  uncle give me your hands nay dry your eyes tears show their love but want their remedies  cousin i am too young to be your father though you are old enough to be my heir what you will have i'll give and willing too for do we must what force will have us do set on towards london cousin is it so then i must not say no alack why am i sent for to a king before i have shook off the regal thoughts wherewith i reigned i hardly yet have learned to insinuate flatter bow and bend my knee give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me to this submission yet i well remember the favors of these men were they not mine did they not sometime cry all hail to me so judas did to christ but he in twelve found truth in all but one i in twelve thousand none god save the king will no man say amen am i both priest and clerk well then amen god save the king although i be not he and yet amen if heaven do think him me to do what service am i sent for hither give me the crown here cousin seize the crown here cousin on this side my hand on that side thine now is this golden crown like a deep well that owes two buckets filling one another the emptier ever dancing in the air the other down unseen and full of water that bucket down and full of tears am i drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high my crown i am but still my griefs are mine you may my glories and my state depose but not my griefs still am i king of those your cares set up do not pluck my cares down my care is loss of care by old care done your care is gain of care by new care won the cares i give i have though given away they 'tend the crown yet still with me they stay ay no no ay for i must nothing be therefore no no for i resign to thee now mark me how i will undo myself i give this heavy weight from off my head and this unwieldy scepter from my hand the pride of kingly sway from out my heart with mine own tears i wash away my balm with mine own hands i give away my crown with mine own tongue deny my sacred state with mine own breath release all duteous oaths all pomp and majesty i do forswear my manors rents revenues i forgo my acts decrees and statutes i deny god pardon all oaths that are broke to me god keep all vows unbroke are made to thee make me that nothing have with nothing grieved and thou with all pleased that hast all achieved long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit and soon lie richard in an earthy pit god save king henry unkinged richard says and send him many years of sunshine days what more remains must i do so and must i ravel out my weaved up follies gentle northumberland if thy offenses were upon record would it not shame thee in so fair a troop to read a lecture of them if thou wouldst there shouldst thou find one heinous article containing the deposing of a king and cracking the strong warrant of an oath marked with a blot damned in the book of heaven  nay all of you that stand and look upon me whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself though some of you with pilate wash your hands showing an outward pity yet you pilates have here delivered me to my sour cross and water cannot wash away your sin mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see and yet salt water blinds them not so much but they can see a sort of traitors here nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself i find myself a traitor with the rest for i have given here my soul's consent t' undeck the pompous body of a king made glory base and sovereignty a slave proud majesty a subject state a peasant no lord of thine thou haught insulting man nor no man's lord i have no name no title no not that name was given me at the font but 'tis usurped alack the heavy day that i have worn so many winters out and know not now what name to call myself o that i were a mockery king of snow standing before the sun of bolingbroke to melt myself away in water drops  good king great king and yet not greatly good an if my word be sterling yet in england let it command a mirror hither straight that it may show me what a face i have since it is bankrupt of his majesty fiend thou torments me ere i come to hell they shall be satisfied i'll read enough when i do see the very book indeed where all my sins are writ and that's myself give me that glass and therein will i read no deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck so many blows upon this face of mine and made no deeper wounds o flatt'ring glass like to my followers in prosperity thou dost beguile me was this face the face that every day under his household roof did keep ten thousand men was this the face that like the sun did make beholders wink is this the face which faced so many follies that was at last outfaced by bolingbroke a brittle glory shineth in this face as brittle as the glory is the face for there it is cracked in an hundred shivers  mark silent king the moral of this sport how soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face say that again the shadow of my sorrow ha let's see 'tis very true my grief lies all within and these external manners of laments are merely shadows to the unseen grief that swells with silence in the tortured soul there lies the substance and i thank thee king for thy great bounty that not only giv'st me cause to wail but teachest me the way how to lament the cause i'll beg one boon and then be gone and trouble you no more shall i obtain it fair cousin i am greater than a king for when i was a king my flatterers were then but subjects being now a subject i have a king here to my flatterer being so great i have no need to beg and shall i have then give me leave to go whither you will so i were from your sights o good convey conveyers are you all that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall join not with grief fair woman do not so to make my end too sudden learn good soul to think our former state a happy dream from which awaked the truth of what we are shows us but this i am sworn brother sweet to grim necessity and he and i will keep a league till death hie thee to france and cloister thee in some religious house our holy lives must win a new world's crown which our profane hours here have thrown down a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts i had been still a happy king of men good sometime queen prepare thee hence for france think i am dead and that even here thou takest as from my deathbed thy last living leave in winter's tedious nights sit by the fire with good old folks and let them tell thee tales of woeful ages long ago betid and ere thou bid good night to quite their griefs tell thou the lamentable tale of me and send the hearers weeping to their beds forwhy the senseless brands will sympathize the heavy accent of thy moving tongue and in compassion weep the fire out and some will mourn in ashes some coal black for the deposing of a rightful king northumberland thou ladder wherewithal the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne the time shall not be many hours of age more than it is ere foul sin gathering head shall break into corruption thou shalt think though he divide the realm and give thee half it is too little helping him to all he shall think that thou which knowest the way to plant unrightful kings wilt know again being ne'er so little urged another way to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne the love of wicked men converts to fear that fear to hate and hate turns one or both to worthy danger and deserv\u00e8d death doubly divorced bad men you violate a twofold marriage twixt my crown and me and then betwixt me and my married wife let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me and yet not so for with a kiss 'twas made  part us northumberland i towards the north where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime my wife to france from whence set forth in pomp she came adorn\u00e8d hither like sweet may sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart so two together weeping make one woe weep thou for me in france i for thee here better far off than near be ne'er the near go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans twice for one step i'll groan the way being short and piece the way out with a heavy heart come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief since wedding it there is such length in grief one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart we make woe wanton with this fond delay once more adieu the rest let sorrow say i have been studying how i may compare this prison where i live unto the world and for because the world is populous and here is not a creature but myself i cannot do it yet i'll hammer it out my brain i'll prove the female to my soul my soul the father and these two beget a generation of still breeding thoughts and these same thoughts people this little world in humors like the people of this world for no thought is contented the better sort as thoughts of things divine are intermixed with scruples and do set the word itself against the word as thus come little ones and then again it is as hard to come as for a camel to thread the postern of a small needle's eye thoughts tending to ambition they do plot unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails may tear a passage through the flinty ribs of this hard world my ragged prison walls and for they cannot die in their own pride thoughts tending to content flatter themselves that they are not the first of fortune's slaves nor shall not be the last like silly beggars who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame that many have and others must sit there and in this thought they find a kind of ease bearing their own misfortunes on the back of such as have before endured the like thus play i in one person many people and none contented sometimes am i king then treasons make me wish myself a beggar and so i am then crushing penury persuades me i was better when a king then am i kinged again and by and by think that i am unkinged by bolingbroke and straight am nothing but whate'er i be nor i nor any man that but man is with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased with being nothing music do i hear ha ha keep time how sour sweet music is when time is broke and no proportion kept so is it in the music of men's lives and here have i the daintiness of ear to check time broke in a disordered string but for the concord of my state and time had not an ear to hear my true time broke i wasted time and now doth time waste me for now hath time made me his numb'ring clock my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch whereto my finger like a dial's point is pointing still in cleansing them from tears now sir the sound that tells what hour it is are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans show minutes times and hours but my time runs posting on in bolingbroke's proud joy while i stand fooling here his jack of the clock this music mads me let it sound no more for though it have holp madmen to their wits in me it seems it will make wise men mad yet blessing on his heart that gives it me for 'tis a sign of love and love to richard is a strange brooch in this all hating world thanks noble peer the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear what art thou and how comest thou hither where no man never comes but that sad dog that brings me food to make misfortune live rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend how went he under him so proud that bolingbroke was on his back that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand this hand hath made him proud with clapping him would he not stumble would he not fall down since pride must have a fall and break the neck of that proud man that did usurp his back forgiveness horse why do i rail on thee since thou created to be awed by man wast born to bear i was not made a horse and yet i bear a burden like an ass spurred galled and tired by jauncing bolingbroke if thou love me 'tis time thou wert away taste of it first as thou art wont to do the devil take henry of lancaster and thee patience is stale and i am weary of it how now what means death in this rude assault villain thy own hand yields thy death's instrument go thou and fill another room in hell that hand shall burn in never quenching fire that staggers thus my person exton thy fierce hand hath with the king's blood stained the king's own land mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die", "MM_Duke": "escalus of government the properties to unfold would seem in me t' affect speech and discourse since i am put to know that your own science exceeds in that the lists of all advice my strength can give you then no more remains but that to your sufficiency as your worth is able and let them work the nature of our people our city's institutions and the terms for common justice you're as pregnant in as art and practice hath enrich\u00e8d any that we remember there is our commission from which we would not have you warp call hither i say bid come before us angelo what figure of us think you he will bear for you must know we have with special soul elected him our absence to supply lent him our terror dressed him with our love and given his deputation all the organs of our own power what think you of it look where he comes angelo there is a kind of character in thy life that to th' observer doth thy history fully unfold thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues they on thee heaven doth with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us 'twere all alike as if we had them not spirits are not finely touched but to fine issues nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines herself the glory of a creditor both thanks and use but i do bend my speech to one that can my part in him advertise hold therefore angelo in our remove be thou at full ourself mortality and mercy in vienna live in thy tongue and heart old escalus though first in question is thy secondary take thy commission no more evasion we have with a leavened and prepar\u00e8d choice proceeded to you therefore take your honors our haste from hence is of so quick condition that it prefers itself and leaves unquestioned matters of needful value we shall write to you as time and our concernings shall importune how it goes with us and do look to know what doth befall you here so fare you well to th' hopeful execution do i leave you of your commissions my haste may not admit it nor need you on mine honor have to do with any scruple your scope is as mine own so to enforce or qualify the laws as to your soul seems good give me your hand i'll privily away i love the people but do not like to stage me to their eyes though it do well i do not relish well their loud applause and aves vehement nor do i think the man of safe discretion that does affect it once more fare you well i thank you fare you well no holy father throw away that thought believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee to give me secret harbor hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth my holy sir none better knows than you how i have ever loved the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth and cost witless bravery keeps i have delivered to lord angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence my absolute power and place here in vienna and he supposes me traveled to poland for so i have strewed it in the common ear and so it is received now pious sir you will demand of me why i do this we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds which for this fourteen years we have let slip even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch only to stick it in their children's sight for terror not to use in time the rod more mocked than feared so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum i do fear too dreadful sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope 'twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment therefore indeed my father i have on angelo imposed the office who may in th' ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander and to behold his sway i will as 'twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people therefore i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear like a true friar more reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you only this one lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone hence shall we see if power change purpose what our seemers be hail to you provost so i think you are bound by my charity and my blest order i come to visit the afflicted spirits here in the prison do me the common right to let me see them and to make me know the nature of their crimes that i may minister to them accordingly when must he die repent you fair one of the sin you carry i'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience and try your penitence if it be sound or hollowly put on love you the man that wronged you so then it seems your most offenseful act was mutually committed then was your sin of heavier kind than his 'tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven showing we would not spare heaven as we love it but as we stand in fear  there rest your partner as i hear must die tomorrow and i am going with instruction to him grace go with you benedicite so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo be absolute for death either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep a breath thou art servile to all the skyey influences that doth this habitation where thou keep'st hourly afflict merely thou art death's fool for him thou labor'st by thy flight to shun and yet runn'st toward him still thou art not noble for all th' accommodations that thou bear'st are nursed by baseness thou 'rt by no means valiant for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provok'st yet grossly fear'st thy death which is no more thou art not thyself for thou exists on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou striv'st to get and what thou hast forget'st thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon if thou art rich thou 'rt poor for like an ass whose back with ingots bows thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey and death unloads thee friend hast thou none for thine own bowels which do call thee sire the mere effusion of thy proper loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an after dinner's sleep dreaming on both for all thy bless\u00e8d youth becomes as ag\u00e8d and doth beg the alms of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant what's yet in this that bears the name of life yet in this life lie hid more thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes these odds all even dear sir ere long i'll visit you again provost a word with you bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed vouchsafe a word young sister but one word might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction i would require is likewise your own benefit son i have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practice his judgment with the disposition of natures she having the truth of honor in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make ready hold you there farewell provost a word with you that now you are come you will be gone leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair the assault that angelo hath made to you fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo how will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have you not heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea she should this angelo have married was affianced to her oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was wracked at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriage dowry with both her combinate husband this well seeming angelo left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonor in few bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonor in doing it this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience this being granted in course and now follows all we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honor untainted the poor mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt if you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof what think you of it it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction i will presently to saint luke's there at the moated grange resides this dejected mariana at that place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that it may be quickly o heavens what stuff is here and you good brother father what offense hath this man made you sir fie sirrah a bawd a wicked bawd the evil that thou causest to be done that is thy means to live do thou but think what 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back from such a filthy vice say to thyself from their abominable and beastly touches i drink i eat array myself and live canst thou believe thy living is a life so stinkingly depending go mend go mend nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin thou wilt prove his take him to prison officer correction and instruction must both work ere this rude beast will profit that we were all as some would seem to be from our faults as faults from seeming free still thus and thus still worse and you i know none can you tell me of any i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well he does well in 't it is too general a vice and severity must cure it how should he be made then you are pleasant sir and speak apace i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way 'tis not possible you do him wrong surely what i prithee might be the cause wise why no question but he was either this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own bringings forth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier therefore you speak unskillfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call upon you and i pray you your name he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you o you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i can do you little harm you'll forswear this again why should he die sir no might nor greatness in mortality can censure scape back wounding calumny the whitest virtue strikes what king so strong can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue but who comes here bliss and goodness on you not of this country though my chance is now to use it for my time i am a brother of gracious order late come from the see in special business from his holiness none but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accursed much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this news is old enough yet it is every day's news i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke what pleasure was he given to he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which i by my good leisure have discredited to him and now is he resolved to die if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced himself peace be with you he who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severe pattern in himself to know grace to stand and virtue go more nor less to others paying than by self offenses weighing shame to him whose cruel striking kills for faults of his own liking twice treble shame on angelo to weed my vice and let his grow o what may man within him hide though angel on the outward side how may likeness made in crimes making practice on the times to draw with idle spiders' strings most ponderous and substantial things craft against vice i must apply with angelo tonight shall lie his old betroth\u00e8d but despis\u00e8d so disguise shall by th' disguis\u00e8d pay with falsehood false exacting and perform an old contracting 'tis good though music oft hath such a charm to make bad good and good provoke to harm i pray you tell me hath anybody inquired for me here today much upon this time have i promised here to meet i do constantly believe you the time is come even now i shall crave your forbearance a little maybe i will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself very well met and welcome what is the news from this good deputy but shall you on your knowledge find this way

this maid she comes to do you good do you persuade yourself that i respect you take then this your companion by the hand who hath a story ready for your ear i shall attend your leisure but make haste the vaporous night approaches o place and greatness millions of false eyes are stuck upon thee volumes of report run with these false and most contrarious quest upon thy doings thousand escapes of wit make thee the father of their idle dream and rack thee in their fancies welcome how agreed it is not my consent but my entreaty too nor gentle daughter fear you not at all he is your husband on a precontract to bring you thus together 'tis no sin sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit come let us go our corn's to reap for yet our tithe's to sow the best and wholesom'st spirits of the night envelop you good provost who called here of late not isabel they will then ere 't be long there's some in hope not so not so his life is paralleled even with the stroke and line of his great justice he doth with holy abstinence subdue that in himself which he spurs on his power to qualify in others were he mealed with that which he corrects then were he tyrannous but this being so he's just now are they come this is a gentle provost seldom when the steel\u00e8d jailer is the friend of men how now what noise that spirit's possessed with haste that wounds th' unsisting postern with these strokes have you no countermand for claudio yet but he must die tomorrow as near the dawning provost as it is you shall hear more ere morning and here comes claudio's pardon this is his pardon purchased by such sin for which the pardoner himself is in hence hath offense his quick celerity when it is borne in high authority when vice makes mercy mercy's so extended that for the fault's love is th' offender friended now sir what news pray you let's hear what is that barnardine who is to be executed in th' afternoon how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him i have heard it was ever his manner to do so it is now apparent hath he borne himself penitently in prison how seems he to be touched he wants advice more of him anon there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him to make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four days' respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy in the delaying death by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions may be your guide let this barnardine be this morning executed and his head borne to angelo o death's a great disguiser and you may add to it shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you

deputy you will think you have made no offense if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor

hear me speak boldly at least but o poor souls come you to seek the lamb here of the fox good night to your redress is the duke gone then is your cause gone too the duke's unjust thus to retort your manifest appeal and put your trial in the villain's mouth which here you come to accuse be not so hot the duke dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he dare rack his own his subject am i not nor here provincial my business in this state made me a looker on here in vienna where i have seen corruption boil and bubble till it o'errun the stew laws for all faults but faults so countenanced

be you as free to us your brother's death i know sits at your heart and you may marvel why i obscured myself laboring to save his life and would not rather make rash remonstrance of my hidden power

fearing death than that which lives to fear make it your comfort so happy is your brother for this new married man approaching here whose salt imagination yet hath wronged your well defended honor you must pardon for mariana's sake but as he adjudged your brother  being criminal in double violation of sacred chastity and of promise breach thereon dependent for your brother's life  the very mercy of the law cries out most audible even from his proper tongue an angelo for claudio death for death haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure like doth quit like and measure still for measure  then angelo thy fault's thus manifested which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage we do condemn thee to the very block where claudio stooped to death and with like haste  away with him it is your husband mocked you with a husband consenting to the safeguard of your honor i thought your marriage fit else imputation for that he knew you might reproach your life and choke your good to come

pray thee take this mercy to provide for better times to come friar advise him i leave him to your hand what muffled fellow's that if he be like your brother for his sake is he pardoned and for your lovely sake give me your hand and say you will be mine he is my brother too but fitter time for that by this lord angelo perceives he's safe methinks i see a quick'ning in his eye  well angelo your evil quits you well look that you love your wife her worth worth yours i find an apt remission in myself and yet here's one in place i cannot pardon you sirrah that knew me for a fool a coward one all of luxury an ass a madman wherein have i so deserved of you that you extol me thus whipped first sir and hanged after  proclaim it provost round about the city if any woman wronged by this lewd fellow

your good whereto if you'll a willing ear incline what's mine is yours and what is yours is mine  so bring us to our palace where we'll show what's yet behind that's meet you all should know", "Cor_Coriolanus": "thanks what's the matter you dissentious rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun your virtue is to make him worthy whose offense subdues him and curse that justice did it who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick man's appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil he that depends upon your favors swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes hang you trust you with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland what's the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another what's their seeking hang 'em they say they'll sit by th' fire and presume to know what's done i' th' capitol who's like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes they say there's grain enough would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword i'd make a quarry with thousands of these quartered slaves as high as i could pick my lance they are dissolved hang 'em they said they were an hungry sighed forth proverbs that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answered and a petition granted them a strange one to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look pale they threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon shouting their emulation five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice one's junius brutus sicinius velutus and i know not 'sdeath the rabble should have first unroofed the city ere so prevailed with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrection's arguing go get you home you fragments here what's the matter i am glad on 't then we shall ha' means to vent our musty superfluity see our best elders they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you to 't i sin in envying his nobility and were i anything but what i am i would wish me only he were half to half the world by th' ears and he upon my party i'd revolt to make only my wars with him he is a lion that i am proud to hunt sir it is and i am constant titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus' face what art thou stiff stand'st out nay let them follow the volsces have much corn take these rats thither to gnaw their garners worshipful mutineers your valor puts well forth pray follow yonder comes news a wager they have met 'tis done say has our general met the enemy i'll buy him of you how far off lie these armies then shall we hear their 'larum and they ours now mars i prithee make us quick in work that we with smoking swords may march from hence to help our fielded friends come blow thy blast tullus aufidius is he within your walls o they are at it they fear us not but issue forth their city  now put your shields before your hearts and fight with hearts more proof than shields advance brave titus they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts which makes me sweat with wrath come on my fellows he that retires i'll take him for a volsce and he shall feel mine edge all the contagion of the south light on you you shames of rome you herd of boils and plagues plaster you o'er that you may be abhorred farther than seen and one infect another against the wind a mile you souls of geese that bear the shapes of men how have you run from slaves that apes would beat pluto and hell all hurt behind backs red and faces pale with flight and agued fear mend and charge home or by the fires of heaven i'll leave the foe and make my wars on you look to 't come on if you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives as they us to our trenches follow 's so now the gates are ope now prove good seconds 'tis for the followers fortune widens them not for the fliers mark me and do the like see here these movers that do prize their hours at a cracked drachma cushions leaden spoons irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would bury with those that wore them these base slaves ere yet the fight be done pack up down with them and hark what noise the general makes to him there is the man of my soul's hate aufidius piercing our romans then valiant titus take convenient numbers to make good the city whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste to help cominius sir praise me not my work hath yet not warmed me fare you well the blood i drop is rather physical than dangerous to me to aufidius thus i will appear and fight thy friend no less than those she placeth highest so farewell come i too late come i too late o let me clip you in arms as sound as when i wooed in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done and tapers burnt to bedward as with a man busied about decrees condemning some to death and some to exile ransoming him or pitying threat'ning th' other holding corioles in the name of rome even like a fawning greyhound in the leash to let him slip at will let him alone he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen the common file a plague tribunes for them  the mouse ne'er shunned the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they will the time serve to tell i do not think where is the enemy are you lords o' th' field if not why cease you till you are so how lies their battle know you on which side they have placed their men of trust i do beseech you by all the battles wherein we have fought by th' blood we have shed together by th' vows we have made to endure friends that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates and that you not delay the present but filling the air with swords advanced and darts we prove this very hour those are they that most are willing if any such be here  as it were sin to doubt that love this painting wherein you see me smeared if any fear lesser his person than an ill report if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his country's dearer than himself let him alone or so many so minded wave thus to express his disposition and follow martius o me alone make you a sword of me if these shows be not outward which of you but is four volsces none of you but is able to bear against the great aufidius a shield as hard as his a certain number though thanks to all must i select from all the rest shall bear the business in some other fight as cause will be obeyed please you to march and i shall quickly draw out my command which men are best inclined i'll fight with none but thee for i do hate thee worse than a promise breaker let the first budger die the other's slave and the gods doom him after within these three hours tullus alone i fought in your corioles' walls and made what work i pleased 'tis not my blood wherein thou seest me masked for thy revenge wrench up thy power to th' highest pray now no more my mother who has a charter to extol her blood when she does praise me grieves me i have done as you have done that's what i can induced as you have been that's for my country he that has but effected his good will hath overta'en mine act i have some wounds upon me and they smart to hear themselves remembered i thank you general but cannot make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it and stand upon my common part with those that have beheld the doing may these same instruments which you profane never sound more when drums and trumpets shall i' th' field prove flatterers let courts and cities be made all of false faced soothing when steel grows soft as the parasite's silk let him be made an ovator for th' wars no more i say for that i have not washed my nose that bled or foiled some debile wretch which without note here's many else have done you shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical as if i loved my little should be dieted in praises sauced with lies i will go wash and when my face is fair you shall perceive whether i blush or no howbeit i thank you i mean to stride your steed and at all times to undercrest your good addition to th' fairness of my power the gods begin to mock me i that now refused most princely gifts am bound to beg of my lord general i sometime lay here in corioles at a poor man's house he used me kindly he cried to me i saw him prisoner but then aufidius was within my view and wrath o'erwhelmed my pity i request you to give my poor host freedom by jupiter forgot i am weary yea my memory is tired have we no wine here no more of this it does offend my heart pray now no more o you have i know petitioned all the gods for my prosperity my gracious silence hail wouldst thou have laughed had i come coffined home that weep'st to see me triumph ah my dear such eyes the widows in corioles wear and mothers that lack sons and live you yet o my sweet lady pardon menenius ever ever your hand and yours ere in our own house i do shade my head the good patricians must be visited from whom i have received not only greetings but with them change of honors know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs your honors pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them no sir yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words you soothed not therefore hurt not but your people i love them as they weigh i had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered i do owe them still my life and services i do beseech you let me o'erleap that custom for i cannot put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing it is a part that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people to brag unto them thus i did and thus show them th' unaching scars which i should hide as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only what must i say i pray sir plague upon 't i cannot bring my tongue to such a pace look sir my wounds i got them in my country's service when some certain of your brethren roared and ran from th' noise of our own drums think upon me hang 'em i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by 'em bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean so here comes a brace  you know the cause sir of my standing here mine own desert ay but not mine own desire no sir 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging well then i pray your price o' th' consulship kindly sir i pray let me ha 't i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir what say you a match sir there's in all two worthy voices begged i have your alms adieu pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown your enigma you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love i will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them 'tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practice the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you i may be consul i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther most sweet voices better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve why in this woolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that does appear their needless vouches custom calls me to 't what custom wills in all things should we do 't the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heaped for truth to o'erpeer rather than fool it so let the high office and the honor go to one that would do thus i am half through the one part suffered the other will i do here come more voices  your voices for your voices i have fought watched for your voices for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six i have seen and heard of for your voices have done many things some less some more your voices indeed i would be consul worthy voices is this done where at the senate house may i change these garments that i'll straight do and knowing myself again repair to th' senate house tullus aufidius then had made new head so then the volsces stand but as at first ready when time shall prompt them to make road upon 's again saw you aufidius spoke he of me how what at antium lives he i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully welcome home behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues o' th' common mouth i do despise them for they do prank them in authority against all noble sufferance ha what is that what makes this change have i had children's voices are these your herd must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues what are your offices you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth have you not set them on it is a purposed thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility suffer 't and live with such as cannot rule nor ever will be ruled why this was known before have you informed them sithence why then should i be consul by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune tell me of corn this was my speech and i will speak 't again now as i live i will my nobler friends i crave their pardons for the mutable rank scented meiny let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves i say again in soothing them we nourish 'gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have plowed for sowed and scattered by mingling them with us the honored number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars how no more as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tetter us yet sought the very way to catch them choler were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove 'twould be my mind shall remain hear you this triton of the minnows mark you his absolute shall shall o good but most unwise patricians why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer that with his peremptory shall being but the horn and noise o' th' monster's wants not spirit to say he'll turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity if you are learned be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the great'st taste most palates theirs they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his shall his popular shall against a graver bench than ever frowned in greece by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter 'twixt the gap of both and take the one by th' other whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o' th' storehouse gratis as 'twas used sometime in greece  though there the people had more absolute power i say they nourished disobedience fed the ruin of the state i'll give my reasons more worthier than their voices they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assured they ne'er did service for 't being pressed to th' war even when the navel of the state was touched they would not thread the gates this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis being i' th' war their mutinies and revolts wherein they showed most valor spoke not for them th' accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the native of our so frank donation well what then how shall this bosom multiplied digest the senate's courtesy let deeds express what's like to be their words we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o' th' senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles no take more what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal this double worship  where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom cannot conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance it must omit real necessities and give way the while to unstable slightness purpose so barred it follows nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you  you that will be less fearful than discreet that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change on 't that prefer a noble life before a long and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic that's sure of death without it at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue let them not lick the sweet which is their poison your dishonor mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should become 't not having the power to do the good it would for th' ill which doth control 't thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee what should the people do with these bald tribunes on whom depending their obedience fails to th' greater bench in a rebellion when what's not meet but what must be was law then were they chosen in a better hour let what is meet be said it must be meet and throw their power i' th' dust hence old goat hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones out of thy garments that is the way to lay the city flat to bring the roof to the foundation and bury all which yet distinctly ranges in heaps and piles of ruin no i'll die here there's some among you have beheld me fighting come try upon yourselves what you have seen me stand fast we have as many friends as enemies i would they were barbarians as they are though in rome littered not romans as they are not though calved i' th' porch o' th' capitol on fair ground i could beat forty of them let them pull all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight yet will i still be thus to them i muse my mother does not approve me further who was wont to call them woolen vassals things created to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads in congregations to yawn be still and wonder when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war i talk of you why did you wish me milder would you have me false to my nature rather say i play the man i am let go let them hang what must i do well what then what then for them i cannot do it to the gods must i then do 't to them tush tush why force you this must i go show them my unbarb\u00e8d sconce must i with my base tongue give to my noble heart a lie that it must bear well i will do 't yet were there but this single plot to lose this mold of martius they to dust should grind it and throw 't against the wind to th' marketplace you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to th' life well i must do 't away my disposition and possess me some harlot's spirit my throat of war be turned which choir\u00e8d with my drum into a pipe small as an eunuch or the virgin voice that babies lull asleep the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks and schoolboys' tears take up the glasses of my sight a beggar's tongue make motion through my lips and my armed knees who bowed but in my stirrup bend like his that hath received an alms i will not do 't lest i surcease to honor mine own truth and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness pray be content mother i am going to the marketplace chide me no more i'll mountebank their loves cog their hearts from them and come home beloved of all the trades in rome look i am going commend me to my wife i'll return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do i' th' way of flattery further the word is mildly pray you let us go let them accuse me by invention i will answer in mine honor well mildly be it then mildly ay as an hostler that for th' poorest piece will bear the knave by th' volume th' honored gods keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men plant love among 's throng our large temples with the shows of peace and not our streets with war first hear me speak shall i be charged no further than this present must all determine here i am content scratches with briars scars to move laughter only what is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice i am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again say then 'tis true i ought so how traitor the fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the people call me their traitor thou injurious tribune within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths in thy hands clutched as many millions in thy lying tongue both numbers i would say thou liest unto thee with a voice as free as i do pray the gods what do you prate of service you i'll know no further let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death vagabond exile flaying pent to linger but with a grain a day i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word nor check my courage for what they can give to have 't with saying good morrow you common cry of curs whose breath i hate as reek o' th' rotten fens whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air i banish you and here remain with your uncertainty let every feeble rumor shake your hearts your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair have the power still to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance which finds not till it feels making but reservation of yourselves still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows despising for you the city thus i turn my back there is a world elsewhere come leave your tears a brief farewell the beast with many heads butts me away nay mother where is your ancient courage you were used to say extremities was the trier of spirits that common chances common men could bear that when the sea was calm all boats alike showed mastership in floating fortune's blows when most struck home being gentle wounded craves a noble cunning you were used to load me with precepts that would make invincible the heart that conned them nay i prithee woman  what what what i shall be loved when i am lacked nay mother resume that spirit when you were wont to say if you had been the wife of hercules six of his labors you'd have done and saved your husband so much sweat cominius droop not adieu farewell my wife my mother i'll do well yet thou old and true menenius thy tears are salter than a younger man's and venomous to thine eyes my sometime general i have seen thee stern and thou hast oft beheld heart hard'ning spectacles tell these sad women 'tis fond to wail inevitable strokes as 'tis to laugh at 'em my mother you wot well my hazards still have been your solace and  believe 't not lightly though i go alone like to a lonely dragon that his fen makes feared and talked of more than seen your son will or exceed the common or be caught with cautelous baits and practice fare you well thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one that's yet unbruised bring me but out at gate  come my sweet wife my dearest mother and my friends of noble touch when i am forth bid me farewell and smile i pray you come while i remain above the ground you shall hear from me still and never of me aught but what is like me formerly give me thy hand come a goodly city is this antium city 'tis i that made thy widows many an heir of these fair edifices 'fore my wars have i heard groan and drop then know me not lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones in puny battle slay me save you sir direct me if it be your will where great aufidius lies is he in antium which is his house beseech you thank you sir farewell o world thy slippery turns friends now fast sworn whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart whose hours whose bed whose meal and exercise are still together who twin as 'twere in love unseparable shall within this hour on a dissension of a doit break out to bitterest enmity so fellest foes whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep to take the one the other by some chance some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends and interjoin their issues so with me my birthplace hate i and my love's upon this enemy town i'll enter if he slay me he does fair justice if he give me way i'll do his country service a goodly house the feast smells well but i appear not like a guest i have deserved no better entertainment in being coriolanus away now th' art troublesome let me but stand i will not hurt your hearth a gentleman true so i am follow your function go and batten on cold bits under the canopy ay i' th' city of kites and crows no i serve not thy master ay 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress thou prat'st and prat'st serve with thy trencher hence if tullus not yet thou know'st me and seeing me dost not think me for the man i am necessity commands me name myself a name unmusical to the volscians' ears and harsh in sound to thine prepare thy brow to frown know'st thou me yet my name is caius martius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief thereto witness may my surname coriolanus the painful service the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname a good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains the cruelty and envy of the people permitted by our dastard nobles who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest and suffered me by th' voice of slaves to be whooped out of rome now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope  mistake me not to save my life for if i had feared death of all the men i' th' world i would have 'voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight and make my misery serve thy turn so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee for i will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends but if so be thou dar'st not this and that to prove more fortunes thou 'rt tired then in a word i also am longer to live most weary and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever followed thee with hate drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee service you bless me gods what's the matter away wife mother child i know not my affairs are servanted to others though i owe my revenge properly my remission lies in volscian breasts that we have been familiar ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather than pity note how much therefore begone mine ears against your suits are stronger than your gates against my force yet for i loved thee take this along i writ it for thy sake and would have sent it another word menenius i will not hear thee speak this man aufidius was my beloved in rome yet thou behold'st we will before the walls of rome tomorrow set down our host my partner in this action you must report to th' volscian lords how plainly i have borne this business this last old man whom with a cracked heart i have sent to rome loved me above the measure of a father nay godded me indeed their latest refuge was to send him for whose old love i have  though i showed sourly to him once more offered the first conditions which they did refuse and cannot now accept to grace him only that thought he could do more a very little i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits nor from the state nor private friends hereafter will i lend ear to ha what shout is this shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time 'tis made i will not my wife comes foremost then the honored mold wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand the grandchild to her blood but out affection all bond and privilege of nature break let it be virtuous to be obstinate what is that curtsy worth or those doves' eyes which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not of stronger earth than others my mother bows as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod and my young boy hath an aspect of intercession which great nature cries deny not let the volsces plow rome and harrow italy i'll never be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin these eyes are not the same i wore in rome like a dull actor now i have forgot my part and i am out even to a full disgrace best of my flesh forgive my tyranny but do not say for that forgive our romans o a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss i carried from thee dear and my true lip hath virgined it e'er since you gods i prate and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted sink my knee i' th' earth of thy deep duty more impression show than that of common sons what's this your knees to me to your corrected son then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun murdering impossibility to make what cannot be slight work the noble sister of publicola the moon of rome chaste as the icicle that's curdied by the frost from purest snow and hangs on dian's temple dear valeria the god of soldiers with the consent of supreme jove inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove to shame unvulnerable and stick i' th' wars like a great seamark standing every flaw and saving those that eye thee that's my brave boy i beseech you peace or if you'd ask remember this before the thing i have forsworn to grant may never be held by you denials do not bid me dismiss my soldiers or capitulate again with rome's mechanics tell me not wherein i seem unnatural desire not t' allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons aufidius and you volsces mark for we'll hear naught from rome in private your request not of a woman's tenderness to be requires nor child nor woman's face to see  i have sat too long o mother mother what have you done behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at o my mother mother o you have won a happy victory to rome but for your son believe it o believe it  most dangerously you have with him prevailed if not most mortal to him but let it come  aufidius though i cannot make true wars i'll frame convenient peace now good aufidius were you in my stead would you have heard a mother less or granted less aufidius i dare be sworn you were and sir it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion but good sir what peace you'll make advise me for my part i'll not to rome i'll back with you and pray you stand to me in this cause o mother wife ay by and by but we will drink together and you shall bear a better witness back than words which we on like conditions will have countersealed come enter with us ladies you deserve to have a temple built you all the swords in italy and her confederate arms could not have made this peace hail lords i am returned your soldier no more infected with my country's love than when i parted hence but still subsisting under your great command you are to know that prosperously i have attempted and with bloody passage led your wars even to the gates of rome our spoils we have brought home doth more than counterpoise a full third part the charges of the action we have made peace with no less honor to the antiates than shame to th' romans and we here deliver subscribed by' th' consuls and patricians together with the seal o' th' senate what we have compounded on traitor how now martius hear'st thou mars ha measureless liar thou hast made my heart too great for what contains it boy o slave  pardon me lords 'tis the first time that ever i was forced to scold your judgments my grave lords must give this cur the lie and his own notion  who wears my stripes impressed upon him that must bear my beating to his grave shall join to thrust the lie unto him cut me to pieces volsces men and lads stain all your edges on me boy false hound if you have writ your annals true 'tis there that like an eagle in a dovecote i fluttered your volscians in corioles alone i did it boy o that i had him with six aufidiuses or more his tribe to use my lawful sword", "Cym_Imogen": "o dissembling courtesy how fine this tyrant can tickle where she wounds my dearest husband i something fear my father's wrath but nothing  always reserved my holy duty what his rage can do on me you must be gone and i shall here abide the hourly shot of angry eyes not comforted to live but that there is this jewel in the world that i may see again nay stay a little were you but riding forth to air yourself such parting were too petty look here love this diamond was my mother'stake it heart but keep it till you woo another wife when imogen is dead o the gods when shall we see again there cannot be a pinch in death more sharp than this is i beseech you sir harm not yourself with your vexation i am senseless of your wrath a touch more rare subdues all pangs all fears past hope and in despair that way past grace o bless\u00e8d that i might not i chose an eagle and did avoid a puttock no i rather added a luster to it sir it is your fault that i have loved posthumus you bred him as my playfellow and he is a man worth any woman overbuys me almost the sum he pays almost sir heaven restore me would i were a neatherd's daughter and my leonatus our neighbor shepherd's son your son's my father's friend he takes his part to draw upon an exile o brave sir i would they were in afric both together myself by with a needle that i might prick the goer back why came you from your master about some half hour hence pray you speak with me you shall at least go see my lord aboard for this time leave me i would thou grew'st unto the shores o' th' haven and questionedst every sail if he should write and i not have it 'twere a paper lost as offered mercy is what was the last that he spake to thee then waved his handkerchief senseless linen happier therein than i and that was all thou shouldst have made him as little as a crow or less ere left to after eye him i would have broke mine eyestrings cracked them but to look upon him till the diminution of space had pointed him sharp as my needle nay followed him till he had melted from the smallness of a gnat to air and then have turned mine eye and wept but good pisanio when shall we hear from him i did not take my leave of him but had most pretty things to say ere i could tell him how i would think on him at certain hours such thoughts and such or i could make him swear the shes of italy should not betray mine interest and his honor or have charged him at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight t' encounter me with orisons for then i am in heaven for him or ere i could give him that parting kiss which i had set betwixt two charming words comes in my father and like the tyrannous breathing of the north shakes all our buds from growing those things i bid you do get them dispatched i will attend the queen a father cruel and a stepdame false a foolish suitor to a wedded lady that hath her husband banished o that husband my supreme crown of grief and those repeated vexations of it had i been thief stol'n as my two brothers happy but most miserable is the desire that's glorious blessed be those how mean soe'er that have their honest wills which seasons comfort who may this be fie thanks good sir you're kindly welcome he is one of the noblest note to whose kindnesses i am most infinitely tied reflect upon him accordingly as you value your trust leonatus so far i read aloud but even the very middle of my heart is warmed by th' rest and takes it thankfully  you are as welcome worthy sir as i have words to bid you and shall find it so in all that i can do what makes your admiration what is the matter trow what dear sir thus raps you are you well continues well my lord his health beseech you is he disposed to mirth i hope he is when he was here he did incline to sadness and ofttimes not knowing why will my lord say so not he i hope what do you pity sir am i one sir you look on me what wrack discern you in me deserves your pity i pray you sir deliver with more openness your answers to my demands why do you pity me you do seem to know something of me or what concerns me pray you since doubting things go ill often hurts more than to be sure they do for certainties either are past remedies or timely knowing the remedy then born discover to me what both you spur and stop my lord i fear has forgot britain let me hear no more revenged how should i be revenged if this be true  as i have such a heart that both mine ears must not in haste abuse if it be true how should i be revenged what ho pisanio away i do condemn mine ears that have so long attended thee if thou wert honorable thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not for such an end thou seek'st as base as strange thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far from thy report as thou from honor and solicits here a lady that disdains thee and the devil alike what ho pisanio  the king my father shall be made acquainted of thy assault if he shall think it fit a saucy stranger in his court to mart as in a romish stew and to expound his beastly mind to us he hath a court he little cares for and a daughter who he not respects at all what ho pisanio you make amends all's well sir take my power i' th' court for yours pray what is 't willingly and pawn mine honor for their safety since my lord hath interest in them i will keep them in my bedchamber o no no i thank you for your pains but not away tomorrow i will write send your trunk to me it shall safe be kept and truly yielded you you're very welcome who's there my woman helen what hour is it i have read three hours then mine eyes are weak fold down the leaf where i have left to bed take not away the taper leave it burning and if thou canst awake by four o' th' clock i prithee call me sleep hath seized me wholly to your protection i commend me gods from fairies and the tempters of the night guard me beseech you good morrow sir you lay out too much pains for purchasing but trouble the thanks i give is telling you that i am poor of thanks and scarce can spare them if you but said so 'twere as deep with me if you swear still your recompense is still that i regard it not but that you shall not say i yield being silent i would not speak i pray you spare me faith i shall unfold equal discourtesy to your best kindness one of your great knowing should learn being taught forbearance fools are not mad folks as i am mad i do if you'll be patient i'll no more be mad that cures us both i am much sorry sir you put me to forget a lady's manners by being so verbal and learn now for all that i which know my heart do here pronounce by th' very truth of it i care not for you and am so near the lack of charity to accuse myself i hate you which i had rather you felt than make 't my boast profane fellow wert thou the son of jupiter and no more but what thou art besides thou wert too base to be his groom thou wert dignified enough even to the point of envy if 'twere made comparative for your virtues to be styled the under hangman of his kingdom and hated for being preferred so well he never can meet more mischance than come to be but named of thee his mean'st garment that ever hath but clipped his body is dearer in my respect than all the hairs above thee were they all made such men how now pisanio to dorothy my woman hie thee presently i am sprighted with a fool frighted and angered worse go bid my woman search for a jewel that too casually hath left mine arm it was thy master's shrew me if i would lose it for a revenue of any king's in europe i do think i saw 't this morning confident i am last night 'twas on mine arm i kissed it i hope it be not gone to tell my lord that i kiss aught but he i hope so go and search ay i said so sir if you will make 't an action call witness to 't your mother too she's my good lady and will conceive i hope but the worst of me so i leave you sir to th' worst of discontent how now pisanio who thy lord that is my lord leonatus o learned indeed were that astronomer that knew the stars as i his characters he'd lay the future open you good gods let what is here contained relish of love of my lord's health of his content yet not that we two are asunder let that grieve him some griefs are med'cinable that is one of them for it doth physic love of his content all but in that good wax thy leave blest be you bees that make these locks of counsel lovers and men in dangerous bonds pray not alike though forfeiters you cast in prison yet you clasp young cupid's tables good news gods justice and your father's wrath should he take me in his dominion could not be so cruel to me as you o the dearest of creatures would even renew me with your eyes take notice that i am in cambria at milford haven what your own love will out of this advise you follow so he wishes you all happiness that remains loyal to his vow and your increasing in love leonatus posthumus o for a horse with wings hear'st thou pisanio he is at milford haven read and tell me how far 'tis thither if one of mean affairs may plod it in a week why may not i glide thither in a day then true pisanio who long'st like me to see thy lord who long'st  o let me bate but not like me yet long'st but in a fainter kind o not like me for mine's beyond beyond say and speak thick  love's counselor should fill the bores of hearing to th' smothering of the sense how far it is to this same bless\u00e8d milford and by th' way tell me how wales was made so happy as t' inherit such a haven but first of all how we may steal from hence and for the gap that we shall make in time from our hence going and our return to excuse but first how get hence why should excuse be born or ere begot we'll talk of that hereafter prithee speak how many score of miles may we well rid 'twixt hour and hour why one that rode to 's execution man could never go so slow i have heard of riding wagers where horses have been nimbler than the sands that run i' th' clock's behalf but this is fool'ry go bid my woman feign a sickness say she'll home to her father and provide me presently a riding suit no costlier than would fit a franklin's huswife i see before me man nor here nor here nor what ensues but have a fog in them that i cannot look through away i prithee do as i bid thee there's no more to say accessible is none but milford way thou told'st me when we came from horse the place was near at hand ne'er longed my mother so to see me first as i have now pisanio man where is posthumus what is in thy mind that makes thee stare thus wherefore breaks that sigh from th' inward of thee one but painted thus would be interpreted a thing perplexed beyond self explication put thyself into a havior of less fear ere wildness vanquish my staider senses what's the matter why tender'st thou that paper to me with a look untender if 't be summer news smile to 't before if winterly thou need'st but keep that count'nance still my husband's hand that drug damned italy hath out craftied him and he's at some hard point speak man thy tongue may take off some extremity which to read would be even mortal to me thy mistress pisanio hath played the strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lies bleeding in me i speak not out of weak surmises but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as i expect my revenge that part thou pisanio must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers let thine own hands take away her life i shall give thee opportunity at milford haven she hath my letter for the purpose where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done thou art the pander to her dishonor and equally to me disloyal false to his bed what is it to be false to lie in watch there and to think on him to weep 'twixt clock and clock if sleep charge nature to break it with a fearful dream of him and cry myself awake that's false to 's bed is it i false thy conscience witness iachimo thou didst accuse him of incontinency thou then looked'st like a villain now methinks thy favor's good enough some jay of italy whose mother was her painting hath betrayed him poor i am stale a garment out of fashion and for i am richer than to hang by th' walls i must be ripped to pieces with me o men's vows are women's traitors all good seeming by thy revolt o husband shall be thought put on for villainy not born where 't grows but worn a bait for ladies true honest men being heard like false aeneas were in his time thought false and sinon's weeping did scandal many a holy tear took pity from most true wretchedness so thou posthumus wilt lay the leaven on all proper men goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured from thy great fail come fellow be thou honest do thou thy master's bidding when thou seest him a little witness my obedience look i draw the sword myself take it and hit the innocent mansion of my love my heart fear not 'tis empty of all things but grief thy master is not there who was indeed the riches of it do his bidding strike thou mayst be valiant in a better cause but now thou seem'st a coward why i must die and if i do not by thy hand thou art no servant of thy master's against self slaughter there is a prohibition so divine that cravens my weak hand come here's my heart  something's afore 't soft soft we'll no defense  obedient as the scabbard what is here the scriptures of the loyal leonatus all turned to heresy away away corrupters of my faith you shall no more be stomachers to my heart thus may poor fools believe false teachers though those that are betrayed do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor stands in worse case of woe and thou posthumus that didst set up my disobedience 'gainst the king my father and make me put into contempt the suits of princely fellows shalt hereafter find it is no act of common passage but a strain of rareness and i grieve myself to think when thou shalt be disedged by her that now thou tirest on how thy memory will then be panged by me prithee dispatch the lamb entreats the butcher where's thy knife thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding when i desire it too do 't and to bed then wherefore then didst undertake it why hast thou abused so many miles with a pretense this place mine action and thine own our horses' labor the time inviting thee the perturbed court for my being absent whereunto i never purpose return why hast thou gone so far to be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand th' elected deer before thee talk thy tongue weary speak i have heard i am a strumpet and

still questioned me the story of my life from year to year the battles sieges fortunes that i have passed i ran it through even from my boyish days to th' very moment that he bade me tell it wherein i spoke of most disastrous chances of moving accidents by flood and field of hairbreadth 'scapes i' th' imminent deadly breach of being taken by the insolent foe and sold to slavery of my redemption thence and portance in my traveler's history wherein of antres vast and deserts idle rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven it was my hint to speak such was my process  and of the cannibals that each other eat the anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders these things to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the house affairs would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch she'd come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcels she had something heard but not intentively i did consent and often did beguile her of her tears when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffered my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sighs she swore in faith 'twas strange 'twas passing strange 'twas pitiful 'twas wondrous pitiful she wished she had not heard it yet she wished that heaven had made her such a man she thanked me and bade me if i had a friend that loved her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her upon this hint i spake she loved me for the dangers i had passed and i loved her that she did pity them this only is the witchcraft i have used here comes the lady let her witness it the tyrant custom most grave senators hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my thrice driven bed of down i do agnize a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness and do undertake this present

that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a night brawler give me answer to it now by heaven my blood begins my safer guides to rule and passion having my best judgment collied assays to lead the way zounds if i stir or do but lift this arm the best of you shall sink in my rebuke give me to know how this foul rout began who set it on and he that is approved in this offense though he had twinned with me both at a birth shall lose me what in a town of war yet wild the people's hearts brimful of fear to manage private and domestic quarrel in night and on the court and guard of safety 'tis monstrous iago who began 't i know iago thy honesty and love doth mince this matter making it light to cassio cassio i love thee but nevermore be officer of mine look if my gentle love be not raised up i'll make thee an example all's well now sweeting come away to bed sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon lead him off iago look with care about the town and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted  come desdemona 'tis the soldier's life to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife these letters give iago to the pilot and by him do my duties to the senate that done i will be walking on the works repair there to me this fortification gentlemen shall we see 't what dost thou say was not that cassio parted from my wife i do believe 'twas he who is 't you mean went he hence now not now sweet desdemon some other time the sooner sweet for you no not tonight i shall not dine at home i meet the captains at the citadel prithee no more let him come when he will i will deny thee nothing i will deny thee nothing whereon i do beseech thee grant me this to leave me but a little to myself farewell my desdemona i'll come to thee straight excellent wretch perdition catch my soul but i do love thee and when i love thee not chaos is come again what dost thou say iago he did from first to last why dost thou ask why of thy thought iago o yes and went between us very oft indeed ay indeed discern'st thou aught in that is he not honest honest ay honest what dost thou think think my lord by heaven thou echo'st me as if there were some monster in thy thought too hideous to be shown thou dost mean something i heard thee say even now thou lik'st not that when cassio left my wife what didst not like and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing thou cried'st indeed and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit if thou dost love me show me thy thought i think thou dost and for i know thou 'rt full of love and honesty and weigh'st thy words before thou giv'st them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom but in a man that's just they're close dilations working from the heart that passion cannot rule i think so too certain men should be what they seem nay yet there's more in this i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words thou dost conspire against thy friend iago if thou but think'st him wronged and mak'st his ear a stranger to thy thoughts what dost thou mean by heaven i'll know thy thoughts ha o misery why why is this think'st thou i'd make a life of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises matching thy inference 'tis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are more virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me no iago i'll see before i doubt when i doubt prove and on the proof there is no more but this away at once with love or jealousy dost thou say so and so she did i am bound to thee forever not a jot not a jot i will not no not much moved i do not think but desdemona's honest and yet how nature erring from itself  farewell farewell if more thou dost perceive let me know more set on thy wife to observe leave me iago why did i marry this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more much more than he unfolds fear not my government this fellow's of exceeding honesty and knows all qualities with a learn\u00e8d spirit of human dealings if i do prove her haggard though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings i'd whistle her off and let her down the wind to prey at fortune haply for i am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have or for i am declined into the vale of years yet that's not much  she's gone i am abused and my relief must be to loathe her o curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapor of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others' uses yet 'tis the plague of great ones prerogatived are they less than the base 'tis destiny unshunnable like death even then this fork\u00e8d plague is fated to us when we do quicken look where she comes if she be false heaven mocks itself i'll not believe 't i am to blame i have a pain upon my forehead here your napkin is too little let it alone come i'll go in with you ha ha false to me avaunt begone thou hast set me on the rack i swear 'tis better to be much abused than but to know 't a little what sense had i of her stol'n hours of lust i saw 't not thought it not it harmed not me i slept the next night well fed well was free and merry i found not cassio's kisses on her lips he that is robbed not wanting what is stol'n let him not know 't and he's not robbed at all i had been happy if the general camp pioners and all had tasted her sweet body so i had nothing known o now forever farewell the tranquil mind farewell content farewell the plum\u00e8d troops and the big wars that makes ambition virtue o farewell farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spirit stirring drum th' ear piercing fife the royal banner and all quality pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war and o you mortal engines whose rude throats th' immortal jove's dread clamors counterfeit farewell othello's occupation's gone villain be sure thou prove my love a whore be sure of it give me the ocular proof or by the worth of mine eternal soul thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my waked wrath make me to see 't or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life if thou dost slander her and torture me never pray more abandon all remorse on horror's head horrors accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that nay stay thou shouldst be honest by the world i think my wife be honest and think she is not i think that thou art just and think thou art not i'll have some proof her name that was as fresh as dian's visage is now begrimed and black as mine own face if there be cords or knives poison or fire or suffocating streams i'll not endure it would i were satisfied would nay and i will death and damnation o give me a living reason she's disloyal o monstrous monstrous but this denoted a foregone conclusion 'tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream i'll tear her all to pieces i gave her such a one 'twas my first gift if it be that  o that the slave had forty thousand lives one is too poor too weak for my revenge now do i see 'tis true look here iago all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven 'tis gone arise black vengeance from the hollow hell yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught for 'tis of aspics' tongues o blood blood blood never iago like to the pontic sea whose icy current and compulsive course ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on to the propontic and the hellespont even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them up now by yond marble heaven in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words i greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous and will upon the instant put thee to 't within these three days let me hear thee say that cassio's not alive damn her lewd minx o damn her damn her come go with me apart i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil now art thou my lieutenant well my good lady o hardness to dissemble  how do you desdemona give me your hand this hand is moist my lady this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer much castigation exercise devout for here's a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels 'tis a good hand a frank one a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands but our new heraldry is hands not hearts what promise chuck i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me lend me thy handkerchief that which i gave you not that's a fault that handkerchief did an egyptian to my mother give she was a charmer and could almost read the thoughts of people she told her while she kept it 'twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love but if she lost it or made a gift of it my father's eye should hold her loath\u00e8d and his spirits should hunt after new fancies she dying gave it me and bid me when my fate would have me wived to give it her i did so and take heed on 't make it a darling like your precious eye to lose 't or give 't away were such perdition as nothing else could match 'tis true there's magic in the web of it a sybil that had numbered in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses in her prophetic fury sewed the work the worms were hallowed that did breed the silk and it was dyed in mummy which the skillful conserved of maidens' hearts most veritable therefore look to 't well ha wherefore is 't lost is 't gone speak is 't out o' th' way say you how fetch 't let me see 't fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives the handkerchief the handkerchief the handkerchief

passion without some instruction it is not words that shakes me thus pish noses ears and lips is 't possible confess handkerchief o devil dost thou mock me a horn\u00e8d man's a monster and a beast did he confess it o thou art wise 'tis certain dost thou hear iago i will be found most cunning in my patience but dost thou hear most bloody look how he laughs already now he denies it faintly and laughs it out now he importunes him to tell it o'er go to well said well said do you triumph roman do you triumph so so so so they laugh that wins have you scored me well iago beckons me now he begins

in poverty to the very lips given to captivity me and my utmost hopes i should have found in some place of my soul a drop of patience but alas to make me a fix\u00e8d figure for the time of scorn to point his slow unmoving finger at  yet could i bear that too well very well but there where i have garnered up my heart where either i must live or bear no life the fountain from the which my current runs or else dries up to be discarded thence or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in turn thy complexion there patience thou young and rose lipped cherubin ay there look grim as hell o ay as summer flies are in the shambles that quicken even with blowing o thou weed who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst ne'er been born was this fair paper this most goodly book made to write whore upon what committed committed o thou public commoner i should make very forges of my cheeks that would to cinders burn up modesty did i but speak thy deeds what committed heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets is hushed within the hollow mine of earth and will not hear 't what committed

thine eyes are blotted thy bed lust stained shall with lust's blood be spotted it is the cause it is the cause my soul let me not name it to you you chaste stars it is the cause yet i'll not shed her blood nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow and smooth as monumental alabaster yet she must die else she'll betray more men put out the light and then put out the light if i quench thee thou flaming minister i can again thy former light restore should i repent me but once put out thy light thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature i know not where is that promethean heat that can thy light relume when i have plucked the rose i cannot give it vital growth again it needs must wither i'll smell it on the tree o balmy breath that dost almost persuade justice to break her sword one more one more be thus when thou art dead and i will kill thee and love thee after one more and this the last so sweet was ne'er so fatal i must weep but they are cruel tears this sorrow's heavenly it strikes where it doth love she wakes ay desdemona have you prayed tonight desdemon if you bethink yourself of any crime unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace solicit for it straight well do it and

sir the king your father was reputed for a prince most prudent of an excellent and unmatched wit and judgment ferdinand my father king of spain was reckoned one the wisest prince that there had reigned by many a year before it is not to be questioned that they had gathered a wise council to them of every realm that did debate this business who deemed our marriage lawful wherefore i humbly beseech you sir to spare me till i may be by my friends in spain advised whose counsel i will implore if not i' th' name of god your pleasure be fulfilled lord cardinal to you i speak sir i am about to weep but thinking that we are a queen or long have dreamed so certain the daughter of a king my drops of tears i'll turn to sparks of fire i will when you are humble nay before or god will punish me i do believe induced by potent circumstances that you are mine enemy and make my challenge you shall not be my judge for it is you have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me  which god's dew quench therefore i say again i utterly abhor yea from my soul refuse you for my judge whom yet once more i hold my most malicious foe and think not at all a friend to truth my lord my lord i am a simple woman much too weak t' oppose your cunning you're meek and humble mouthed you sign your place and calling in full seeming with meekness and humility but your heart is crammed with arrogancy spleen and pride you have by fortune and his highness' favors gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted where powers are your retainers and your words domestics to you serve your will as 't please yourself pronounce their office i must tell you you tender more your person's honor than your high profession spiritual that again i do refuse you for my judge and here before you all appeal unto the pope to bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness and to be judged by him what need you note it pray you keep your way when you are called return now the lord help they vex me past my patience

should be good men their affairs as righteous but all hoods make not monks your graces find me here part of a housewife i would be all against the worst may happen what are your pleasures with me reverend lords speak it here there's nothing i have done yet o' my conscience deserves a corner would all other women could speak this with as free a soul as i do my lords i care not so much i am happy above a number if my actions were tried by ev'ry tongue ev'ry eye saw 'em envy and base opinion set against 'em i know my life so even if your business seek me out and that way i am wife in out with it boldly truth loves open dealing o good my lord no latin i am not such a truant since my coming as not to know the language i have lived in a strange tongue makes my cause more strange suspicious pray speak in english here are some will thank you if you speak truth for their poor mistress' sake believe me she has had much wrong lord cardinal the willing'st sin i ever yet committed may be absolved in english to betray me  my lords i thank you both for your good wills you speak like honest men pray god you prove so but how to make you suddenly an answer in such a point of weight so near mine honor  more near my life i fear with my weak wit and to such men of gravity and learning in truth i know not i was set at work among my maids full little god knows looking either for such men or such business for her sake that i have been for i feel the last fit of my greatness good your graces let me have time and counsel for my cause alas i am a woman friendless hopeless in england but little for my profit can you think lords that any englishman dare give me counsel or be a known friend 'gainst his highness' pleasure though he be grown so desperate to be honest and live a subject nay forsooth my friends they that must weigh out my afflictions they that my trust must grow to live not here they are as all my other comforts far hence in mine own country lords how sir you tell me what you wish for both my ruin is this your christian counsel out upon you heaven is above all yet there sits a judge that no king can corrupt the more shame for you holy men i thought you upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues but cardinal sins and hollow hearts i fear you mend 'em for shame my lords is this your comfort the cordial that you bring a wretched lady a woman lost among you laughed at scorned i will not wish you half my miseries i have more charity but say i warned you take heed for heaven's sake take heed lest at once the burden of my sorrows fall upon you you turn me into nothing woe upon you and all such false professors would you have me  if you have any justice any pity if you be anything but churchmen's habits  put my sick cause into his hands that hates me alas has banished me his bed already his love too long ago i am old my lords and all the fellowship i hold now with him is only my obedience what can happen to me above this wretchedness all your studies make me a curse like this have i lived thus long let me speak myself since virtue finds no friends a wife a true one  a woman i dare say without vainglory never yet branded with suspicion  have i with all my full affections still met the king loved him next heav'n obeyed him been out of fondness superstitious to him almost forgot my prayers to content him and am i thus rewarded 'tis not well lords bring me a constant woman to her husband one that ne'er dreamed a joy beyond his pleasure and to that woman when she has done most yet will i add an honor a great patience my lord i dare not make myself so guilty to give up willingly that noble title your master wed me to nothing but death shall e'er divorce my dignities would i had never trod this english earth or felt the flatteries that grow upon it you have angels' faces but heaven knows your hearts what will become of me now wretched lady i am the most unhappy woman living alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes shipwracked upon a kingdom where no pity no friends no hope no kindred weep for me almost no grave allowed me like the lily that once was mistress of the field and flourished i'll hang my head and perish do what you will my lords and pray forgive me if i have used myself unmannerly you know i am a woman lacking wit to make a seemly answer to such persons pray do my service to his majesty he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers while i shall have my life come reverend fathers bestow your counsels on me she now begs that little thought when she set footing here she should have bought her dignities so dear o griffith sick to death my legs like loaden branches bow to th' earth willing to leave their burden reach a chair so now methinks i feel a little ease didst thou not tell me griffith as thou ledst me that the great child of honor cardinal wolsey was dead prithee good griffith tell me how he died if well he stepped before me happily for my example alas poor man so may he rest his faults lie gently on him yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him and yet with charity he was a man of an unbounded stomach ever ranking himself with princes one that by suggestion tied all the kingdom simony was fair play his own opinion was his law i' th' presence he would say untruths and be ever double both in his words and meaning he was never but where he meant to ruin pitiful his promises were as he then was mighty but his performance as he is now nothing of his own body he was ill and gave the clergy ill example yes good griffith i were malicious else after my death i wish no other herald no other speaker of my living actions to keep mine honor from corruption but such an honest chronicler as griffith whom i most hated living thou hast made me with thy religious truth and modesty now in his ashes honor peace be with him  patience be near me still and set me lower i have not long to trouble thee good griffith cause the musicians play me that sad note i named my knell whilst i sit meditating on that celestial harmony i go to spirits of peace where are you are you all gone and leave me here in wretchedness behind you it is not you i call for saw you none enter since i slept no saw you not even now a blessed troop invite me to a banquet whose bright faces cast thousand beams upon me like the sun they promised me eternal happiness and brought me garlands griffith which i feel i am not worthy yet to wear i shall assuredly bid the music leave they are harsh and heavy to me you are a saucy fellow deserve we no more reverence admit him entrance griffith but this fellow let me ne'er see again if my sight fail not you should be lord ambassador from the emperor my royal nephew and your name capuchius o my lord the times and titles now are altered strangely with me since first you knew me but i pray you what is your pleasure with me o my good lord that comfort comes too late 'tis like a pardon after execution that gentle physic given in time had cured me but now i am past all comforts here but prayers how does his highness so may he ever do and ever flourish when i shall dwell with worms and my poor name banished the kingdom patience is that letter i caused you write yet sent away sir i most humbly pray you to deliver this to my lord the king  in which i have commended to his goodness the model of our chaste loves his young daughter  the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her  beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding  she is young and of a noble modest nature i hope she will deserve well and a little to love her for her mother's sake that loved him heaven knows how dearly my next poor petition is that his noble grace would have some pity upon my wretched women that so long have followed both my fortunes faithfully of which there is not one i dare avow  and now i should not lie but will deserve for virtue and true beauty of the soul for honesty and decent carriage a right good husband let him be a noble and sure those men are happy that shall have 'em the last is for my men they are the poorest but poverty could never draw 'em from me  that they may have their wages duly paid 'em and something over to remember me by if heaven had pleased to have given me longer life and able means we had not parted thus these are the whole contents and good my lord by that you love the dearest in this world as you wish christian peace to souls departed stand these poor people's friend and urge the king to do me this last right i thank you honest lord remember me in all humility unto his highness say his long trouble now is passing out of this world tell him in death i blessed him for so i will mine eyes grow dim farewell my lord griffith farewell nay patience you must not leave me yet i must to bed call in more women when i am dead good wench let me be used with honor strew me over with maiden flowers that all the world may know i was a chaste wife to my grave embalm me then lay me forth

sicilia is a so forth 'tis far gone when i shall gust it last how came 't camillo that he did stay at the queen's be 't good should be pertinent but so it is it is not was this taken by any understanding pate but thine for thy conceit is soaking will draw in more than the common blocks not noted is 't but of the finer natures by some severals of headpiece extraordinary lower messes perchance are to this business purblind say ha ay but why satisfy th' entreaties of your mistress satisfy let that suffice i have trusted thee camillo with all the nearest things to my heart as well my chamber counsels wherein priestlike thou hast cleansed my bosom i from thee departed thy penitent reformed but we have been deceived in thy integrity deceived in that which seems so to bide upon 't thou art not honest or if thou inclin'st that way thou art a coward which hoxes honesty behind restraining from course required or else thou must be counted a servant grafted in my serious trust and therein negligent or else a fool that seest a game played home the rich stake drawn and tak'st it all for jest ha' not you seen camillo  but that's past doubt you have or your eyeglass is thicker than a cuckold's horn or heard  for to a vision so apparent rumor cannot be mute or thought for cogitation resides not in that man that does not think  my wife is slippery if thou wilt confess  or else be impudently negative to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say my wife's a hobby horse deserves a name as rank as any flax wench that puts to before her troth plight say 't and justify 't is

that's in 't is nothing the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing my wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings if this be nothing say it be 'tis true it is you lie you lie i say thou liest camillo and i hate thee pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave or else a hovering temporizer that canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil inclining to them both were my wife's liver infected as her life she would not live the running of one glass why he that wears her like her medal hanging about his neck bohemia who if i had servants true about me that bare eyes to see alike mine honor as their profits their own particular thrifts they would do that which should undo more doing ay and thou his cupbearer whom i from meaner form have benched and reared to worship who mayst see plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven how i am galled mightst bespice a cup to give mine enemy a lasting wink which draft to me were cordial make that thy question and go rot dost think i am so muddy so unsettled to appoint myself in this vexation sully the purity and whiteness of my sheets  which to preserve is sleep which being spotted is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps  give scandal to the blood o' th' prince my son who i do think is mine and love as mine without ripe moving to 't would i do this could man so blench thou dost advise me even so as i mine own course have set down i'll give no blemish to her honor none this is all do 't and thou hast the one half of my heart do 't not thou splitt'st thine own i will seem friendly as thou hast advised me was he met there his train camillo with him how blest am i in my just censure in my true opinion alack for lesser knowledge how accursed in being so blest there may be in the cup a spider steeped and one may drink depart and yet partake no venom for his knowledge is not infected but if one present th' abhorred ingredient to his eye make known how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides with violent hefts i have drunk and seen the spider camillo was his help in this his pander there is a plot against my life my crown all's true that is mistrusted that false villain whom i employed was pre employed by him he has discovered my design and i remain a pinched thing yea a very trick for them to play at will how came the posterns so easily open i know 't too well give me the boy i am glad you did not nurse him though he does bear some signs of me yet you have too much blood in him bear the boy hence he shall not come about her away with him and let her sport herself with that she's big with for 'tis polixenes has made thee swell thus you my lords look on her mark her well be but about to say she is a goodly lady and the justice of your hearts will thereto add 'tis pity she's not honest honorable praise her but for this her without door form which on my faith deserves high speech and straight the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands that calumny doth use o i am out that mercy does for calumny will sear virtue itself these shrugs these s and s when you have said she's goodly come between ere you can say she's honest but be 't known from him that has most cause to grieve it should be she's an adult'ress you have mistook my lady polixenes for leontes o thou thing which i'll not call a creature of thy place lest barbarism making me the precedent should a like language use to all degrees and mannerly distinguishment leave out betwixt the prince and beggar i have said she's an adult'ress i have said with whom more she's a traitor and camillo is a federary with her and one that knows what she should shame to know herself but with her most vile principal that she's a bed swerver even as bad as those that vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy to this their late escape no if i mistake in those foundations which i build upon the center is not big enough to bear a schoolboy's top away with her to prison he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty but that he speaks shall i be heard go do our bidding hence hold your peaces cease no more you smell this business with a sense as cold as is a dead man's nose but i do see 't and feel 't as you feel doing thus and see withal the instruments that feel what lack i credit why what need we commune with you of this but rather follow our forceful instigation our prerogative calls not your counsels but our natural goodness imparts this which if you or stupefied or seeming so in skill cannot or will not relish a truth like us inform yourselves we need no more of your advice the matter the loss the gain the ord'ring on 't is all properly ours how could that be either thou art most ignorant by age or thou wert born a fool camillo's flight added to their familiarity  which was as gross as ever touched conjecture that lacked sight only naught for approbation but only seeing all other circumstances made up to th' deed doth push on this proceeding yet for a greater confirmation  for in an act of this importance 'twere most piteous to be wild i have dispatched in post to sacred delphos to apollo's temple cleomenes and dion whom you know of stuffed sufficiency now from the oracle they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had shall stop or spur me have i done well though i am satisfied and need no more than what i know yet shall the oracle give rest to th' minds of others such as he whose ignorant credulity will not come up to th' truth so have we thought it good from our free person she should be confined lest that the treachery of the two fled hence be left her to perform come follow us we are to speak in public for this business will raise us all nor night nor day no rest it is but weakness to bear the matter thus mere weakness if the cause were not in being part o' th' cause she th' adult'ress for the harlot king is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank and level of my brain plot proof but she i can hook to me say that she were gone given to the fire a moiety of my rest might come to me again who's there how does the boy to see his nobleness conceiving the dishonor of his mother he straight declined drooped took it deeply fastened and fixed the shame on 't in himself threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep and downright languished leave me solely go see how he fares fie fie no thought of him the very thought of my revenges that way recoil upon me in himself too mighty and in his parties his alliance let him be until a time may serve for present vengeance take it on her camillo and polixenes laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow they should not laugh if i could reach them nor shall she within my power what noise there ho how  away with that audacious lady antigonus i charged thee that she should not come about me i knew she would what canst not rule her good queen force her hence out a mankind witch hence with her out o' door a most intelligencing bawd traitors will you not push her out give her the bastard thou dotard thou art woman tired unroosted by thy dame partlet here take up the bastard take 't up i say give 't to thy crone he dreads his wife a nest of traitors a callet of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband and now baits me this brat is none of mine it is the issue of polixenes hence with it and together with the dam commit them to the fire a gross hag  and losel thou art worthy to be hanged that wilt not stay her tongue once more take her hence i'll ha' thee burnt on your allegiance out of the chamber with her were i a tyrant where were her life she durst not call me so if she did know me one away with her thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this my child away with 't even thou that hast a heart so tender o'er it take it hence and see it instantly consumed with fire even thou and none but thou take it up straight within this hour bring me word 'tis done and by good testimony or i'll seize thy life with what thou else call'st thine if thou refuse and wilt encounter with my wrath say so the bastard brains with these my proper hands shall i dash out go take it to the fire for thou sett'st on thy wife you're liars all i am a feather for each wind that blows shall i live on to see this bastard kneel and call me father better burn it now than curse it then but be it let it live it shall not neither you sir come you hither you that have been so tenderly officious with lady margery your midwife there to save this bastard's life for 'tis a bastard so sure as this beard's gray what will you adventure to save this brat's life it shall be possible swear by this sword thou wilt perform my bidding mark and perform it seest thou for the fail of any point in 't shall not only be death to thyself but to thy lewd tongued wife whom for this time we pardon we enjoin thee as thou art liegeman to us that thou carry this female bastard hence and that thou bear it to some remote and desert place quite out of our dominions and that there thou leave it without more mercy to it own protection and favor of the climate as by strange fortune it came to us i do in justice charge thee on thy soul's peril and thy body's torture that thou commend it strangely to some place where chance may nurse or end it take it up no i'll not rear another's issue twenty three days they have been absent 'tis good speed foretells the great apollo suddenly will have the truth of this appear prepare you lords summon a session that we may arraign our most disloyal lady for as she hath been publicly accused so shall she have a just and open trial while she lives my heart will be a burden to me leave me and think upon my bidding this sessions to our great grief we pronounce even pushes 'gainst our heart the party tried the daughter of a king our wife and one of us too much beloved let us be cleared of being tyrannous since we so openly proceed in justice which shall have due course even to the guilt or the purgation produce the prisoner read the indictment i ne'er heard yet that any of these bolder vices wanted less impudence to gainsay what they did than to perform it first you will not own it you knew of his departure as you know what you have underta'en to do in 's absence your actions are my dreams you had a bastard by polixenes and i but dreamed it as you were past all shame  those of your fact are so so past all truth which to deny concerns more than avails for as thy brat hath been cast out like to itself no father owning it which is indeed more criminal in thee than it so thou shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage look for no less than death break up the seals and read hast thou read truth there is no truth at all i' th' oracle the sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood what is the business how gone apollo's angry and the heavens themselves do strike at my injustice how now there take her hence her heart is but o'ercharged she will recover i have too much believed mine own suspicion beseech you tenderly apply to her some remedies for life apollo pardon my great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle i'll reconcile me to polixenes new woo my queen recall the good camillo whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy for being transported by my jealousies to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose camillo for the minister to poison my friend polixenes which had been done but that the good mind of camillo tardied my swift command though i with death and with reward did threaten and encourage him not doing it and being done he most humane and filled with honor to my kingly guest unclasped my practice quit his fortunes here which you knew great and to the hazard of all incertainties himself commended no richer than his honor how he glisters through my rust and how his piety does my deeds make the blacker go on go on thou canst not speak too much i have deserved all tongues to talk their bitt'rest thou didst speak but well when most the truth which i receive much better than to be pitied of thee prithee bring me to the dead bodies of my queen and son one grave shall be for both upon them shall the causes of their death appear unto our shame perpetual once a day i'll visit the chapel where they lie and tears shed there shall be my recreation so long as nature will bear up with this exercise so long i daily vow to use it come and lead me to these sorrows whilst i remember her and her virtues i cannot forget my blemishes in them and so still think of the wrong i did myself which was so much that heirless it hath made my kingdom and destroyed the sweet'st companion that e'er man bred his hopes out of i think so killed she i killed i did so but thou strik'st me sorely to say i did it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now say so but seldom good paulina who hast the memory of hermione i know in honor o that ever i had squared me to thy counsel then even now i might have looked upon my queen's full eyes have taken treasure from her lips  thou speak'st truth no more such wives therefore no wife one worse and better used would make her sainted spirit again possess her corpse and on this stage where we offenders now appear soul vexed and begin why to me she had and would incense me to murder her i married stars stars and all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wife i'll have no wife paulina never paulina so be blest my spirit my true paulina we shall not marry till thou bid'st us what with him he comes not like to his father's greatness his approach so out of circumstance and sudden tells us 'tis not a visitation framed but forced by need and accident what train his princess say you with him go cleomenes yourself assisted with your honored friends bring them to our embracement still 'tis strange he thus should steal upon us prithee no more cease thou know'st he dies to me again when talked of sure when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches will bring me to consider that which may unfurnish me of reason they are come your mother was most true to wedlock prince for she did print your royal father off conceiving you were i but twenty one your father's image is so hit in you his very air that i should call you brother as i did him and speak of something wildly by us performed before most dearly welcome and your fair princess goddess o alas i lost a couple that 'twixt heaven and earth might thus have stood begetting wonder as you gracious couple do and then i lost  all mine own folly the society amity too of your brave father whom though bearing misery i desire my life once more to look on him o my brother good gentleman the wrongs i have done thee stir afresh within me and these thy offices so rarely kind are as interpreters of my behindhand slackness welcome hither as is the spring to th' earth and hath he too exposed this paragon to th' fearful usage at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune to greet a man not worth her pains much less th' adventure of her person where the warlike smalus that noble honored lord is feared and loved the bless\u00e8d gods purge all infection from our air whilst you do climate here you have a holy father a graceful gentleman against whose person so sacred as it is i have done sin for which the heavens taking angry note have left me issueless and your father's blest as he from heaven merits it with you worthy his goodness what might i have been might i a son and daughter now have looked on such goodly things as you where's bohemia speak who camillo you are married my lord is this the daughter of a king that once i see by your good father's speed will come on very slowly i am sorry most sorry you have broken from his liking where you were tied in duty and as sorry your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty that you might well enjoy her would he do so i'd beg your precious mistress which he counts but a trifle i thought of her even in these looks i made but your petition is yet unanswered i will to your father your honor not o'erthrown by your desires i am friend to them and you upon which errand i now go toward him therefore follow me and mark what way i make come good my lord o grave and good paulina the great comfort that i have had of thee o paulina we honor you with

bound for life and education my life and education both do learn me how to respect you you are the lord of duty i am hitherto your daughter but here's my husband and so much duty as my mother showed to you preferring you before her father so much i challenge that i may profess due to the moor my lord nor would i there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye most gracious duke to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice t' assist my simpleness that i love the moor to live with him my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world my heart's subdued even to the very quality of my lord i saw othello's visage in his mind and to his honors and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate so that dear lords if i be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the war the rites for why i love him are bereft me and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence let me go with him i thank you valiant cassio what tidings can you tell of my lord o but i fear how lost you company alas she has no speech oh fie upon thee slanderer what wouldst write of me if thou shouldst praise me come on assay there's one gone to the harbor i am not merry but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise  come how wouldst thou praise me well praised how if she be black and witty worse and worse these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' th' alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself to do what o most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn of him emilia though he be thy husband how say you cassio is he not a most profane and liberal counselor let's meet him and receive him my dear othello the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase even as our days do grow what is the matter dear be thou assured good cassio i will do all my abilities in thy behalf o that's an honest fellow do not doubt cassio but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were i know 't i thank you you do love my lord you have known him long and be you well assured he shall in strangeness stand no farther off than in a politic distance do not doubt that before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee if i do vow a friendship i'll perform it to the last article my lord shall never rest i'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift i'll intermingle everything he does with cassio's suit therefore be merry cassio for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away why stay and hear me speak well do your discretion how now my lord i have been talking with a suitor here a man that languishes in your displeasure why your lieutenant cassio good my lord if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take for if he be not one that truly loves you that errs in ignorance and not in cunning i have no judgment in an honest face i prithee call him back yes faith so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him good love call him back but shall 't be shortly shall 't be tonight at supper tomorrow dinner then why then tomorrow night or tuesday morn on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn i prithee name the time but let it not exceed three days in faith he's penitent and yet his trespass in our common reason  save that they say the wars must make example out of her best is not almost a fault t' incur a private check when shall he come tell me othello i wonder in my soul what you would ask me that i should deny or stand so mamm'ring on what michael cassio that came a wooing with you and so many a time when i have spoke of you dispraisingly hath ta'en your part to have so much to do to bring him in by 'r lady i could do much  why this is not a boon 'tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person nay when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted shall i deny you no farewell my lord emilia come be as your fancies teach you whate'er you be i am obedient how now my dear othello your dinner and the generous islanders by you invited do attend your presence why do you speak so faintly are you not well faith that's with watching 'twill away again let me but bind it hard within this hour it will be well i am very sorry that you are not well do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies why man go to where lodges he can anything be made of this can you inquire him out and be edified by report seek him bid him come hither tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well where should i lose that handkerchief emilia believe me i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are it were enough to put him to ill thinking who he i think the sun where he was born drew all such humors from him i will not leave him now till cassio be called to him how is 't with you my lord well my good lord it yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow you may indeed say so for 'twas that hand that gave away my heart i cannot speak of this come now your promise i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you here my lord i have it not about me no faith my lord is 't possible i' faith is 't true then would to god that i had never seen 't why do you speak so startingly and rash heaven bless us it is not lost but what an if it were i say it is not lost why so i can but i will not now this is a trick to put me from my suit pray you let cassio be received again come come you'll never meet a more sufficient man i pray talk me of cassio a man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love shared dangers with you  i' faith you are to blame i ne'er saw this before sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief i am most unhappy in the loss of it how now good cassio what's the news with you alas thrice gentle cassio my advocation is not now in tune my lord is not my lord nor should i know him were he in favor as in humor altered so help me every spirit sanctified as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech you must awhile be patient what i can do i will and more i will than for myself i dare let that suffice you i prithee do so something sure of state either from venice or some unhatched practice made demonstrable here in cyprus to him hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases men's natures wrangle with inferior things though great ones are their object 'tis even so for let our finger ache and it endues our other healthful members even to a sense of pain nay we must think men are not gods nor of them look for such observancy as fits the bridal beshrew me much emilia i was unhandsome warrior as i am  arraigning his unkindness with my soul but now i find i had suborned the witness and he's indicted falsely alas the day i never gave him cause heaven keep that monster from othello's mind i will go seek him cassio walk hereabout if i do find him fit i'll move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost and what's the news good cousin lodovico cousin there's fall'n between him and my lord an unkind breach but you shall make all well my lord a most unhappy one i would do much t' atone them for the love i bear to cassio my lord what is he angry by my troth i am glad on 't my lord why sweet othello i have not deserved this i will not stay to offend you my lord my lord what is your will what is your pleasure what horrible fancy's this upon my knees what doth your speech import i understand a fury in your words but not the words your wife my lord your true and loyal wife heaven doth truly know it to whom my lord with whom how am i false alas the heavy day why do you weep am i the motive of these tears my lord if haply you my father do suspect an instrument of this your calling back lay not your blame on me if you have lost him i have lost him too i hope my noble lord esteems me honest alas what ignorant sin have i committed by heaven you do me wrong no as i am a christian if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet i am none no as i shall be saved o heaven forgive us faith half asleep with who who is thy lord i have none do not talk to me emilia i cannot weep nor answers have i none but what should go by water prithee tonight lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember and call thy husband hither 'tis meet i should be used so very meet how have i been behaved that he might stick the small'st opinion on my least misuse i cannot tell those that do teach young babes do it with gentle means and easy tasks he might have chid me so for in good faith i am a child to chiding am i that name iago such as she said my lord did say i was i do not know i am sure i am none such it is my wretched fortune nay heaven doth know if any such there be heaven pardon him alas iago what shall i do to win my lord again good friend go to him for by this light of heaven i know not how i lost him here i kneel if e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love either in discourse of thought or actual deed or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense delighted them in any other form or that i do not yet and ever did and ever will though he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement love him dearly comfort forswear me unkindness may do much and his unkindness may defeat my life but never taint my love i cannot say whore  it does abhor me now i speak the word to do the act that might the addition earn not the world's mass of vanity could make me if 'twere no other  your honor is most welcome my lord i will my lord he says he will return incontinent and hath commanded me to go to bed and bade me to dismiss you it was his bidding therefore good emilia give me my nightly wearing and adieu we must not now displease him so would not i my love doth so approve him that even his stubbornness his checks his frowns  prithee unpin me have grace and favor in them all's one good faith how foolish are our minds if i do die before thee prithee shroud me in one of those same sheets my mother had a maid called barbary she was in love and he she loved proved mad and did forsake her she had a song of willow an old thing 'twas but it expressed her fortune and she died singing it that song tonight will not go from my mind i have much to do but to go hang my head all at one side and sing it like poor barbary prithee dispatch no unpin me here this lodovico is a proper man he speaks well the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree sing all a green willow her hand on her bosom her head on her knee sing willow willow willow the fresh streams ran by her and murmured her moans sing willow willow willow her salt tears fell from her and softened the stones  lay by these sing willow willow willow prithee hie thee he'll come anon sing all a green willow must be my garland let nobody blame him his scorn i approve nay that's not next hark who is 't that knocks i called my love false love but what said he then sing willow willow willow if i court more women you'll couch with more men  so get thee gone good night mine eyes do itch doth that bode weeping i have heard it said so o these men these men dost thou in conscience think tell me emilia  that there be women do abuse their husbands in such gross kind wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world no by this heavenly light wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world in troth i think thou wouldst not beshrew me if i would do such a wrong for the whole world i do not think there is any such woman good night good night god me such uses send not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend who's there othello will you come to bed my lord ay my lord alack my lord what may you mean by that talk you of killing then heaven have mercy on me if you say so i hope you will not kill me and yet i fear you for you're fatal then when your eyes roll so why i should fear i know not since guiltiness i know not but yet i feel i fear they are loves i bear to you that death's unnatural that kills for loving alas why gnaw you so your nether lip some bloody passion shakes your very frame these are portents but yet i hope i hope they do not point on me i will so what's the matter no by my life and soul send for the man and ask him ay but not yet to die then lord have mercy on me and have you mercy too i never did offend you in my life never loved cassio but with such general warranty of heaven as i might love i never gave him token he found it then i never gave it him send for him hither let him confess a truth what my lord how unlawfully he will not say so o my fear interprets what is he dead alas he is betrayed and i undone o banish me my lord but kill me not kill me tomorrow let me live tonight but half an hour but while i say one prayer o falsely falsely murdered a guiltless death i die nobody i myself farewell commend me to my kind lord o farewell"}
