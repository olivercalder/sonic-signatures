fair hot wench in flame colored taffeta i see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day what none well how then come roundly roundly thou sayest well and it holds well too for the fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea being governed as the sea is by the moon as for proof now a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on monday night

excuse as well as i am doubtless i can purge myself of many i am charged withal yet such extenuation let me beg as in reproof of many tales devised which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear by smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers i may for some things true wherein my youth hath faulty wandered and irregular find pardon on my true submission i shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord be more myself do not think so you shall not find it so and god forgive them that so much have swayed your majesty's good thoughts away from me i will redeem all this on percy's head and in the closing of some glorious day be bold to tell you that i am your son when i will wear a garment all of blood and stain my favors in a bloody mask which washed away shall scour my shame with it and that shall be the day whene'er it lights that this same child of honor and renown this gallant hotspur this all praisèd knight and your unthought of harry chance to meet for every honor sitting on his helm would they were multitudes and on my head my shames redoubled for the time will come that i shall make this northern youth exchange his glorious deeds for my indignities percy is but my factor good my lord to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf and i will call him to so strict account that he shall render every glory up yea even the slightest worship of his time or i will tear the reckoning from his heart this in the name of god i promise here the which if he be pleased i shall perform i do beseech your majesty may salve the long grown wounds of my intemperance if not the end of life cancels all bands and i will die a hundred thousand deaths ere break the smallest parcel of this vow what say'st thou mistress quickly how doth thy husband i love him well he is an honest man what say'st thou jack what didst thou lose jack a trifle some eightpenny matter what he did not an otter sir john why an otter thou sayst true hostess and he slanders thee most grossly sirrah do i owe you a thousand pound i say 'tis copper darest thou be as good as thy word now and why not as the lion o if it should how would thy guts fall about thy knees but sirrah there's no room for faith truth nor honesty in this bosom of thine it is all filled up with guts and midriff charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket why thou whoreson impudent embossed rascal if there were anything in thy pocket but tavern reckonings memorandums of bawdy houses and one poor pennyworth of sugar candy to make thee long winded if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these i am a villain and yet you will stand to it you will not pocket up wrong art thou not ashamed it appears so by the story o my sweet beef i must still be good angel to thee the money is paid back again i am good friends with my father and may do anything i have procured thee jack a charge of foot bardolph go bear this letter to lord john of lancaster to my brother john this to my lord of westmoreland go peto to horse to horse for thou and i have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time jack meet me tomorrow in the temple hall at two o'clock in the afternoon there shalt thou know thy charge and there receive money and order for their furniture the land is burning percy stands on high and either we or they must lower lie how now blown jack how now quilt i think to steal cream indeed for thy theft hath already made thee butter but tell me jack whose fellows are these that come after i did never see such pitiful rascals no i'll be sworn unless you call three fingers in the ribs bare but sirrah make haste percy is already in the field the southern wind doth play the trumpet to his purposes and by his hollow whistling in the leaves foretells a tempest and a blust'ring day peace chewet peace in both your armies there is many a soul shall pay full dearly for this encounter if once they join in trial tell your nephew the prince of wales doth join with all the world in praise of henry percy by my hopes this present enterprise set off his head i do not think a braver gentleman more active valiant or more valiant young more daring or more bold is now alive to grace this latter age with noble deeds for my part i may speak it to my shame i have a truant been to chivalry and so i hear he doth account me too yet this before my father's majesty i am content that he shall take the odds of his great name and estimation and will to save the blood on either side try fortune with him in a single fight it will not be accepted on my life the douglas and the hotspur both together are confident against the world in arms nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship say thy prayers and farewell why thou owest god a death what stand'st thou idle here lend me thy sword many a nobleman lies stark and stiff under the hoofs of vaunting enemies whose deaths are yet unrevenged i prithee lend me thy sword he is indeed and living to kill thee i prithee lend me thy sword give it me what is it in the case what is it a time to jest and dally now i beseech your majesty make up lest your retirement do amaze your friends lead me my lord i do not need your help and god forbid a shallow scratch should drive the prince of wales from such a field as this where stained nobility lies trodden on and rebels' arms triumph in massacres by god thou hast deceived me lancaster i did not think thee lord of such a spirit before i loved thee as a brother john but now i do respect thee as my soul o this boy lends mettle to us all hold up thy head vile scot or thou art like never to hold it up again the spirits of valiant shirley stafford blunt are in my arms it is the prince of wales that threatens thee who never promiseth but he means to pay cheerly my lord how fares your grace sir nicholas gawsey hath for succor sent and so hath clifton i'll to clifton straight o god they did me too much injury that ever said i hearkened for your death if it were so i might have let alone the insulting hand of douglas over you which would have been as speedy in your end as all the poisonous potions in the world and saved the treacherous labor of your son thou speak'st as if i would deny my name why then i see a very valiant rebel of the name i am the prince of wales and think not percy to share with me in glory any more two stars keep not their motion in one sphere nor can one england brook a double reign of harry percy and the prince of wales i'll make it greater ere i part from thee and all the budding honors on thy crest i'll crop to make a garland for my head for worms brave percy fare thee well great heart ill weaved ambition how much art thou shrunk when that this body did contain a spirit a kingdom for it was too small a bound but now two paces of the vilest earth is room enough this earth that bears thee dead bears not alive so stout a gentleman if thou wert sensible of courtesy i should not make so dear a show of zeal but let my favors hide thy mangled face and even in thy behalf i'll thank myself for doing these fair rites of tenderness adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave but not remembered in thy epitaph what old acquaintance could not all this flesh keep in a little life poor jack farewell i could have better spared a better man o i should have a heavy miss of thee if i were much in love with vanity death hath not struck so fat a deer today though many dearer in this bloody fray emboweled will i see thee by and by till then in blood by noble percy lie come brother john full bravely hast thou fleshed thy maiden sword i did i saw him dead breathless and bleeding on the ground art thou alive or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight i prithee speak we will not trust our eyes without our ears thou art not what thou seem'st why percy i killed myself and saw thee dead this is the strangest fellow brother john  come bring your luggage nobly on your back for my part if a lie may do thee grace i'll gild it with the happiest terms i have the trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours come brother let us to the highest of the field to see what friends are living who are dead the noble scot lord douglas when he saw the fortune of the day quite turned from him the noble percy slain and all his men upon the foot of fear fled with the rest and falling from a hill he was so bruised that the pursuers took him at my tent the douglas is and i beseech your grace i may dispose of him then brother john of lancaster to you this honorable bounty shall belong go to the douglas and deliver him up to his pleasure ransomless and free his valors shown upon our crests today have taught us how to cherish such high deeds even in the bosom of our adversaries
