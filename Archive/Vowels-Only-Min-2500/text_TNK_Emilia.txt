no knees to me what woman i may stead that is distressed does bind me to her pray stand up your grief is written in your cheek pray you say nothing pray you who cannot feel nor see the rain being in 't knows neither wet nor dry if that you were the groundpiece of some painter i would buy you t' instruct me 'gainst a capital grief indeed such heart pierced demonstration but alas being a natural sister of our sex your sorrow beats so ardently upon me that it shall make a counter reflect 'gainst my brother's heart and warm it to some pity though it were made of stone pray have good comfort if you grant not my sister her petition in that force with that celerity and nature which she makes it in from henceforth i'll not dare to ask you anything nor be so hardy ever to take a husband thanks sir remember me to our all royal brother for whose speed the great bellona i'll solicit and since in our terrene state petitions are not without gifts understood i'll offer to her what i shall be advised she likes our hearts are in his army in his tent how his longing follows his friend since his depart his sports though craving seriousness and skill passed slightly his careless execution where nor gain made him regard or loss consider but playing one business in his hand another directing in his head his mind nurse equal to these so diff'ring twins have you observed him since our great lord departed doubtless there is a best and reason has no manners to say it is not you i was acquainted once with a time when i enjoyed a playfellow you were at wars when she the grave enriched who made too proud the bed took leave o' th' moon which then looked pale at parting when our count was each eleven yes you talk of pirithous' and theseus' love theirs has more ground is more maturely seasoned more buckled with strong judgment and their needs the one of th' other may be said to water their intertangled roots of love but i and she i sigh and spoke of were things innocent loved for we did and like the elements that know not what nor why yet do effect rare issues by their operance our souls did so to one another what she liked was then of me approved what not condemned no more arraignment the flower that i would pluck and put between my breasts o then but beginning to swell about the blossom she would long till she had such another and commit it to the like innocent cradle where phoenix like they died in perfume on my head no toy but was her pattern her affections pretty though haply hers careless were i followed for my most serious decking had mine ear stol'n some new air or at adventure hummed one from musical coinage why it was a note whereon her spirits would sojourn rather dwell on  and sing it in her slumbers this rehearsal  which fury innocent wots well comes in like old importment's bastard has this end that the true love 'tween maid and maid may be more than in sex individual i am sure i shall not i am not against your faith yet i continue mine this garden has a world of pleasures in 't what flower is this that was a fair boy certain but a fool to love himself were there not maids enough or were they all hard hearted thou wouldst not that's a good wench but take heed to your kindness though men are mad things canst not thou work such flowers in silk wench i'll have a gown full of 'em and of these this is pretty color will 't not do rarely upon a skirt wench of all flowers methinks a rose is best it is the very emblem of a maid for when the west wind courts her gently how modestly she blows and paints the sun with her chaste blushes when the north comes near her rude and impatient then like chastity she locks her beauties in her bud again and leaves him to base briers thou art wanton the sun grows high let's walk in keep these flowers we'll see how near art can come near their colors i am wondrous merry hearted i could laugh now and take one with you well agree then he is so believe his mother was a wondrous handsome woman his face methinks goes that way that were too cruel if you deserve well sir i shall soon see 't you're mine and somewhat better than your rank i'll use you that were a shame sir while i have horses take your choice and what you want at any time let me but know it if you serve faithfully i dare assure you you'll find a loving mistress i hope too wise for that sir 'twas an excellent dance and for a preface i never heard a better in my face dear sister i find no anger to 'em nor no ruin the misadventure of their own eyes kill 'em yet that i will be woman and have pity my knees shall grow to th' ground but i'll get mercy help me dear sister in a deed so virtuous the powers of all women will be with us most royal brother  by your own spotless honor  by that you would have pity in another by your own virtues infinite  by that you would have trembled to deny a blushing maid  last let me entreat sir  mercy on these princes upon their lives but with their banishments o my noble brother that oath was rashly made and in your anger your reason will not hold it if such vows stand for express will all the world must perish besides i have another oath 'gainst yours of more authority i am sure more love not made in passion neither but good heed that you would ne'er deny me anything fit for my modest suit and your free granting i tie you to your word now if you fail in 't think how you maim your honor  for now i am set a begging sir i am deaf to all but your compassion how their lives might breed the ruin of my name opinion shall anything that loves me perish for me that were a cruel wisdom do men prune the straight young boughs that blush with thousand blossoms because they may be rotten o duke theseus the goodly mothers that have groaned for these and all the longing maids that ever loved if your vow stand shall curse me and my beauty and in their funeral songs for these two cousins despise my cruelty and cry woe worth me till i am nothing but the scorn of women for heaven's sake save their lives and banish 'em swear 'em never more to make me their contention or to know me to tread upon thy dukedom and to be wherever they shall travel ever strangers to one another i cannot sir they are both too excellent for me a hair shall never fall of these men yes i must sir else both miscarry yet i may bind those wounds up that must open and bleed to death for my sake else i'll choose and end their strife two such young handsome men shall never fall for me their weeping mothers following the dead cold ashes of their sons shall never curse my cruelty good heaven what a sweet face has arcite if wise nature with all her best endowments all those beauties she sows into the births of noble bodies were here a mortal woman and had in her the coy denials of young maids yet doubtless she would run mad for this man what an eye of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness has this young prince here love himself sits smiling just such another wanton ganymede set jove afire with and enforced the god snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him a shining constellation what a brow of what a spacious majesty he carries arched like the great eyed juno's but far sweeter smoother than pelops' shoulder fame and honor methinks from hence as from a promontory pointed in heaven should clap their wings and sing to all the under world the loves and fights of gods and such men near 'em palamon is but his foil to him a mere dull shadow he's swart and meager of an eye as heavy as if he had lost his mother a still temper no stirring in him no alacrity of all this sprightly sharpness not a smile yet these that we count errors may become him narcissus was a sad boy but a heavenly o who can find the bent of woman's fancy i am a fool my reason is lost in me i have no choice and i have lied so lewdly that women ought to beat me on my knees i ask thy pardon palamon thou art alone and only beautiful and these the eyes these the bright lamps of beauty that command and threaten love and what young maid dare cross 'em what a bold gravity and yet inviting has this brown manly face o love this only from this hour is complexion lie there arcite thou art a changeling to him a mere gypsy and this the noble body i am sotted utterly lost my virgin's faith has fled me for if my brother but even now had asked me whether i loved i had run mad for arcite now if my sister more for palamon stand both together now come ask me brother alas i know not ask me now sweet sister i may go look what a mere child is fancy that having two fair gauds of equal sweetness cannot distinguish but must cry for both how now sir to end the quarrel would i might end first what sins have i committed chaste diana that my unspotted youth must now be soiled with blood of princes and my chastity be made the altar where the lives of lovers  two greater and two better never yet made mothers joy must be the sacrifice to my unhappy beauty i had rather both so neither for my sake should fall untimely must these men die too poor wench go weep for whosoever wins loses a noble cousin for thy sins o sacred shadowy cold and constant queen abandoner of revels mute contemplative sweet solitary white as chaste and pure as wind fanned snow who to thy female knights allow'st no more blood than will make a blush which is their order's robe i here thy priest am humbled 'fore thine altar o vouchsafe with that thy rare green eye which never yet beheld thing maculate look on thy virgin and sacred silver mistress lend thine ear  which ne'er heard scurrile term into whose port ne'er entered wanton sound to my petition seasoned with holy fear this is my last of vestal office i am bride habited but maiden hearted a husband i have 'pointed but do not know him out of two i should choose one and pray for his success but i am guiltless of election of mine eyes were i to lose one they are equal precious  i could doom neither that which perished should go to 't unsentenced therefore most modest queen he of the two pretenders that best loves me and has the truest title in 't let him take off my wheaten garland or else grant the file and quality i hold i may continue in thy band see what our general of ebbs and flows out from the bowels of her holy altar with sacred act advances but one rose if well inspired this battle shall confound both these brave knights and i a virgin flower must grow alone unplucked the flower is fall'n the tree descends o mistress thou here dischargest me i shall be gathered i think so but i know not thine own will unclasp thy mystery i hope she's pleased her signs were gracious i'll no step further i had rather see a wren hawk at a fly than this decision ev'ry blow that falls threats a brave life each stroke laments the place whereon it falls and sounds more like a bell than blade i will stay here it is enough my hearing shall be punished with what shall happen 'gainst the which there is no deafing but to hear not taint mine eye with dread sights it may shun pardon me if i were there i'd wink i am extinct there is but envy in that light which shows the one the other darkness which ever was the dam of horror who does stand accursed of many mortal millions may even now by casting her black mantle over both that neither could find other get herself some part of a good name and many a murder set off whereto she's guilty in faith i will not sir pardon me the title of a kingdom may be tried out of itself arcite is gently visaged yet his eye is like an engine bent or a sharp weapon in a soft sheath mercy and manly courage are bedfellows in his visage palamon has a most menacing aspect his brow is graved and seems to bury what it frowns on yet sometimes 'tis not so but alters to the quality of his thoughts long time his eye will dwell upon his object melancholy becomes him nobly so does arcite's mirth but palamon's sadness is a kind of mirth so mingled as if mirth did make him sad and sadness merry those darker humors that stick misbecomingly on others on them live in fair dwelling hark how yon spurs to spirit do incite the princes to their proof arcite may win me and yet may palamon wound arcite to the spoiling of his figure o what pity enough for such a chance if i were by i might do hurt for they would glance their eyes towards my seat and in that motion might omit a ward or forfeit an offense which craved that very time it is much better i am not there o better never born than minister to such harm what is the chance then he has won 'twas ever likely he looked all grace and success and he is doubtless the prim'st of men i prithee run and tell me how it goes run and inquire poor servant thou hast lost upon my right side still i wore thy picture palamon's on the left why so i know not i had no end in 't else chance would have it so on the sinister side the heart lies palamon had the best boding chance this burst of clamor is sure th' end o' th' combat were they metamorphosed both into one o why there were no woman worth so composed a man their single share their nobleness peculiar to them gives the prejudice of disparity value's shortness to any lady breathing more exulting palamon still i prithee lay attention to the cry set both thine ears to th' business half sights saw that arcite was no babe god's lid his richness and costliness of spirit looked through him it could no more be hid in him than fire in flax than humble banks can go to law with waters that drift winds force to raging i did think good palamon would miscarry yet i knew not why i did think so our reasons are not prophets when oft our fancies are they are coming off alas poor palamon is this winning o all you heavenly powers where is your mercy but that your wills have said it must be so and charge me live to comfort this unfriended this miserable prince that cuts away a life more worthy from him than all women i should and would die too i'll close thine eyes prince blessed souls be with thee thou art a right good man and while i live this day i give to tears
