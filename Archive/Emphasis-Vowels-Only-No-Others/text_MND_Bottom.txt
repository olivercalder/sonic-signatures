you were best to call them generally man by man according to the scrip first good peter quince say what the play treats on then read the names of the actors and so grow to a point a very good piece of work i assure you and a merry now good peter quince call forth your actors by the scroll masters spread yourselves ready name what part i am for and proceed what is pyramus a lover or a tyrant that will ask some tears in the true performing of it if i do it let the audience look to their eyes i will move storms i will condole in some measure to the rest yet my chief humor is for a tyrant i could play ercles rarely or a part to tear a cat in to make all split the raging rocks and shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates and phibbus' car shall shine from far and make and mar the foolish fates this was lofty now name the rest of the players this is ercles' vein a tyrant's vein a lover is more condoling an i may hide my face let me play thisbe too i'll speak in a monstrous little voice thisne thisne ah pyramus my lover dear thy thisbe dear and lady dear well proceed let me play the lion too i will roar that i will do any man's heart good to hear me i will roar that i will make the duke say let him roar again let him roar again that would hang us every mother's son i grant you friends if you should fright the ladies out of their wits they would have no more discretion but to hang us but i will aggravate my voice so that i will roar you as gently as any sucking dove i will roar you an 'twere any nightingale well i will undertake it what beard were i best to play it in i will discharge it in either your straw color beard your orange tawny beard your purple in grain beard or your french crown color beard your perfit yellow we will meet and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously take pains be perfit adieu enough hold or cut bowstrings are we all met peter quince there are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisbe that will never please first pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot abide how answer you that not a whit i have a device to make all well write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more better assurance tell them that i pyramus am not pyramus but bottom the weaver this will put them out of fear no make it two more let it be written in eight and eight masters you ought to consider with yourself to bring in god shield us a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living and we ought to look to 't nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck and he himself must speak through saying thus or to the same defect ladies or fair ladies i would wish you or i would request you or i would entreat you not to fear not to tremble my life for yours if you think i come hither as a lion it were pity of my life no i am no such thing i am a man as other men are and there indeed let him name his name and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner a calendar a calendar look in the almanac find out moonshine find out moonshine why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casement some man or other must present wall and let him have some plaster or some loam or some roughcast about him to signify wall or let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisbe whisper thisbe the flowers of odious savors sweet  odors savors sweet so hath thy breath my dearest thisbe dear  but hark a voice stay thou but here awhile and by and by i will to thee appear if i were fair fair thisbe i were only thine why do they run away this is a knavery of them to make me afeard what do you see you see an ass head of your own do you i see their knavery this is to make an ass of me to fright me if they could but i will not stir from this place do what they can i will walk up and down here and i will sing that they shall hear i am not afraid the ouzel cock so black of hue with orange tawny bill the throstle with his note so true the wren with little quill  the finch the sparrow and the lark the plainsong cuckoo gray whose note full many a man doth mark and dares not answer nay  for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird who would give a bird the lie though he cry cuckoo never so methinks mistress you should have little reason for that and yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company together nowadays the more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends nay i can gleek upon occasion not so neither but if i had wit enough to get out of this wood i have enough to serve mine own turn i cry your worships mercy heartily i beseech your worship's name i shall desire you of more acquaintance good master cobweb if i cut my finger i shall make bold with you your name

most fair pyramus hey ho peter quince flute the bellows mender snout the tinker starveling god's my life stolen hence and left me asleep i have had a most rare vision i have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream methought i was there is no man can tell what methought i was and methought i had but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought i had the eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen man's hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was i will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream it shall be called bottom's dream because it hath no bottom and i will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke peradventure to make it the more gracious i shall sing it at her death where are these lads where are these hearts masters i am to discourse wonders but ask me not what for if i tell you i am not true athenian i will tell you everything right as it fell out not a word of me all that i will tell you is that the duke hath dined get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look o'er his part for the short and the long is our play is preferred in any case let thisbe have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails for they shall hang out for the lion's claws and most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and i do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy no more words away go away o
